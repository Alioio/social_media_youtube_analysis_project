Melancovhich(sp) cycles, obliquity, orbital eccentricity, solar cycles, etc. Human forced climate change also happens. The problem is that CO2 is a cycle and has net effects that can be both bad and good. If you start taxing people for Carbon you are essentially an overbearing control freak who is looking at the bad things only, inflating them to use words like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and then trying to ruin everyone&#39;s life by trying to change in a short span of time and thus losing your audience. What scientists should be doing is stating the fact that we have gone from 264ppm to 400ppm and that while a minor rise it can cause small rises in temperature if there are no feedback cycles. This can and might cause planet wide greening, possibly strong storms (or weaker ones due to more energy in the atmosphere creating more chaos and thus preventing organized storms from forming as often). They should then point out that while carbon has been as high in the way past as 7000ppm the change we are making on the environment is slightly faster than purely natural (though humans are a natural part of earth and our brains make tech so could be argued that we are in fact natural) and this may cause stresses on other creatures and the environment. They should then present a holistic commons sense plant to move to renewable energy, because as tech improves they start making sense, and well, oil is much more valuable for making things than burning. This way environmentalists don&#39;t come off as self righteous ass hats that want to control everyone and we make a gradual shift over time without economic disaster happening. Meanwhile lets worry abut the thousand other problems we have that will kill us before a slight possible two degree warming that may actual avert an ice age we should be in right now.

Each day us pilot before we fly set the QNH on the altimeter, On the sub scale on the altimeter with the little knob on the right. If we are at a controlled airfield. The air Traffic control gives us the current reading for the day. It varies a little. But the standard barometric pressure on the earth is 1015 Mbs. Do you realize that in 1942 in World War 2 the standard barometric sub scale setting was 1015mbs. BUT HEY !!!!!!!!!! Its still the same to-day. So how can people say the world is suffering from climate change with the air pressure on the earth is roughly the same. And if Adam and Eve had an altimeter the sub scale setting would be the same 1015 mbs. Lets talk common sense and science . The earths air pressure is stable.

That&#39;s also true.<br /> There was a problem of discounted data which negatively impacted the reliability of the global temperature results. Richard made that known publicly and took political heat for exposing that. It was a shame and hurt the credibility of these studies.<br /><br /> There are other factors that effect climate that don&#39;t seem to make the news such as vapor trails from planes that block the Sun&#39;s light from radiating to the ground. Is the net affect a cooling one because the Sun:s rays are blocked somewhat or is it heating effect because they act as a blanket at night trapping the heat from the Sun in?<br /> Then there is a question of the clouds. In a warmed planet will the clouds be more abundant and if so what&#39;ll be the effect as in the case of vapor trails?<br /> I live in Central America and if you ask a local when is your winter?

The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn’t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines?

The strongest portion of the sun&#39;s magnetism is closer to its North and South Pole than it is to its equatorial line. The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) around the galactic center, when the heliosphere comes in contact with Galactic dust, the dust that doesn&#39;t get through is compressed against the magnetic wall of the heliosphere. These particles are forced to slip along the heliosphere&#39;s magnetic field lines accelerating from the pressure of the cosmic dust consistently pressing against the heliosphere as its travels, because new dust is constantly bombarding the heliosphere as it travels around the Galaxy. A large quantity of this debris floods into the heliosphere&#39;s crowns that encircles each pole of the Sun. The speed of these particles are accelerated by this process to speeds much greater than the solar wind. There is only about 3 probes that could confirm this Theory Voyager 1 and 2, and they are not Advanced enough nor do they have enough power to truly monitor heliosphere activity, the systems on those probes are being shut down to preserve power. I believe the Japanese have one probe that orbits the Sun specifically to monitor it&#39;s polar activity, once again it either lacks the technology, or The Operators simply don&#39;t know what to look for. When our heliosphere enters the magnetic field lines that stretches out fom the galactic core, the places where Cosmic dust accumulates most densely. The pressure between our heliosphere and the cosmos increases greatly and the speeds in which the dust travels is increased as well. The coronal hole masses at each pole are always there because the dust has always been there, coming in to the Sun, first to aid in the creation of it and after to fuel it, only it comes in at different rates depending on planetary alignments and the heliospheres position in the galaxy, as it travels through galactic magnetic field lines of structured dust density differences. The Milky Way&#39;s magnetic field structure is complicated, do to all of the various different dust, gas, stars, etc. That adds to the complexity of it&#39;s field. If you take away all these stars, dust, etc., and leave the galactic core then it&#39;s magnetic fields uniformity and cyclical nature are revealed. This uniformity is there with or without the other stars, planets, quasars, etc. it&#39;s just been added too, masked, and compounded when they are present. These cyclical galactic field lines my even be directly responsible for our solar cycles, and the planetary alignments my only play a small part in the cycles intensity. I downloaded an app called Solar System Scope, and I used it so that I could type in dates of years with record temperatures to see if it would illustrate planetary alignments, and it had appeared that every significant alignment had contributed to extreme weather anomalies during the minimums, and maximums, however I could find no consistency that would explain solar Cycles. Back to magnetic fields. The Milkyway&#39;s magnetic field is made up of fairly consistent distances between each field line. It most likely takes 22yrs for the Heliospheres to travel from one significant field line to the next. This would explain all of the phenomena that happens during a solar cycle. <br /><br />1. The sun&#39;s field reversal would happen when it enters the galactic magnetic field line, depending on witch hemisphere of the galaxy it is in. The <br />2. The minimums would occur apon aproch, passing through, and exiting galactic field lines.<br />3. Hale that occurs during minimums, do to the density of the dust in the galactic field lines. <br />4. Coronal hole activity increase from the extra dust, gas, and debris that accumulate at the galactic field lines. <br />5. The weakening of the heliospheres do to galactic magnetic interference, resulting in the Sun&#39;s magnetic reversal<br /><br />Some hipothisis are that the Milky Way galaxy is a two arm spiral galaxy. The arms of the Milky Way line up with Galactic field lines, this would be one of the strongest field lines, do to Compounded Galactic magnetic field resonance. Meaning that all the matter in that arm, stars, planets, gas, dust etc. would add to the magnetic field line strength. I think this might be the cause of serious catastrophic events on Earth.  <br />1205 pueblos",UCcq3GX2zKluCmyLuIABlVcQ,0,UgzgQZb8tQyZqQqkFxB4AaABAg,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

143,UgympMGZpvirzzfYQtR4AaABAg,1.0,2,2019-11-07 21:54:28,Jason Melton,"According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth&#39;s overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years. That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth&#39;s overall temperature 800 years ago. World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to &quot;fight&quot; climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle. The following is the source of this information:<br /><br />Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core<br /><br />Investigators<br />J.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius<br />Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l&#39;Environnement,<br />CNRS, BP96,<br />38402 Saint Martin d&#39;Heres Cedex, France<br /><br />N.I. Barkov<br />Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute,<br />Beringa Street 38, 199397,<br />St. Petersburg, Russia<br /><br />Period of Record<br />417,160 - 2,342 years BP<br /><br />Methods<br />In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the &quot;Grenoble analytical setup,&quot; which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).<br /><br />Trends<br />There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.<br /><br />References<br />Barnola, J.-M., D.

Of course it is, but your entire comment seems to slightly miss the point as what you call ""cool"" is just what's salient to normal people. Climate change may be interesting to a minority, but most people have little attention for things outside their immediate lives, especially when it's negative, and their individual actions can't have any clear or directly observable effect for them. It's hard to get people to care about things even when they can take steps that they can see the results of, like cleaning up their local environments. People already have many negative factors in their lives that are stressful and they can do relatively little about, with no direct result evident for those actions. So climate change is boring, in the sense that it doesn't hold people's attention, not that it isn't important. Flashy demonstrations are so common in science communication because most people don't care otherwise. Sure, other people don't use those methods when communicating issues... but most of them also don't have any real audience. They're preaching to the choir more and communicating to the average person less. That's fine, but it has limits. And I mean, isn't that the real job of communicators in general?

English isn't my first language and I know it may make my style a bit overreaching or... wanky? Well, as though I'm taking myself too seriously. Environment, ecology and the state of the Earth and how we manage it as a species are of major importance not only for me but for my children, grandchildren and, well, pretty much all my fellow humans. I started thinking seriously about it around 1969, so I think I have a pretty good knowledge of the subject. Back in the days, climate change wasn't even among the predictions scientists were then making about Earth's future. Want a proof? Have you read ""The Limits to Growth"", published in the early 70s? Sophisticated computer models that tried to figure out for how long we had as a planet given our birth rate, metal and other mineral mining and consumption, fossil fuel reserves, etc. Well, as astonishing and sobering it might seem, there was not a single one prediction about how greenhouse effect producing gases would increase average global temperature and melt the polar caps. Mind boggling! I returned to it not too long ago and indeed, scientists in 1970 weren't able to factor in the CO2 and CH4 contributions to climate. And here we are today, suddenly waking up as a planet and realizing what a mess we gave made. Of course, it doesb't invalidate the other conclusions contained in Limits to Growth, which summarizes the report the group called the Club of Rome sent to the UN. Despite its scientific shortcomings mostly due to the state of climate science at the times, it's extremely valuable reading and anybody who doesn't think climste change is boring should go through it.

We would have to rely on what climate scientists say. But what do they say? The article begins with: “SCIENTISTS claim we are in for a decade-long freeze as the sun slows down solar activity by up to 60 per cent.” Who are the “SCIENTISTS” that makes this claim? Valentina Zharkova is the only scientist mentioned and quoted in the article, and there is no reference to any scientific paper or anything at all. If a climate scientist actually made that claim, why would the author not cite or quote them? I seem to have managed to find the relevant paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/795/1/46 So it indeed seems like Valentina Zharkova is the main person in terms of this article. Why would anyone think anything else? The most logical conclusion is that the “we are in for a decade-long freeze”-claim is made by the author. A person who is not qualified to make such claim. He is not a scientist and certainly not a climate scientist. EDIT: Not sure what you think of iflscience.com, but they report that they spoke to Valentina Zharkova and wrote (among other things) this about it: She announced the findings from her team's research on solar activity last week at the Royal Astronomical Society. She noted that her team didn't realize how much of an impact their research would have on the media, and that it was journalists (including ourselves) who picked up on the possible impact on the climate.",UCLOAOWd_DST10sd3YX42h-A,1,Ugw8CVZ2_xwqfjwUV_d4AaABAg,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

My problem with &quot;Climate Change&quot; Is the agenda driven manipulation of data, where the IPCC, NASA, and many other government scientists clearly have an agenda. When the IPCC, and NASA put out reports about temperature rise, and manipulate, and cherry pick data, and ice levels, it makes it hard to take them seriously, as they are going against the data, and more towards &quot;climate models&quot; <br />Yes C02 levels are rising in our atmosphere, but it&#39;s much more complicated than that. Every climate model that has ever been looked at has not been capable of accurately predicting the future, and climate alarmists have been continually wrong for decades predicting sea level rise, and temperature rise, and ice recession in the arctics. Many climate scientists used to believe that the earth was cooling, and we were headed for the next ice age in the 70&#39;s, for example. Climate alarmists have also seem to have forgotten that some of the hottest periods on planet earth in recent history was the 1930&#39;s and 1940&#39;s. Why is it that people don&#39;t discuss this? I really recommend you check out some lectures from Tony Heller here on youtube, they are fantastic! I&#39;m not denying that we are dumping high levels of C02 into the atmostphere, but i am not in agreement that X PPM c02 is going to cause catastrophic climate change, or a runaway reaction, which some scientists have published data showing it is highly unlikely in the near future, especially since it seems to be the atmospheric pressure that affects the temperature, not the c02 content. If this was the case, Mars would be extremely hot, as it contains more C02 than earth!

First, the whole narrative depends on a mostly meaningless metric - global average temperature anomaly. Think about that for a minute or two. In any given place on the globe, temperature changes on a cyclical basis over the course of a 24- hour day, from a daily low, typically just before sunrise, to a daily high, typically several hours after noon, then falling slowly overnight to the next day’s low temperature. So, you average out the day’s high and low temperature, a range that might be only a few degrees, but might be as much as 20 degrees F on a given day, to find the average daily temperature for that location. Then you take that average, and average it out with the average daily temperature for every other place on Earth. So what? A completely meaningless metric. Second, there is ZERO persuasive empirical evidence that atmospheric CO2 is the primary driver of warming, or even a material driver of warming. The Earth’s climate has been constantly changing over its entire 4.5 Billion year history, either cooling or warming. Just in the last 12,000 years, a blink of an eye in geological terms, Earth’s climate has gone through several cycles warmer than today, from the Holocene Optimum, about 6,000-4,500 years ago, the Roman Warm Period, and the Medieval Warm Period, ALL warmer by 2-4 degrees C than today, and NONE caused by atmospheric CO2. Climate scientists can’t even identify or quantify the many natural causes of climate change, like solar cycles, changes in solar magnetic activity, changes in ocean currents, etc., yet we are supposed to believe the story that it is all (or even mostly) CO2?

How can we tell? Well, different mechanisms have different physical properties, as a result they have different fingerprints of where they will warm the quickest and have other fingerprints to test what is the likely primary cause, for example CO2 based warming will: * warm in the troposphere while cooling the upper atmosphere (observed and is relatively unique to CO2 based warming) * Warm the poles (With the exception of the 2 km thick eastern Antarctic ice sheet) quicker than the equator (observed) * Warm at night as much as the day (observed) * Reduce the long wave radiation going out into space (observed) These are the strongest fingerprints in the instrumental record indicating that whatever mechanism has all of these fingerprints combined is the primary cause.

Of course its a big problem that people don&#39;t really know what it is and they are trying to form opinions about it. But 1st- there are hundreds of millions of people who literally have no clue about it so they aren&#39;t even thinking about it, and 2nd- people who do more or less get it are very confused about the solutions. I am convinced from what I&#39;ve been reading on people&#39;s responses to news stories on Facebook about hurricanes and such that people think there are solutions out there that will not affect the way they live. I think there isn&#39;t really enough focus on that fact. Even in your video you refer to corporations who stand to benefit from the continual burning of fossil fuel, but not the affect shutting down these corporations will have on the average citizen. Many people think that if government policy would focus on punishing these oil companies and coal companies that the problem would be solved, and they could just go on living the way they do. I believe that if people really understood what carbon taxes would mean to their own pocket books-because no matter how much you may be able to tax oil and coal companies, you cannot force them to operate without a profit- there would be a lot less people blindly saying &quot;yeah, the government needs to do something!&quot;. The other problem is that people tend to want to place blame for problems happening today on very specific people. I&#39;ve seen people say storms should be named after George Bush since he and other &quot;climate change deniers&quot; are responsible for them. A lot of people who believe in the climate science completely misunderstand it. They believe for example that if we were to cut emissions back to 20% of 1990 levels that the earth&#39;s temperature would return to those same levels. This type of ignorance makes debating them very simple. People don&#39;t get that changes being suggested are really for the sake of people living over 50 years from now, that nothing we do right now can or will affect life in the near future, and when they say things like that they just cause an immediate negative defensive reaction to the person they are trying to pursuade. That really is all I got from Al Gore&#39;s first movie by the way.-Republicans bad, me good. As a progressive Republican actually interested in hearing what he said, I came away from the movie just thinking..&quot;what an ass&quot;.

Modern humans have been altering their environment for at least 25,000 years. We do not ""observe"" the world wide average temperatures are increasing, we choose to ""believe"" they are to suite your objectives; this is not science. One cannot take a world wide average temperature of the oceans and trivial helter-skelter collections of surface temperatures are just meaningless artifacts of our urban civilization. Radiosonde data from balloon and satellite surveillance of the layered atmosphere (where all this extra radiological ""trapping"" of IR wavelengths is presumably inculpating civilization) inform us that there is no significant warming effect based on out habit of keeping warm with fuel. Carbon 13 is a red herring, it is a stable isotope of carbon that diffuses at different rates in different environments than carbon 12 does due to its greater mass. There is no rational reason to conduct ""who-done-it"" crime fictions for carbon 13. We all accept that burning fuel has some affect on the atmosphere. From a biological viewpoint, it is a significant and beneficial food for life (life's fertilizer), but from establishing a slightly more beneficial radiological or thermodynamic equilibrium, it has been proven by real data to be so trivial as to be insignificant.",UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA,1,UgiP5Bxm54E29HgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

This is because plants have a preference for the lighter carbon isotopes (13C vs 12C), and fossil fuels are derived from ancient plants. We observe that while global temperatures and CO2 levels are increasing, the ratio of 13C/12C in the atmosphere is decreasing, and from this, we can infer that fossil fuels are causing the warming. So, here's my question: If anthropogenic global warming is a hoax, then what is causing the decrease of the concentration of the 13C isotope in the atmosphere?

Oh those Damn Vikings and their SUVs. There is BAD data to ""prove"" the entire globe is warming and challenge you to prove that the average surface temperature is either meaningful or can accurately be assessed. This “surface record” is laughably ill-suited to “prove” anything. The measurement standards are constantly changing and the methods of collection are neither spatially nor temporally suited to making “average” planetary temperature calculations. Furthermore, a daily high + low divided by two is a meaningless standard of average temperature. If the temperature is 100 degrees for the entire day at given a location but 10 minutes before midnight a cold front comes through and the temperature drops to 50 degrees what is the official “average” temperature for the day professor? The most damning evidence of climate fraud is presented by both balloon and satellite data that collect uniform tropospheric data at altitude where the physics of significant greenhouse warming is supposedly occurring. There is no evidence that any significant change in temperature has occurred even in the places where it should occur most intensely. That is over the warmest low latitudes of the planet. Balloon and satellite data correlate exceedly well and should be the gold standard yet they are largely ignored in favor of meaningless numbers purported to be “surface data” One other thing, our ill-educated public does not question is the role of temperature as a record of “heat” and you should know the correlation is only incidental. 100 degress of “heat” in the desert is trumped by 100 degrees of “heat” in the rain forest, yet none of these “temperature records” have been converted to joules of heat since there is no corresponding pressure and humidity record with which to do it. Carbon dioxide presumably traps heat, not temperature. No one doubts climate changes over decades, centuries, and millennia due to Milankovitch cycles, as well as ill-understood solar cycles, and oceanic heat cycles. No one doubts that human activities like farming, forestry, huge dam reservoirs, and burning fuels perturb the climate. What we doubt is that these human caused perturbations are either significant or harmful and we have evidence to prove it. This is why this warming cult refuses to debate our ilk.

But that's boring to the general public because you can only present them as numbers and figures, not visually melting ice. Hence they are not as popularly reported in mass media. ""Portions of the South Atlantic have actually cooled"" is another great example of cherry-picking data. Finding ONE example of a place that cooled does NOT prove global cooling, just like finding ONE example of a place that warmed does NOT prove global warming (see Medieval warming period). What's important is the GLOBAL data. And the GLOBAL data undeniably proves warming on an unprecedented scale.

Moreover, the data about the Medieval Warming Period is only as good as the collection of data, but no one has presented a case where a place of 3.9 x 10^6 mi*2 was uniquely warmed while the rest of the earth was unchanged. Meantime, to put a finer point on it, the global anomaly map shows clearly that major portions of the South Atlantic have actually cooled, larger in area than Greenland. OTOH, I have not said the cooler S.Atlantic is evidence of global cooling.  There may have been a 0.6-1 K rise in 150 years, a trivial rise on a fragmentary time scale compared to geological eras, in particular the 100 Kyr Milankovitch cycles.  Might as well conclude fatal heart problems for someone who ate shrimp before their cholesterol test, on the basis of a 500 mg/dL reading. Or even the ""pattern"" of 150-300-500 measured in 2 hour increments after the meal.  The data of your entire claim would fit into the Milankovitch cycle's presentation of 1 or 2 points of the thousands that make up each cycle, and may be just so much noise.  It is certainly not an existential emergency and AGW data does not support drastic action to curb anything.

It goes up and up and up until it cools and comes down as rain, it will always cool down since it can just go up and up into colder and colder air. CO2 is a much bigger problem.

Of course oceans release a lot more water vapor than humans do, but that water returns to them in precipitations: that water vapor has a cycle, a way of keeping itself in movement so it doesn't stay all the time in the shape of clouds. But we, with our activity, break that cycle, making more water vapor than it should be in the atmosphere. It may look insignificant, but it also contributes to climate change, as it does CO2. There is only 0.04% of CO2 in the atmosphere, and still it contributes to climate change! And that also makes the atmosphere warmer, making it harder for the water to return as rain. But what really bothers me is that you treat Derek as if he is some kind of bluffer that doesn't know what he's talking about. I'm sure that he doesn't make just videos for a living, but because he really likes teaching and getting people like you have a more open mind about learning new stuff.

He reckons that the conspiracy theorists claim that Al Gore and other like minded people invented Global warming in order to make themselves rich, which is not true(Where he is heading with his argument). Then he turns around and says that carbon taxes should be implemented.<br /><br />Who benefits from Carbon Taxes?<br /><br />If the idea behind carbon taxes is to make people use less of it and perhaps even encourage them to start using alternative solutions. Then obviously the makers of electric cars benefit more from it. The suppliers of alternative energy solutions benefit more from. Of course all these people have their little puppet in government trying to ensure that bills and regulations are passed which are more beneficial to them. A society driving around with internal combustion engines in their cars won&#39;t be beneficial to the maker of a hydrogen powered vehicle etc etc.<br /><br />Someone always benefits and they will ALWAYS buy and push their best interests in the public and political sphere. Heck, even small timers like Vegans would go out of their way to try and twist it to their own benefit by trying to argue that the animals are the source of the problem and if we as humans turned away from out reliance on animal products/foods then the footprint would be greatly reduced. No doubt they even have a puppet of their own on the political floors trying to do away with everything that is contrary to their own way of living and which does not benefit them.<br /><br />So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to suggest that Gore doesn&#39;t have anything to benefit from it or to try and make the so-called &quot;deniers&quot; out to be conspiracy nuts and oil puppets etc.<br /><br /><br />There&#39;s hardly a thing on this planet that doesn&#39;t get pushed for the sole purpose of benefiting one or other big corporation.",UCVEyEtGepdx8ujyBNVwzuNQ,0,UgiEwAzpb15J9XgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The carbon tax in Australia was likely repealed because the cost of energy became too high after it was enacted that a growing and productive economy in Australia would no longer be sustainable. The real solution to the human variable of climate change (climate change is inevitable humans or no humans) is to subsidize alternative forms of energy generation like low emissions renewables.

The ""average"" rates are so small that plate tectonics (the rise, fall and shift of continental land masses) is far more significant. Add to this wind and water erosion wearing at shores and sedimentation adding many miles of new coastline and the picture is muddled. The natural world is always far more complex than simple self-serving theoretical models offered for political purpose. Scientific minds are both questioning and skeptical of presumed knowledge. The religious mind accepts dogma on faith in either priests or scientists. You put your faith in government science while I have none. Why don't you tell me what country you abide in so I can show you data in lieu of misplaced fear and superstition. As for the world ""average"" temperature changing, I am prepared to accept the fact that it is. I am not prepared to accept that such changes can be accurately assessed and quantified or that any means of doing so are sound. This is particularly significant when it goes unquestioned that world average annual (and monthly) temperature can be assessed to an accuracy of 0.01 degrees C over the last 150 years. This is total nonsense that goes unquestioned by a malleable and stupid press. Also unquestioned is why past temperature records (actual observations) have been manipulated (altered) to make the past appear cooler than the observational record established. In my country (the USA) we comprise a very small portion of the Earth where 70% is covered by sea and another 20% is either uninhabited or has no comprehensive spatial or temporal record of local weather conditions. However the USA has ""the"" most comprehensive weather data of any country on Earth, even as inadequate as it is for determining its historical ""average"" temperature. I don't use such a subjective record of determining if climate change is of concern to the USA or even to the larger world but instead use highest and lowest ""recorded"" temperature records for each of our 50 states and have noted this: 25 of our 50 states set record highs in the decade of the 1930s, that's some 90 years ago. They have never been exceeded since. Over the last 20 years no states have set record highs and over the last 30 years only two states have set record highs. On the other hand, 9 of our states have set record lows over the same 30 years. Clearly my far-less-subjective data shows a country whose average temperatures are in decline. There is a wealth of hard data including growing season length (last frost to first frost) that contradict the political agenda of government (politically funded) climate ""science."" The USA maintains a USCRN (US Climate Reference Network) funded to establish a pristine geographically distributed network of weather stations that has been operational since 2005 (15 years) The purpose of this network was to establish the fact the global warming is impacting the USA. Here is the output of actual data (not models made of nonsense): https://i.stack.imgur.com/iMZirl.png You tell me, whats the verdict?

Major climate shifts that are of major impact are governed by known changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun which change the amount of our received radiation by as much as 5%. These cycles are called Milankovitch cycles. They are governed by Newtonian kinetics and gravitation. The shortest of these cycles is the precession of the equinoxes that completes one cycle every 26,000 years. This precession currently puts the Northern Hemisphere winters at nearly the precise time the Earth is closest to the sun. 13000 years from now the Northern winter will occur when when the Earth is most distant from the sun thus exacerbating the severity of Northern Winters and bringing on a new Ice age. To be sure this precession has the opposite effect on the Southern Hemisphere which, except for the Antarctic, is largely moderated by the predominance of oceans covering the majority of the Southern Hemisphere. There are two other major Milankovitch cycles describing changes to the declination of the polar axis to the ecliptic and the degree of eccentricity of the Earth's orbit around the sun being tugged into more elongated to more circular orbit by the gravitational influence of Jupiter and Saturn. These are much longer and more variable cycles. The length of time continental glaciers persist after the climate shift that created them is significant, in fact many thousands of years. Except for Greenland and Antarctica the continental glaciers have all but disappeared except in high altitude or high latitude mountain ranges. If all of these mountain range glaciers disappeared (no evidence they are) it would not significantly alter sea level. Both Greenland and Antarctica are gaining more ice each year than lost to melt. About 500 billion tons on average for Greenland and somewhat less for Antarctic which holds some 90% of the worlds glacial ice with Greenland holding nearly 10% with a small fraction of only 1 percent being held on all the world's mountain glaciers. As Antarctic and Greenland ice continues to accumulate to levels that cannot be sustained by their surface areas it is balanced by continuous shedding of ice at their continental margins at the sea. This glacial flow movement can take centuries so there should be no alarm about annual as well as decadal minor variances in total ice inventories. It's all small change on a planetary scale. Recently Greenland set two new records for increases in it's Surface Mass Balance (the 2016-2017 ice season and the 2017-2018 ice season) The 2018-2019 ice season is not complete but it should be close to average.

Sea rise was once dramatic as the vast continental glaciers that covered the Northern Hemisphere's temperate zones began to recede some 15,000 years ago. Sea level is a now only local phenomena at this period in geologic history. Is not glacial inventories that cause measurable sea level change now. Sedimentation and erosion cause seas to both recede or advance depending on which beach you are observing. Pacific islands used as bell weather for ""global warming"" now are rising instead of being submerged, Meanwhile the continents are rising, falling, and shifting much faster than the seas are gaining or losing liquid mass. I have taken the global average of all tide gauges sea level change rates and its a little more than positive 5 inches per century, down from previous centuries.

No matter how big you make the highway people will change their driving habits up to the point where the traffic plays a factor in your decision whether you should drive. More highway more cars etc. If we move away from fossil fuel by using high efficiency energy sources people will prosper and make more people. If you believe people are creating the problem... all solutions must include population growth control. I believe a rapid destabilization of the climate will also destabilize the human population which will likely reduce CO2.,UC6YdUEZLty2hn-EyQAHjDqw,0,UgjyQ1agiXk3ZHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Because on the deserts we have pretty much the same CO2 concentration, and almost no water vapour, so wouldn&#39;t it be the the perfect place to observe CO2 acting as this main climate forcing you claim it to be? We wouldnt need all that fancy modeling on expensive super computers. To prove CO2 is really able to do what AGW people say, all we need to do is simple, good old EXPERIMENTING: place gear to detect CO2 and water vapour concentration, as well as the air temperature, on deserts and other places where water vapour is rare, and do a climate study of the data. If CO2 is all that, we should see a clear reduction of atmospheric temperature range on the deserts, as well as a considerably lower drop on the temperature at night, dont you agree?",UCEHyJrAfH1ILg19cyRl3Xgw,0,UgjFUR_4jVFCNXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Even the largest, dryest deserts are still a part of the global weather system which severely affects their temperature. You'd have to find some measurement from 30 years back, get incredibly lucky to have the exact same weather conditions as that measurement, not just for a day, but for months. And only then could you do your experiment. The error factors just drown out any sensible data. To reduce the error you would have to sample many deserts over a long period of time. And at that point, why not just do what we're already doing: Take the global temperature instead. A much simpler and accurate experiment can be done in the laboratory. Just shine a light through a room filled with CO2 and compare how much infrared passes through it. The less IR makes it through the higher the greenhouse effect. This experiment has been done to death and it shows that CO2 is a greenhouse gas.

The earth average temperature, if indeed it is measurable, has risen according to records by 0.6degC in the last hundred years. It is known fact that the earth has been warmer than this prior to any industrial revolution causing pollution and colder than this, as well.

The trace gas CO2 is not the key factor in anything other than plant growth. Water vapor is the primary green house gas and we don&#39;t address the cooling towers in this video just the CO2. That one trace gas has fueled an entire industry that if they were fully implemented would still not significantly change global temperatures and will not provide the energy needed reliably or in the quantities needed. The other side of the science is that the earth during the entire time this debate has been going on has been in a cooling phase and it seems that recent discoveries of the suns mechanics is pointing to a 40-60% reduction in the suns output which indicates a mini ice age is upon us. ,UCDABiXuTxPny9Wnw6dedaJQ,0,UgjuvF-CfYusxngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

It does not cool the Earth. The Earth floats in a vacuum. There is *NO* other way than radiating it as low frequency light for the Earth to get rid of the heat that arrives as high frequency light from the sun. There's no cool breeze from space. If you feel a cool breeze it means that the air has dumped heat somewhere on Earth. That part of Earth has been heated by the air. The Poles are only about 40 below. They are shadowed from the Sun for 6 months. Without air carrying heat to them they'd drop to more than 200 degrees C below zero. The valleys that never see direct sun would drop to 270 degrees below zero. They're hundreds of degrees hotter than they would be without air dumping heat there.

Hmmm, seems a bit fishy, all the top Climate Scientists say CO2 absorbs IR and that in turn heats the atmosphere and has increased the temp of the lower troposphere resulting in Global Warming, or Climate Chave as it now called since the increase in temps flattened out. I however, agree with you. It does not 'trap' or hold onto the IR, it simply absorbs and re-emits the IR quite quickly. IR has an interesting property that it shares with the entire electromagnetic spectrum, it travels at 300,000,000 meters per second. That is pretty quick. So, when the Earth emits some IR that CO2 absorbs (roughly 8% of the energy the Earth emits) the CO2 absorbs it and re-emits it almost instantly. 50% gets emitted skyward and 50% back towards Earth. I'm with you all on that. So suppose the CO2 absorbs the IR at 1 meter altitude and redirects back to Earth for one whole second. It will have made 150,000,000 trips between the Earth and CO2 molecule at 1 meter. This will never happen, on the second trip it will have a 50/50 chance of being emitted skyward. That happens in 1/150,000,000 seconds. Let's say the IR photon reaches the upper troposphere at 12,000 meters and gets absorbed and in effect gets reflected back and forth over 1 second. It will make 12,500 trips in one second, and any that make it out of the atmosphere will reach the Moon's orbit in a little over a second. Do you see the issue? Light travels really fast so even if the IR photon that CO2 absorbs is absorbed and emitted several thousand times over the course of a second it has thousands of opportunities to escape. Now I'm a little suspect as to how much of the IR that the Earth emits in the bands that CO2 absorbs is actually absorbed as well. There is just over 1 mole of CO2, about 45 grams, per cubic meter of dry air at sea level. Now that is a lot of molecules, but you have to think about the space 1 mole of CO2 takes up in a cubic meter. Very little. The number of moles goes down with humid air and goes down with altitude. Curious, is there less Global Warming in Denver than say Death Valley? There is less CO2. So my point is that given the Speed of Light, and that CO2 does not hold onto energy for very long, has a lower Specific Heat Capacity than N2, O2, H2O vapor, etc, CO2 does not cause Global Warming. ""It doesn't heat the atmosphere. The atmosphere will be heated by the hotter ground and it will expand but that doesn't change the pressure as such. There's no ""top"" on the container, the atmosphere just fluffs up higher."" Right. The pressure is reduced by the expansion of the air-mass. If the air-mass's volume were fixed or restricted, then the pressure would go up and result in a rise in temps as well. So a couple things happen. The temp rises while the pressure remains relatively the same. PV=nRT So in order for the pressure to remain the same when Temps go up, the volume must also increase in tandem with temp. This is where Convection comes into play. When the volume increases and the pressure remains the same, the density decreases. The Earth's Gravity pulls more strongly on the cooler and more dense air above or around the heated and less dense air-mass and drags it to the surface. ""These mechanisms do occur (not the heating the air directly, but the rest of it) but they don't increase the transfer of energy to space, they just move it around on Earth more vigorously."" I do not nor have not argued that convection exists beyond the tropopause. When the temps start to rise with altitude in the Stratosphere, Convection loses its ability to move heat skyward. Energy moves from regions of higher temps to lower on average, so natural convection will not occur within the stratosphere which gains temp with attitude. However, it is not 'just' moving it around more vigorously. It is moving it from regions of high temp at the surface (average 15C) to regions of lower temps at the tropopause (average -56C). Our atmosphere is often called super thin, etc, but it is quite significant. The troposphere has a mass of 4,000 Trillion tons and has an altitude ranging from 6,000 meters at the poles to 18,000 at the Equator. There is a huge amount of room for the energy to be distributed and transferred to. The energy does not have to escape to space for it to escape the lower troposphere. You can see this by the altitude of the Tropopause. The fallacy that AGW advocates are blind to is just that, Convection need not transfer energy to space to cool the surface, it need only get the energy away from the surface. The Atmosphere has plenty of volume to do that and easily expands to grant more volume. ""Well no. Moving the air around within the atmosphere doesn't directly effect the radiation of light into space. That's the only way the energy gets away. Convection is within the Earth systems and only acts to even the temperature out (eliminates very hot and very cold spots)."" Never said it did. Gets away form where? The surface or the Earth's thermodynamic system? Again, energy does not need to get to space to cool the surface. It only needs to move skyward at 1 meter per second, 2.2 mph, to have a noticeable effect. Cooler air is at the same time dragged via gravity to the warmer surface where as you explained is heated via conduction. Are you saying that the volume of the atmosphere is not sufficient to move vast amounts of energy away from the surface towards the tropopause without dropping the temp? ""No, you're continuing to reason from the fallacy that convection moves heat off Earth."" Where are you getting this? If you move energy away from the surface via Convection and at the same time, as a condition of Convection, bring cooler air to the surface does that energy need to escape the Earth's Thermodynamic System to cool the Surface? ""That is however considered ""low"" probability."" No kidding, unfathomably low. ""It's about half a watt per square metre. A ""couple"" of watts would be easily enough to boil the oceans, so I'm glad it's not."" I'm calling BS.

Firstly because it needs some maths and Youtube doesn't allow those characters and secondly because the wiki article was pretty simple and I don't think I could explain it any more simply. ""If you stripped away the atmosphere you have a vacuum so you only have radiation to cool the surface"" We only have radiation to cool the surface now. That's *it*. There is no other way for heat to escape the Earth. The Earth is floating in a vacuum already. You probably live in a mid latitude and think of the air as 'cooling'. It's not. It transports heat from one place on Earth to another also on Earth. The poles are pointed at an angle to the Sun, so they get less heat from the Sun. They pick up heat from the air (and water) and on average radiate more into space than they get from the sun. In the mid latitudes and the tropics you're pointed toward the sun. There the Sun delivers more energy than the ground radiates away. Heat gets into the air (and water) and is carried away. Because you live there you think of air as carrying heat away. If you lived in the poles you'd think the opposite. Air (and water) brings heat. As far as the Earth as a whole is concerned, it does neither. Just moves it around on the surface. Yes without the air evening out the heat the temperature would be higher and lower. The average would be much lower. It would actually be much much lower as the oceans would freeze and the Earth would reflect more light. The temperature would drop to about minus 50 and *stay* there. It would stay there until the CO2 level built up (without rivers there would be no erosion, so less rock would be exposed and CO2 would be able to build up) to an enormous level and melted the oceans. This has happened before. ""If you removed all the so-called greenhouse gases from our atmosphere and were left with 4,950 trillion tons of N2 and O2, would there be a 'greenhouse effect'?"" No. The ground could radiate heat out into space unimpeded. The temperature would fall pretty fast because the imbalance would be huge. If you've ever been in the high mountains when the sun goes down, like that but *much* worse. Overnight temperatures in tropics would be far below zero even on the first night. The lakes would freeze over within a few days or weeks. The oceans would freeze over within a few months but would take centuries to freeze to the bottom. The temperature would stabilise around minus 50 C on average.

No, they don't absorb, in the sense you use it here. They scatter or redirect the light. It happens pretty much evenly through the atmosphere however if you think about say a swimming pool. You look down into it and you can see the bottom. The light is coming up from there. It starts to get an algal bloom and it gets harder and harder to see the bottom. Eventually you can see the bottom, but it's faint. Then beyond that you can't see the bottom, but you can see some distance down. As the bloom gets thicker and thicker what looks like the bottom of the pool gets closer and closer to the surface. It's not *exactly* like that but that's a good way to think of it. The ""surface"" as seen from above gets closer and closer to the top of the atmosphere. It's an effect that's very important in a runaway situation. The upper cloud tops become the place that the Earth is radiating light into space instead of the ground. That decouples the ground temperature from the feedback loop. That's what's happened to Venus. If you look down at Venus it looks cool in the IR light but that's because you can only see down to the cloud tops. The surface below that is much hotter. The visible light gets down to the ground, but the IR has a long and difficult journey to get to the cloud tops. ""If it heats the atmosphere does that heat increase the pressure within that region and cause the region to expand?"" It doesn't heat the atmosphere. The atmosphere will be heated by the hotter ground and it will expand but that doesn't change the pressure as such. There's no ""top"" on the container, the atmosphere just fluffs up higher. ""Greenhouse gases do not prevent convection it seems so much as increase it. H2O vapor is lighter than dry air so moist air is less dense than dry air so gravity tugs more strongly on the dryer cooler air.

CO2 absorbs a few bands of IR and that warms the air and that makes it expand and become less dense than other cooler air masses around it so gravity drags the cooler more dense air closer to the ground where more energy is transferred and the process repeats."" These mechanisms do occur (not the heating the air directly, but the rest of it) but they don't increase the transfer of energy to space, they just move it around on Earth more vigorously. You've worked out for yourself why AGW has increased storm frequency and intensity and why Polar air is being transported into the mid latitudes bringing freezing temperatures much closer to the equator and heating the poles.   ""You really need a real greenhouse to significantly slow the cooling of the surface. Convection can more than easily offset any IR absorption that a little extra CO2 traps for half a second or less."" Well no. Moving the air around within the atmosphere doesn't *directly* effect the radiation of light into space. That's the only way the energy gets away. Convection is *within* the Earth systems and only acts to even the temperature out (eliminates very hot and very cold spots). Radiation is what moves energy from the Sun to the Earth and from the Earth into Space.   ""I think you may be stuck on heat 'storage' and be blind to a great deal of heat transfer (cooling) that is taking place while heat is being stored for short periods. Convection is the result of huge amounts of energy being transferred from the surface to the tropopause. It takes a great deal of energy to get 4,000 trillion tons of matter swirling around even with the aid of gravity."" No, not stuck on heat storage at all. The heat transfer moves it around *within* Earth. Radiation moves it to and from. ""Now if you can show how the 'greenhouse' effect retards gravity or somehow prevents convection, then the AGW hypotheses may hold some water. Without something to stop convection, you will not see a rise in temps without a rise in incoming radiation."" No, you're continuing to reason from the fallacy that convection moves heat off Earth. ""I just can't see how a rise in temps at the surface happens without the mass of the atmosphere increasing or a rise in TSI reaching the surface."" Well the mass of the Atmosphere will increase as more water is added to it. The end case is that all the water in the oceans evaporates and the surface pressure rises to about 70 times what it is now. That is however considered ""low"" probability. It hasn't been completely ruled out, but it's not looking like it will happen. There's only a couple of watts per square metre in it though so it's possible.  There's no need for the energy coming in to increase to make it hotter on Earth if you change the temperature at which the amount leaving matches the amount arriving. Which is what has happened. Don't forget, that's how we're not at minus 18 C now. This is just an extension of an already existing effect. That's what the 3 atom molecules do. They don't ""stop"" or ""absorb"" the light. They redirect some of it back. Metaphor time again... Imagine you are looking at a monitor. It has a certain brightness. Then you put on mirrored sunglasses. The monitor looks dimmer because some of the light is being bounced back toward the monitor and not reaching your eyes. For the amount of light reaching your eyes to be the same as before, you have to turn the monitor up brighter. Replace ""Monitor"" with ""Earth"". ""Mirrored Sunglasses"" with ""3 molecule gas"" and ""Eyes"" with ""Space"". The amount of light reaching space has to equal the amount of light falling on the Earth or the Earth will change temperature. If you put a mirror in the Atmosphere that bounces some of that light back to Earth, then the Earth will increase in temperature until it gets bright enough that the amount of light leaving (as IR) matches the amount of light arriving (as visible light).

Black holes are black, they do not emit or reflect light, less you include Hawking radiation, but they are black for practical sake. They are also holes, an example of Runaway gravity of sorts. The Wishbone or Forks look like a wishbone or fork (2 pronged). Greenhouses are fixed structures that prevent convection. The Troposphere where almost all life exists is 80% of a 5,000 trillion ton atmosphere that is a 24/7 convection system. However, I'm not sure this hiccup is something to get hung up on. I just think holding onto the analogy is helping you and other AGW advocates miss some important phenomena that is occurring whilst CO2 is absorbing what can be considered a fairly low frequency/energy and not much of it. I've heard this 30 degrees cooler scenario before, but is was not explained. If you stripped away the atmosphere you have a vacuum so you only have radiation to cool the surface. The daytime temps I would think would be very high and I'd be curious to see how long it would take the surface to cool without the aid of convection. I'm not really sure that the average of -18C means much. Without an atmosphere to absorb much of the heat from the surface during the day, and one to hold onto heat at night, there would be wold extremes, which leads to me a new question.

You can work this out yourself if you want, the maths is doable but it's a bit involved for a Youtube post... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_law So what happens in reality is this. The light from the Sun passes through the atmosphere almost unhindered. That's why you can look up and see the Sun! Just comes in straight through the atmosphere. Bam, it slams into the Earth at the speed of light and some is reflected (which is why you can see the Earth from space) and some is absorbed. The absorbed light heats the Earth, raising its temperature. So it emits light too, but lower frequency (we call that InfraRed but it's just light we can't see). That light doesn't pass through the air as easily. Light that hits molecules with three atoms is absorbed and then re-emitted in a random direction. “Scattered” is the right term. You can see a similar thing in visible light in a fog. The droplets of water scatter visible light in a similar way (not the same, but very similar in effect) Some of that light gets scattered back to Earth so it never gets away. If you were looking down at the Earth in the InfraRed spectrum you'd still be able to make out the ground, just, but the air would look foggy or hazy. So the ground would start to heat up. More light is arriving from the sun than is able to leave through the atmosphere. As the ground heats up it emits more and more light until it's emitting so much that it shines through the InfraRed haze and equals the amount of light coming in. That's why it's 15 degrees C on average rather than minus 18 degrees C. So, that has a couple of effects. Firstly water is a bit snooty. As much as it can it behaves as though the air simply wasn't there. It maintains a pressure (Vapour Pressure) that's the same as the pressure you'd have in a closed flask that had a puddle of water in it, but you'd pumped out all the air. If you pressurise it to higher than that or cool it, then it turns back into water. You might have experience with compressed air. You'd know that you have to regularly drain the water out. That's the snooty water. It's no greater a percentage of the air in the compressor than it was outside, but you've raised the water vapour pressure higher than it would have been in a closed flask with no air, so it turns back into water. So, the amount of water in the atmosphere is dependent on the temperature. More temperature means more water. Water is one of those molecules in the air that has three atoms (two Hydrogens and an Oxygen). So more water also means it's harder for the light to get out from the ground to space. That sounds like it should just runaway and turn all the water to vapour. It doesn't because we're saved by that 4th power I mentioned. As the temperature goes up the amount of light the earth emits goes up faster than the increase in water vapour. That's good, that means we don't boil the oceans. However in the opposite direction, we're not saved. Near freezing point the water nearly all turns into solid water and the vapour pressure gets very low. If we were able to freeze the world down to minus 18 and then just step back and let it run, it wouldn't warm back up again. There wouldn't be enough water in the air. In fact because snow reflects more light than water or ground, it would reflect more of the sun's light and the temperature would actually fall even further. It all sounds a bit unstable. That's because it is unstable with just water. Water does the heavy lifting as far as keeping us warm, but it's too unstable to do a good job. When the going gets hard it turns into snow. So what keeps it stable enough for life? CO2. It's another 3 atom molecule. It's a slightly different shape and size to water so it scatters a different frequency of light (still InfraRed). It doesn't freeze out of the atmosphere (well, not on Earth anyway, it does on Mars). It keeps the Earth warm enough that there is liquid water on the surface and that means there's enough water vapour to keep us warm. It acts as a sort of master control for the whole system. Now if you increase the amount of CO2 it scatters more light which makes it warmer. Because it's warmer the vapour pressure of water goes up, which scatters more light. Again it sounds like we're headed for disaster but the 4th power steps in again and saves us (just, there's actually not all that much in it, I can write more on that if you like, but the consensus is that it's unlikely to boil off the oceans, not out of the question, but unlikely). That was a big gulp. Questions?",UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA,1,UgiwGG0ILKKTf3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Everyone knows what we're talking about. A ""Black Hole"" is neither black nor a hole. Words change meaning all the time. In Italian, the bit that holds the front wheel of a bicycle is a ""Wishbone"", in English it's ""Fork"". In reality it's neither a fork nor a wishbone, but people know what you mean. That's how languages work. It is a sort of emissivity/absorption effect. Energy arrives on Earth as light from the sun, from just one direction (the sun's direction). It leaves in all directions. If the amount of heat in the planet stays the same then the amount of energy arriving equals the amount of energy leaving exactly. (Heat isn't temperature BTW, I mean *HEAT*, I don't mean temperature, more on that later) Everything emits light. You, me, the sun, the earth. The frequency of the light depends on the temperature. That's a quantum mechanical effect and I said I'd get a bit hand wavy at that point. Don't worry, AGW was discovered before quantum mechanics. You can just take that as a fact rather than trying to derive it from quantum theory. Hot things emit more photons and those photons carry more energy. That way you end up with a fourth power. Double the temperature and the power (power is energy per unit time) goes up not twice, but 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 times more. 3 times the temperature 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 times more. So the practical upshot is that the earth is heated only on one side. It intercepts light from the sun in a circle that has the area of a circle with diameter the same as the diameter of the earth. (makes sense...) It emits light over an area that's a sphere with diameter of the earth. 4 times bigger. So the earth is like a big frequency converter. It takes the high frequency light from the sun on one side and sends it out into space in all directions at a lower frequency (because it's colder than the sun) There are other sources of heat, radioactive decay, tidal warping (which is driven by orbital energy from the moon) and the energy of dust hitting the atmosphere (shooting stars). These sources of energy are completely insignificant and can be ignored. Now if that was the end of the story the surface temperature needed to re-emit the same amount of energy that arrives from the sun is about 30 degrees lower than the current average temperature.  TO BE CONTINUED IN THE NEXT POST.",UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA,1,UgiwGG0ILKKTf3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

1329,Ugim_HhtGpyqRXgCoAEC,0.0,2,2015-06-06 05:47:31,Diffeldofeldef The gnome,"Ever since the whole global-warming fracas began, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has been fudging and faking evidence and statistics in order to give the illusion that there was proof of human-caused global warming.<br /><br />This is well known, though unmentioned by our monolithic true-believer media, whose science coverage has become a mere church choir in the religion of eco-puritanism.<br /><br />The IPCC have performed illegitimate and unjustified statistical manipulations; they have reworded reports after scientists signed off on them, and without their knowledge.<br /><br />These are the kinds of things that you only do when you know that the evidence does not make your case. Nobody steals an election they&#39;ve actually won.<br /><br />Through all of this, they have insisted that human-caused global warming is a fact, and that anyone who resists it is in the same category as creationists and holocaust-deniers.<br /><br />This namecalling is another confession that they haven&#39;t got the data to make their case. If you have the data, you don&#39;t have to call names. The science speaks for itself.<br /><br />One reason they have been able to get away with this is the lack of data to contradict them. That is, the data we have had up to now did not say what they claim it said -- but it didn&#39;t say anything else, either.<br /><br />That&#39;s because everything was based on computer models, and computer models are only as good as the data that is fed into them. The people running the simulations were all True Believers, and so they always came up with &quot;results&quot; that mirrored the biased data they had been fed.<br /><br />But finally there is real data to feed into the computers. In a Dec. 18th Wall Street Journal essay, Matt Ridley reports on a conversation with Nic Lewis, one of the educated people keeping tabs on the global warming science issues for those of us who don&#39;t have access to the latest reports.<br /><br />If it weren&#39;t for people like Lewis, we laypeople would have no choice but to believe the deceptions of True Believers like the IPCC. Lewis is part of the reason we know about the previous lies and manipulations by the IPCC, but no one denies that the deceptions took place.<br /><br />Now, however, because Lewis is an honest observer, he reports that real data shows that there is a genuine statistically probable effect from atmospheric carbon emissions.<br /><br />What genuine scientists, faithfully reporting their actual findings, now report is that the mechanisms claimed to cause global warming may in fact contribute to a rise in temperature -- but they do so at a rate FAR, FAR LOWER than that assumed by the True Believers.<br /><br />We are finally getting a pretty good idea of the actual effects of carbon dioxide emissions. Comparing global temperatures over the past 100-150 years with the fluctuations in carbon dioxide emissions from human activities gives us -- at last -- a reasonable basis for estimating how sensitive global climate is to changes in carbon dioxide levels.<br /><br />Keep in mind that carbon dioxide is far from being the major greenhouse gas. Methane is far more important, and the most important, water vapor, has such unpredictable effects that it is left out of all the models.<br /><br />That&#39;s because water vapor, besides being a greenhouse gas, also forms clouds, which by their high reflectivity, bounce sunlight out of the atmosphere without converting it to heat. Storms also funnel heat from near the surface up to the higher atmosphere.<br /><br />We have no way of predicting or modeling how much the albedo and storm effects balance with the greenhouse effect, nor even to what degree global warming would increase cloud cover.<br /><br />As Ridley says in his article, &quot;As one Nobel Prize-winning physicist with a senior role in combating climate change admitted to me the other day: &#39;We don&#39;t even know the sign&#39; of water vapor&#39;s effect -- in other words, whether it speeds up or slows down a warming of the atmosphere.&quot;<br /><br />Says Ridley, &quot;Climate models are known to poorly simulate clouds, and given clouds&#39; very strong effect on the climate system -- some types cooling the Earth either by shading it or by transporting heat up and cold down in thunderstorms, and others warming the Earth by blocking outgoing radiation -- it remains highly plausible that there is no net positive feedback from water vapor.&quot;<br /><br />This matters a great deal -- the global warming alarmists&#39; warnings absolutely depend on the idea that carbon dioxide&#39;s warming, if real, will then be greatly amplified by water vapor increases. But this remains entirely a matter of faith. For all we know, increased water vapor may be the ecosystem&#39;s natural way of damping down the effects of global warming -- whether that warming is astronomical or human caused.<br /><br />We can now calculate with some reliability just what a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would do to global climate. &quot;Given what we know now,&quot; said Ridley, &quot;there is almost no way that the feared large temperature rise is going to happen.&quot;<br /><br />Ridley quotes Lewis as saying that, assuming a doubling of CO2 -- the IPCC&#39;s worst-case scenario -- and even assuming &quot;another 30% rise from other greenhouse gases by 2100, we are likely to experience a further rise of no more than&quot; one degree Celsius.<br /><br />Says Ridley, &quot;A cumulative change of less than 2O C by the end of this century will do no net harm. It will actually do net good -- that much the IPCC scientists have already agreed upon in the last IPCC report. Rainfall will increase slightly, growing seasons will lengthen, Greenland&#39;s ice cap will melt only very slowly.&quot;<br /><br />Historical evidence shows that global temperatures have been warmer than they are now, following natural cycles alone, in historical times. There seems to be a regular warming-and-cooling cycle, with cooling represented by the Little Ice Age of 1350 to 1850. In 1000 a.d., global climate was warmer than it is now.<br /><br />The same cycle seems to have corresponded with the collapse of agriculture and population during the cooling phase in the late Roman Empire and through the Dark Ages -- a plague-ridden era like the Little Ice Age.<br /><br />The historical evidence suggests that eras of global warming are natural, that they are beneficial, that they can best be called &quot;good weather.&quot;<br /><br />When you add to this the fact that all of human history has taken place in a ten thousand year lull in the great Ice Age that has dominated the last million years of Earth&#39;s climate history, and I, for one, wish that we could control and warm the climate through mere carbon dioxide emissions -- because when the major astronomical cycles bring back the Ice Age, our descendants will very much wish for a means of causing global warming on a vast scale.<br /><br />Meanwhile, keep in mind that there is nothing unnatural about the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere. All the carbon in the coal and oil and natural gas that we dig or pump up from under the surface was once atmospheric carbon dioxide.<br /><br />Carbon dioxide is fertilizer for all plant life. For millions of years, the coastal jungles of the dinosaur era sequestered natural atmospheric carbon dioxide and kept it out of circulation.<br /><br />In effect, we have starved for CO2 for millions of years because all those plants selfishly drank up all the atmospheric carbon they could and then thoughtlessly died without returning it to the atmosphere.<br /><br />We&#39;re only putting it back where it started.<br /><br />And every serious climate scientist has to admit this fact: Whatever else our carbon dioxide emissions might be doing, they are definitely fertilizing forests and grasslands all around the world. Where humans are involved, that means orchards and grainfields.<br /><br />If we really did reduce our CO2 emissions, it would cause a worldwide decrease in crop yields. That&#39;s a fact, not a computer model.<br /><br />The real limiting factor should be this: The supply of oil and coal is finite. It was larger than the alarmists of the 1970s and 1980s supposed, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we will never run out. It is quite possible that in a mere two centuries of fossil fuel consumption, we will use up the entire supply of accessible sequestered carbon.<br /><br />That, not groundless fears of global warming, is the reason we need to find other means of generating energy. Instead of worrying about carbon emissions, we need to search desperately for a means of powering our transportation and heating and cooling our habitations that does not depend on a resource that, once it runs out, is gone forever.<br /><br />My fear is that because of all the lies and deceptions, all the oppression of dissent and nastiness of the global warming alarmists, the general public, once free of those delusions and lies, will think that all warnings and dangers are false.<br /><br />In other words, we have been through three decades of massive wolf-crying about a nonexistent wolf, so that people won&#39;t believe in the need to deal with the real wolf of depleting resources.<br /><br />We have a responsibility to future generations to leave them with the resources necessary to sustain a modern society. It is a sin to burn it all up when we don&#39;t have to. CO2 is a non-issue and always has been -- only the eco-puritans took it seriously and then foisted it on laypeople who trusted in &quot;science.&quot;<br /><br />The net effect of their falsehoods will be a loss of trust in real science, and that&#39;s a crime. Because there are dangers to the environment, and serious consequence from burning up resources that can never be renewed. And thanks to the global warming clowns, I fear that nobody will pay attention.",UCdyexQ5aO1iLujlCcJJIWxw,0,Ugim_HhtGpyqRXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Surely, if cows were to blame, then people would be too? But we're not. Because cows eat grass. All the carbon in that grass was taken from the air. So even when we eat a steak and release that carbon in our breath, there is no net change in atmospheric CO2. So how are cows to blame? Well, cows actually release a lot of methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. If this is how you count it, the cow population has an exorbitant effect on emissions. But methane decays into CO2 in the upper atmosphere - finally releasing CO2 the grass sequestered - so its effect is limited as the atmosphere returns to its pre-cow state. This means the only effect that cows have on global warming is sustaining a small amount of methane in the upper atmosphere.

The more sunlight gets reflected the less heat gets in. Now everything that is hot radiates electromagnetic waves, the hotter the higher the frequency. The earth mostly radiates infrared waves and this is the outgoing radiation. (The sun is hotter -> higher frequencys) So you have incoming heat in the high frequency spectrum. And outgoing heat in the low frequency spectrum. So there is a balance. Now CO2 absorbs outgoing low frequency radiation that normaly gets through without a problem. If this radiation gets blocked by the CO2 the heat stays in. That is the greenhouse effect. If the same amount comes in but less goes out the heat increases. And you can actually prove that CO2 absorbs low freqency electromagnetic waves. And it is proven. It is a little simplified (I left out radiation windows) but it will do. Emperical Analysis: The CO2 concentration in the athmosphere has risen parallel to the temperature so there is a correlation. Does it matter? - 1-2°C maybe doesn't sound like much but it is the average! Climate change also means that temperature differences become more extreme. Why? Because at the equator more radiation is incoming - so less outgoing radiation makes a bigger difference there. While the difference is smaller in colder areas. Extremer temperatures are bad alone. - But higher temperature differences also cause winds (which are basically heat exchanger) to get stronger. Say hello, to stronger hurricans americans! - And the change of the climate disrupts a lot of balanced water/air circuits. There are some reasonable theorys that the gulfstream might be stopped because of that. (I won't explain that because I am not an expert and I may explain something wrong. But it has something to do with the sinking of the water of the gulfstream in the north, being affected by the melting of the ice). This would cause the temperature in Europe to drastically sink. It would be as cold as Canada basically. And Europe is a high density and fertile region right now. - The rise of the sea levels will flood a lot of low regions and cause migration movements. So sounds like a lot of fun. I don't think that humanity will be wiped from earth because of that. We will survive somehow. Especially the rich and high developed countries. But it will become a lot more uncompfortable. Political Analysis: You have big oil companys with a lot of money that would not profit from a change in the mindset of people. And then you have some activists [without money!] that want to do the right thing, simply because it is right. You have lots of scientists that state, that the climate change is real. And few that state it would be a lie. Now you want to tell me, that the big oil companys bought less scientists with all their money than some people with the world in mind.

The more sunlight gets reflected the less heat gets in. Now everything that is hot radiates electromagnetic waves, the hotter the higher the frequency. The earth mostly radiates infrared waves and this is the outgoing radiation. (The sun is hotter -> higher frequencys) So you have incoming heat in the high frequency spectrum. And outgoing heat in the low frequency spectrum. So there is a balance. Now CO2 absorbs outgoing low frequency radiation that normaly gets through without a problem. If this radiation gets blocked by the CO2 the heat stays in. That is the greenhouse effect. If the same amount comes in but less goes out the heat increases. And you can actually prove that CO2 absorbs low freqency electromagnetic waves. And it is proven. It is a little simplified (I left out radiation windows) but it will do. Emperical Analysis: The CO2 concentration in the athmosphere has risen parallel to the temperature so there is a correlation. Does it matter? - 1-2°C maybe doesn't sound like much but it is the average! Climate change also means that temperature differences become more extreme. Why? Because at the equator more radiation is incoming - so less outgoing radiation makes a bigger difference there. While the difference is smaller in colder areas. Extremer temperatures are bad alone. - But higher temperature differences also cause winds (which are basically heat exchanger) to get stronger. Say hello, to stronger hurricans americans! - And the change of the climate disrupts a lot of balanced water/air circuits. There are some reasonable theorys that the gulfstream might be stopped because of that. (I won't explain that because I am not an expert and I may explain something wrong. But it has something to do with the sinking of the water of the gulfstream in the north, being affected by the melting of the ice). This would cause the temperature in Europe to drastically sink. It would be as cold as Canada basically. And Europe is a high density and fertile region right now. - The rise of the sea levels will flood a lot of low regions and cause migration movements. So sounds like a lot of fun. I don't think that humanity will be wiped from earth because of that. We will survive somehow. Especially the rich and high developed countries. But it will become a lot more uncompfortable. Political Analysis: You have big oil companys with a lot of money that would not profit from a change in the mindset of people. And then you have some activists [without money!] that want to do the right thing, simply because it is right. You have lots of scientists that state, that the climate change is real. And few that state it would be a lie. Now you want to tell me, that the big oil companys bought less scientists with all their money than some people with the world in mind.

Most of the time it's paying to employ millions of obtuse, useless bureaucrats, or bombing foreign countries, or researching projects that somehow require $50,000 toaster ovens.  Sure, it can fund some research that yields important discoveries, but that can be voluntary, it's not the government that does that in the end, it's us who pay for it. ",UCNe-2bQv3BWT0TIns5edqbA,1,Ugjjv-tdA5jqjHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

A carbon tax would increase energy costs significantly if applied overall. Transport Costs could be affected as well if the carbon tax were applied to petrol. Most of us don&#39;t want that.<br /><br />Also lowering The CO2 emitions wil not stop them. Even stoping The CO2 emitions all together , there is so much CO2 released that the climate won&#39;t remove on it&#39;s own. And we cannot force every country to do this, just because one country goes green does not mean other will follow suit.<br /><br />My opinion is that we do not have accurate understanding how climate change will change habituation. We don&#39;t know the extend of desertification nor do we know the extend of more habitable location that was previously too cold. <br /><br />We as a species have already decided that lowering out energy costs is out of the question, the increased CO2 pollution is something we are largely content with. It might be our downfall.<br /><br />We have nuclear power that is by far cleaner than any other form on energy production (even to renewables!) historically very safe, even if you factor all disasters that have happens. Alas mainstream population is much to scared of Nuclear power. So it isn&#39;t a reasonable solution until costs will drive us to it. Look at Japan they restarted nuclear power programs.

The straight answer is: not many. The consensus argument often appears, but it involves a sleight of hand. Consider the following: 1. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. 2. Data shows that pCO2 is increasing and we know man emits CO2. 3. Man has an impact on the climate. 4. We have to reduce CO2 to save the planet from catastrophic warming. The first 3 points are basic uncontentious issues. Few (possibly no) scientists would disagree with any of these. For example, agriculture and urbanisation are reasons to consider a human influence on the climate. Consensus surveys concentrate on the first three points.  Surveys never directly test point 4. However when it comes to discussing the consensus, point 4 is usually conflated with the others. An example is about 2.41 in the video. A range of temperature rises are mentioned (1.4 to 2.6 degC with a 90% confidence interval). It is commonly recognised that the lower range is not a problem. So he is right to say the scientists are offering carefully worded predictions, but scientists are NOT having an issue with communicating this to the public. It is the activists in Big Green that have a problem convincing the public of their POV. About 2.00 the presenter mentions consensus (grounded in points 1-3), and then seamlessly moves onto talking about ""carbon"". No effort is made to say ""scientists agree that human CO2 emissions will cause a climate catastrophe"" (or words to that effect) Bear in mind that the video is sponsored by the Climate Reality Project (as declared at the end) - or ""Al Gore and his friends"" to borrow the presenter's words.",UCExGhjkRbKmPqX5S_-fcXig,1,UggPe-FCDlqks3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Then look up ""CO2 Feedback"" - you'll find out that the slight change in insolation from the orbital cycles is not enough by itself to change the climate as much as it did. Now back to Milankovic: you'll notice how the Holocene Interglacial is unique in that the orbital cycles are aligned such that the interglacial conditions will continue for tens of thousands more years (unlike previous interglacial which lasted less than 10 thousand) Now back to the CO2: humans are on track to double the CO2 content in the atmosphere from pre-inductrial levels, which is universally agreed (even by skeptics) to cause warming. How much? the consensus is that by 2100 it will be about 3 degrees C. And please don't mention the 'pause': we are currently in the quietest sun in over a century, plus all other natural factors should be driving a cooling; yet the world has had the hottest 10 years since record in the past 15 years.

The one thing they love the most are experts that agree with them. When it is beyond them to defend the faith they simply dismiss the infidels as inferior to their ""experts"" , the example most vomited out is scientific ""consensus"".  The majority of witch doctor ""climate"" scientists (dependent on the myth) agree ....... I am currently free from religion and claim the Agnostic label with a caveat or two.

Milankovitch cycles are one known factor that acts on climate over very long time periods.  Obviously the sun is the force driving the bus.  Human's are a smudge on the fender.  You really should stop reading about this topic - you are in for the world's biggest let down - you are learning and regurgitating everything science is not - I promise you.  To think that by examining a system like global climate which is so vast - you could come upon true understanding via some half assed process of elimination is beyond pathetic,  The people you put your FAITH in are Svengali not scientist.  everything you need to understand the situation is right in front of you - it is religion not science.  Understanding via elimination is a religious practice. Your statements make no sense - any system that is susceptible to positive feedback is unstable.  If CO2 in Jurassic was 2400ppm and other periods were 4000ppm - in a positive feedback system these levels would run warming right off the edge and it could not return.  Life has always thrived during warm periods and struggled during cold periods = ice age will stress our civilization not warmth. CO2 is a weak GH gas that has a very small warming effect in a SEA of stronger factors.  It lags temp and has a pretty strong correlation = r coefficient with warmth = the warmer the climate the higher the emission to absorption rate equilibrium set point.  the ocean is huge and stores much gas - it takes years for the ocean to release its CO2 to reach equilibrium with higher temperature.  CO2 is one very weak positive feed back in a SEA of strong negative feed backs such as clouds and concentration gradient - entropy = elements seek dispersion not collection in huge atm store of CO2.  Absorption via the gas transfer into ocean hastens as CO2 in atm increases.  This is not climate science but basic physics and thermodynamics. Your climate FAITH breaks the laws physics and chemistry - but more importantly breaks the laws of common sense.  It has no FACE VALIDITY = the most important concept from science = face validity = how could an unstable system support life for 3.5 billion years and how could a system PERTURBED by such a small push not have already run off the edge.  Do you even know what it means to have a system ruled by positive feed back - it is impossible to sustain in a dynamic environment = quickly runs to one side and tips. Of course we see a climate history where CO2 is correlated with temperature = the ocean spits CO2 when its hot and drinks it when its cold = duh. The predictions of of the Bible have a far better track record than the predictions of you witch doctors.  Vote for me and I will save you from the evil capitalist that is ruining your weather = so stupid and embarrassing you should never step out from behind web anonymity.  There is less real evidence supporting the big bang or invalidating creationism then evidence invalidating global warming.  The difference between global warming and Christianity is only global warming has been proven to 100% certainty to be completely false - at least there is some small possibility of a very slim chance of a God.  There is zero chance of AGW and its 5 pillars.",UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

But that net change would be unnoticed is based entirely on your feelings, not research and/or calculations. It went up a little last century with two odd warming periods the 30s and 40s and 80s and 90s.  There is NO reason to think this century will be any different than any other = man is INSIGNIFICANT and really can be excluded from the calculation.   2) Why would oceans rise so little? That is how much they went up last century and none cared. 3) Of course, rise can not exponentially grow forever. You didn't factor in positive feedback rising CO2 levels even more than man, warmed sea. See last post and re read everything 1965 has posted about the absurd notion of positive instead of the rational notion of negative feed back. 4) What's below? Did you mean temp. or CO2 levels? Logically it's the temperature that reaches and there you admitted that CO2 will influence the temperature. Why would CO2 absorption rate increase? Also, you didn't factor in positive feedback. Warmer oceans release more CO2 into the air, trapped methane releases when permafrost melts, melted sea ice will reveal darker water underneath and warming is more intense. CO2 will largely correlate to temp = it takes a little while for the ocean to cough up its CO2 when the SUN and ORBIT makes things a little hotter so there is a LAG in not a LEAD by CO2. 5) Yes, but you didn't mention where is that ice equilibrium with global temp. and how much  ice would melt before that. You didn't factor in strongest positive feedbacks I mentioned in 4). I said a little that is my best level of predictive confidence. 6) Got to give you that one, people will not listen about the consequences before. 7) False, prediction based entirely on feelings on how this plays out.

The ""ice age"" talk that is going around now (scientisis never said imminent ice age, or even cooling btw) is entirely based on predictions that sun's activity will continue to fall. However, media doesn't factor in greenhouse gases and their effect on countering the cooling effect. Nonsense - the sun has dropped recently and its not showing in the most used temp graph = why I do not trust the graph (from lairs with so much on the line) but satellite (not usually viewed or sourced ) is showing cooling and some global ice has returned.  10) Only problem is that you cherrypick data from science, try to disprove it with all your heart and then call it the force driving mankind. It is not counted as pseudoscience for a reason. If you set conspiracy theories aside for a moment, you would understand.﻿ I have a long love affair with science.  I do not believe in one single conspiracy theory NONE.  Not only did I never think Obozo was born in Kenya but I did not even care = it just means we elected a Kenyan to the presidency.  When younger I was a little troubled by the circumstance of JFK but after checking Warren has it correct.",UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Hansen claimed that parts of Manhattan would be under water for several years by 2015.  He made claims about state of emergency and need for increases in police and nation guard.  Hansen's predictions in 1988 just so happened to coincide with the short 20 to 25 year span where anthropogenic CO2 emissions were going up fast and temperature was also going up.  Other than this short span there is zero relationship between anthopogenic emissions and warmer temp going back to the late 19th century.  In fact absent this short over lap the relation is closer to inverse.  Despite this He still was wayyyyy off.  Yes if you use his most modest estimate he was still off significantly but the modest estimate was not the one he sold.  If you use the modest estimate of a 3 degree increase for every doubling of CO2 = it is based on a + feedback and there is no evidence to support this model.  Common sense as 1965 has been explaining to you rules it out with near 100% certainty.  Life would not be here if such + mechanisms were in place.  However now there is substantial experimental evidence invalidating these + feed backs.  For one thing the warming model predicts the trop hot spot which doesn't exist.  Also the warmer model (and this is huge) predicts that the earth will radiate less heat into space as CO2 and temp increase. Well unfortunately for the warmers we now can test this and as it turns out the earth emits more heat into space as more CO2 has been emitted.  If we apply the 3 degree every 2X model - then Hansen's most modest model applied to the past 17 years would not even be close or the 17 years before 1970 or the 17 before that or before that and before that extending =some 3.5 billion I guess. When Hansen received the balloon data about arctic temps he said ""there should be an increase (in temp) - the fact that the data shows no increase leads me to conclude the DATA is wrong - when the satellite data arrived covering the same scope it was a near perfect correlation with the balloon data.  Hansen's temp record has evolved conveniently.  In his early chart the temps of the 1940s were higher and the 1980s were lower - now his revised chart has flipped them = this in not the first attempt warmers made to change their model to global past cooling instead of global future warming.  Mann's hockey stick prediction is gone and never claimed by warmers and now only discussed by warmers as an obfuscation against legitimate attacks.  Mann's trick was used to ""hide the decline"" by UEA. I think you would be quite safe to go with my predictions and dump Gore, Hansen, Mann, UEA and the rest of the warmers.",UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

There is only a finite amount of fossil fuel.  The sooner we burn it the sooner we will max out our CO2 emission capacity.  Remember the CO2 is quickly removed from the atm so as for human contribution only the last 15 really 10 years matter.  The sooner we max out our CO2 emission capacity the less we can drive up CO2 in the atm.  This means that the more ff  we burn now the less we will be able to perturb the climate when we have the population and industry to make a dent.  That means if we drive SUVs now we will produce less warming when it matters = later.,UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Now the ice is back and the storms are gone, not to mention that the temperature has remained flat for 18 years (like the earth from your climate model = why we are in jeopardy of falling off) despite near exponential increase in CO2 anthropogenic emissions.  Could fresh water melt off cause an expansion of ice coverage - maybe IDK and I bet no one else does either.  However, we were told by the climate catastrophe prognosticators that the ice would be gone by now - how does that square with fresh water melt = it doesn't.  Not only that but we were told that the loss of ice coverage was just one example of the positive feed-backs (unsubstantiated hypothesized feed backs or more accurately highly discredited by the observed evidence feed backs) because ice reflects heat back into space.  The tiny 3.5% fraction of gas emitted by man which in totality is only 3.5% of the GH was going to melt the ice (which was not suppose to refreeze) and the loss of AREA ice would alter the earth's alberto = less heat reflected into space.  But what do you know even in the warmers ever metamorphosing model (which is supposed to be settled) the earth has a NEGATIVE ice feedback mechanism with respect to warming. Now I read that one of the terrible privations of warming was going to be more intense and horrific weather and storms is no longer predicted.  Now the warmth will occur faster at the poles and slower at the equator.  It is the disparity between the two which drives these powerful storms so warming will now reduce the incidence and severity of hurricanes and tornadoes = wrong again warmers.  This makes one wonder if some additional warmth will not make the world a much better place. Of course none of this has anything to do with or in any way justifies - a multi trillion dollar renewable slush fund for despots raised with the revenue from a carbon tax.  Wake up LITTLE LAMB!",UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Related Articles Attribution of recent climate change Global warming Greenhouse effect Sulfur hexafluoride Temperature record of the past 1000 years Climate change mitigation A study in the July 2002 issue of Journal of Geophysical Research-Space Physics, published by the American Geophysical Union, proposes for the first time that interstellar cosmic rays could be the missing link between the discordant temperatures observed during the last two decades (since recorded satellite records began in 1979). The report, by Fangqun Yu of the State University of New York-Albany, proposes that the rays, tiny charged particles that bombard all planets with varying frequency depending on solar wind intensity, may have height-dependent effects on our planet's cloudiness. Previous research has proposed a link between cosmic rays and cloud cover, has not suggested the altitude dependence of the current study. ""A systematic change in global cloud cover will change the atmospheric heating profile,"" Yu said. ""In other words, the cosmic ray-induced global cloud changes could be the long-sought mechanism connecting solar and climate variability."" The hypothesis, if confirmed, could also shed light on the Sun's role in global warming. The amount of cosmic rays reaching Earth depends on solar winds, which vary in strength by space-weather conditions. Yu points out that indications of Earth's warming have coincided with decreased cosmic ray intensity during the 20th century.

Also there is no experimental evidence to support the model of all extra pCO2 in earth atm is a result of man's emissions.  At least the notion/hypothesis that as we (humans) put CO2 into the atm so atm pCO2 increases is not on it face STUPID like the feedback amplifier which flies directly in the face on common sense .  However, this model was not adopted due to experimental success - only by default from the alleged inability to find another cause for the heating (exaggerated heating) and increase pCO2.  We now have a much better model that explains the climate and it has ZERO to do with man and industry. As it turns out man's extra 3.8% emissions is partially or mostly removed by natural means.  In fact atm CO2 increases more in response to heat than as a effectuator of heat.  Also, it is likely that as pCO2 increases it will become increasingly difficult to cause it to continue to rise due to the damping effect of the concentration gradient and diffusion.

(Since then a really good explanation of the cause has been found and it has nothing to do with CO2 at all - let alone man's tiny contribution.) 5) They could not make any CO2 climate model work via the known insulating effect of CO2.  A bazaar model was fabricated.  (Maybe this crazy model explained some portion of the temperature record going backwards - I do not know.)  The model on which all AGCC is based pertains to a hypthesized amplified effect of the KNOWN insulating properties of CO2.  Acording to the AGCC model for every 2x increase in atm pCO2 the known insulating effect which predicts a 1.1 degree increase in global temperatur there will actually be a 3x effect or 3.3 degree increase in global temperature due to a perturbation.  In the AGCC model - warmer temperature from pCO2  will cause more water to evaporate (water vapor is about 95% of the greenhouse) which will cause more heat - which will cause more water to evaporate - which will cause more heat and on and on.  Several metrics were established by climate science to test the validity of the pathetically weak hypothesis of the amplified CO2 greenhouse.  Two very important metrics were - the formation of a tropospheric hot spot near the equator and a reduced amount of radiant heat from the earth into space as the temperature increased and the greenhouse intensifies from higher pCO2.  The warmers were part of the development of these metrics  to validate or invalidate their hypothesis.  Since the fabrication of the AGCC hypothesis and the predetermined outcome measures - there has been no hot spot found as predicted (You and I are not qualified to know the importance or lack of importance of the hot spot relative to AGCC - but I an intelligent enough to know that it is really bad to choose a predetermined metric of validation then discard it when it INVALIDATES - that smells like snake oil.) and the earth has been proven to radiate more heat as temperature increases and less heat as temperature falls (who would have thought). As it turns out pCO2 is unrelated to earths radiant heat signature - and since we are in a general warming trend (not lately) and pCO2 is high - pCO2 has a loose inverse relationship as the one predicted by the AGCC model.      More to come on the religion of Anthropogenic Global Climate Change",UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

There were some scientists that were continuing Suess's work about the potential that man's activity may reduce the negative effects of cooling and possibly cause heating.  At some point in the 80s there was a strike of coal miners in the UK - also OPEC was controlling the flow of oil to the world.  Thatcher wanted to pursue alternatives to oil and coal and was pushing hard for nukes - she liked the idea that burning fossil fuel was a problem so nukes was an answer.  She increased funding to climate science and wanted proof of the greenhouse crisis.  A bureaucrat at UN named Strong was a big proponent of one world order.  The unlikely pair of Strong and Thatcher got the IPCC started for completely different motives.  At this time Al Gore was pushing the same thing in the USA.  When the wall fell and communism was exposed many from that faction were in search of a new anti capitalist platform.  Crazy environmentalists also were drawn to the idea of attacking development and big business.  (Did you know that GW and AGCC has caused so much hardship, suffering, and death, in Africa and the 3rd world - because they push to prevent development there and stop oil drilling and coal mining and more - like the ethanol caused food shortage?) Money stared to flow and environmental science started to grow.  Politicians, researchers, bureaucrats, environmentalists, alternative energy entrepreneurs, and more all had a huge vested interest in this coalescence of faction which made for the strangest of bedfellows.

Three themes are emerging from the newly released emails: (1) prominent scientists central to the global warming debate are taking measures to conceal rather than disseminate underlying data and discussions; (2) these scientists view global warming as a political “cause” rather than a balanced scientific inquiry and (3) many of these scientists frankly admit to each other that much of the science is weak and dependent on deliberate manipulation of facts and data. Regarding scientific transparency, a defining characteristic of science is the open sharing of scientific data, theories and procedures so that independent parties, and especially skeptics of a particular theory or hypothesis, can replicate and validate asserted experiments or observations. Emails between Climategate scientists, however, show a concerted effort to hide rather than disseminate underlying evidence and procedures. “I’ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI [Freedom of Information] Acts. One way to cover yourself and all those working in AR5 would be to delete all emails at the end of the process,”writes Phil Jones, a scientist working with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a newly released email. “Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden,” Jones writes in another newly released email. “I’ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.” The original Climategate emails contained similar evidence of destroying information and data that the public would naturally assume would be available according to freedom of information principles. “Mike, can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith [Briffa] re AR4 [UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment]?” Jones wrote to Penn State University scientist Michael Mann in an email released in Climategate 1.0. “Keith will do likewise. … We will be getting Caspar [Ammann] to do likewise. I see that CA [the Climate Audit Web site] claim they discovered the 1945 problem in the Nature paper!!” The new emails also reveal the scientists’ attempts to politicize the debate and advance predetermined outcomes. “The trick may be to decide on the main message and use that to guid[e] what’s included and what is left out” of IPCC reports, writes Jonathan Overpeck, coordinating lead author for the IPCC’s most recent climate assessment.",UCIdOk2-jZ23HJDdE3bTDX7Q,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

And only you guys can see it, while everyone else is just too blind, right? So who is organising and spreading this disinformation? The scientists? The politicians? The corporate interests? All of them together? It's all so confusing. Oh, I know all about the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine petition; apart from the fact that that seemingly large number of signatories only represents a tiny fraction of overall scientists, it is also dominated by scientists in fields unrelated to climate research, which reduces the credibility of their complaint, as expertise in one field does not automatically translate into others. Also, similar signature projects have been done for 'thousands' of scientists dissenting 'Darwinism' - utterly meaningless for science (especially ironic because deniers always complain that 'consensus' is an argument from popularity), and just once again shows how ideology can easily trump reality. Global warming is not big business when compared to fossil fuels, not by a long shot. And all the astroturfing is sponsored by these old industries. You'd think if GW was so much more profitable, then these companies would switch over in a blink. In fact, in many countries scientists are now either implicitly or explicitly told to not discuss global warming. Personally, and hearing from colleagues I can confirm this; that scientists and organisations are afraid to make statements in support of AGW science because there is a high chance they will get their funding cut by boards and politicians stacked with AGW deniers. I know to the public it seems the opposite, but in reality there is a huge amount of pushback against climate science at the moment, and has been increasingly happening for almost a decade now. But even without that, no scientist personally profits from pushing the AGW 'hoax', grants do not go into their pockets, and the bulk of funding goes to expensive items like putting monitoring satellites in space.",UC1BgCg8DAXlkqVDRcBbYQ1A,1,Ughjpb_jT6kMM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

China, India, Russia, and other nations that will never cooperate are now well over 1/2 of the man-made CO2. This leaves potentially cooperative nations about 1.6% of yearly CO2 emissions. Cutting this by 20% would send all involved economies into recession or depression. 20% of 1.6% = about .3% This .3% reduction in yearly total CO2 emissions is the totality of what in the best case scenario is possible to cut.  Even if we were willing to suffer such economic hardship - China and other shady characters would be in a position of greater power. The most effective way to achieve this .3% reduction in CO2 (remember all CO2 represents only 3.5% of the greenhouse) is to develop nuclear power which emits no greenhouse gas and in the USA has an excellent safety record. If the AGCC people would get behind nukes instead of blocking nukes - greenhouse gas emissions would be cut and the economy would improve significantly and China would not be elevated in power.

At some point in our universe, there is going to be no consciouss being and at that point, time is going to vanish, the same as colors, sounds, feelings, everything that you understand as reality. What you do, what you write, what you think, is just a fraction of infinity and a fraction of infinity is compared nothing to infinity. So, you are an agnostic. Well, I think it's ridicilous to even consider the existence of god. Agnostics are very special, they do not believe in god because they know nothing about it, but they don't denie him because they know nothing about him. It's for me personally a very weak trait, because you are not able to use your own reasoning to actually understand that the existence of an almighty being is purely impossible by concept. It's like saying there is a round, straight line that is 4 dimensional. It makes no sense. Ofcourse you know nothing about a round, straight line that is 4 dimensional, because you cannot denie it exists. But it doesn't because the concept is impossible, atleast to the reason that was given to us by natural laws. I don't know anything about you, but most agnostic know that if god or a life after death does not exist, life as absolutly meaningless. You agnostics need the doubt, the hope, to keep going. It's a basic weakness of a human being, the urge for meaning. ""Why does the universe exist?"" There is no why to reality, it just exists, there is no beginning of existance, the same as there is no time. It's not a philosphy, it's pure realism.

Case in point: scientists have always known they need to adjust raw data from weather station to account for factors like local heat sources. Ironically, the deniers then complain that they don't use the raw data but perform some 'random' manipulation of the 'pure' data. Can't win.

It is therefore also uncontroversial that a doubling of that level will warm the planet more - by how much is a matter of debate, but it looks like it will be well above 1degreeC, probably closer to 3. The warming trend of the past 50 years at least is most likely 100% due to human influence, as all the natural factors have been neutral or cooling.

There are no unknown factors that haven't been discovered and, 2. they know more about every other factor than they do about CO2.

The more sunlight gets reflected the less heat gets in. Now everything that is hot radiates electromagnetic waves, the hotter the higher the frequency. The earth mostly radiates infrared waves and this is the outgoing radiation. (The sun is hotter -> higher frequencys) So you have incoming heat in the high frequency spectrum. And outgoing heat in the low frequency spectrum. So there is a balance. Now CO2 absorbs outgoing low frequency radiation that normaly gets through without a problem. If this radiation gets blocked by the CO2 the heat stays in. That is the greenhouse effect. If the same amount comes in but less goes out the heat increases. And you can actually prove that CO2 absorbs low freqency electromagnetic waves. And it is proven. It is a little simplified (I left out radiation windows) but it will do. Does it matter? - 1-2°C maybe doesn't sound like much but it is the average! Climate change also means that temperature differences become more extreme. Why? Because at the equator more radiation is incoming - so less outgoing radiation makes a bigger difference there. While the difference is smaller in colder areas. Extremer temperatures are bad alone. - But higher temperature differences also cause winds (which are basically heat exchanger) to get stronger. Say hello, to stronger hurricans americans! - And the change of the climate disrupts a lot of balanced water/air circuits. There are some reasonable theorys that the gulfstream might be stopped because of that. (I won't explain that because I am not an expert and I may explain something wrong. But it has something to do with the sinking of the water of the gulfstream in the north, being affected by the melting of the ice). This would cause the temperature in Europe to drastically sink. It would be as cold as Canada basically. And Europe is a high density and fertile region right now. - The rise of the sea levels will flood a lot of low regions and cause migration movements. So sounds like a lot of fun. I don't think that humanity will be wiped from earth because of that. We will survive somehow. Especially the rich and high developed countries.

You and I will often conclude that something is credible, but reserve our position and not commit ourselves to an idea.  And we all change our minds - we may initially adopt one position, only to have it changed when other information comes along. I have always had a strong sense of environmental responsibility and principles, and I try to live my life that way.  When the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect came along, I was concerned. And I was honestly shocked when the IPCC publicised the ""hockey stick"".  At that time, I was constantly being told this was perhaps THE major issue facing mankind and so I decided it was something I should try to understand in detail. So I looked into it and found that the rhetoric was not backed-up with convincing evidence or physical arguments. Therefore I COULDN'T go with it, and I came to the conclusion that the pounding doomsaying was an abuse of science (because it claims to be science - as you do). You contend that I deny ""the science"", but this is vague and you are being lazy again. You need to explain exactly what I am supposed to be denying, and tell me why I have no right to have a reasoned alternative point of view on such a point.

They claim to have an answer and suggest the unscientific precautionary principle as a way to justify not putting it to the test. Lysenko always had quick answers to new problems and his ideas always moved-on too quickly for the patient work of scientific enquiry to conclude. I see exactly the same thing happening with Climacatastrophology because they have prescribed a fix (which suits an ideology) and their explanation of the underlying issue keeps blowing in the wind as new information comes to light.  So the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect (which was specific and predicted temperature rise) is found to have no evidence (no hotspot and its central prediction of CO2-induced temperature rise doesn't happen when CO2 concentration is at its highest).  The story then moves onto ""climate change"" and CO2 is somehow blamed for every bad weather event in the world?  Can you spot any gaps in CO2  making the weather go mad while there is no warming?  In the overall scheme of things, it is hard to argue that Climatastrophology has been starved of resources when Governments have spent $billions on it for no obvious positive conclusion.  Australia has just stated that it will not be funding the gravy train, and Climacatastrophologers will need to go private for their funding. They will have nothing to worry about if people like you step-in and back your beliefs with the money in your own pocket. If you are not prepared to do that, then you seal their fate and it shows how little commitment you have to (ahem) ""the Cause"".

And I have seen comparisons using the gas laws. But nothing which particularly challenges the greenhouse effect. Returning to the omens of Climacatastrophology, Climate Sensitivity is a central issue.  This focuses on the incremental effect of increasing pCO2.  Beer's Law tells us that the slope of Climate Sensitivity should reduce for increasing pCO2, and a logarithmic response is expected.  Starting from pre-industrial pCO2, Beer's Law suggests Climate Sensitivity should be quite small. Perhaps less than 1 degC/doubling pCO2. This isn't particularly controversial and I would be surprised if you wanted to debate this. But Climacatastropohology cannot exist with low Climate Sensitivity.

But global ice cover anomaly is about +1 million square kilometres and is evidence of a compensating feedback which constrains Climate Sensitivity, rather than amplifies it. Climate Sensitivity could easily be small  and the longer the ""Pause"" continues, the more likely the evidence will support low Climate Sensitivity.  It couldn't be any other way if there has been no temperature rise for 15 years, just when pCO2 reaches higher values than recent history. If further evidence was required, climate modelling by Santer et al anticipated a tropospheric hotspot pattern for the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect. This  including arguments about amplification.  He went looking for it (specifically the ""vertical amplification"" = temperature aloft in the tropics should be higher than at the surface) and reported that it wasn't observed.  According to the scientific method, this is called falsification by data. And it doesn't look like anybody is likely to change Santer's conclusions anytime soon. There hasn't been any surface warming for 15 years and there hasn't been any warming aloft in the predicted hotspot zone. Without the supporting evidence of the predicted hotspot pattern of the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect, NONE of the recent warming can be attributed to the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect.  This is a dead parrot. So what is all the fuss about?  Why have we been hearing the wailings of the Climacatastrophologers about ""x-years-to-save-this-and-that"" for years now? That's why I compared it to homeopathy and theology.  I agree that there is no scientific merit in either of these because the central premise of each cannot be supported by evidence and data. The same is true of Climacatstrophology predictions of catastrophic temperature rise, amplification of Climate Sensitivity, loss of polar ice, and the hotspot (amongst other things).  I cannot think of a single prediction from Climacatastrophology which has been shown to be correct. And why resort to ad-hominem attack? Is the word ""denier"" something you need to use to help try to justify yourself?  Search for ""Lysenkoism"" to read about a case where junk science was propped up by attacking and denouncing opponents, rather than examining the evidence (there is a decent wiki on it). ",UCExGhjkRbKmPqX5S_-fcXig,1,UgjGTpj2CYnq7ngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

But there IS a consensus that they will rise, and do so significantly, a minimum of 1 or 2C. Yet many deniers tell us that there will be no rise, because apparently the greenhouse gas theory is bogus. Do you agree with the latter?!? There have been several 'pauses' over time (most recently the 50s and 60s), nobody is surprised that the temperature doesn't rise smoothly, and unless it actually starts cooling significantly, this 'pause' is not the problem it's being made out to be. Of course scientists are going to look for possible explanations for the 'pause', rather then instantly throwing their hands up and saying ""oh well, guess we were wrong"". No theory would ever survive that attitude. As long as the explanations do not break other science there is no problem in modifying a theory. It's happened numerous times with Evolution, and has strengthened it, while at the same time creationists accuse scientists that they are desperately propping up a failing theory even though it hadn't predicted a particular bit of data. Sound familiar? What an idiotic attempt at ""turning around the question"": I base my view on homeopathy on science that has been published, showing it does not and cannot work, while the practitioners are involved in biased self-deception. My acceptance of climate science is exactly the same. How come you have an insight into climate science that the practicing scientists don't? Or do you believe in the lunatic fringe conspiracy theories?!?",UC1BgCg8DAXlkqVDRcBbYQ1A,1,UgjGTpj2CYnq7ngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

And past predictions of rising temperature are now being seriously challenged by ""the Pause"", and the predicted tropospheric hotspot was never observed. There are numerous ideas coming forth to try to find new physical processes to reconcile past predictions of rising temperature with the Pause (such as ""the ocean ate my global warming""). However, these new attempts to embellish the supposedly infallible climate  models just help to demonstrate that past predictions were wrong and the model are fallible after all. It is an odd kind of consensus with all of the above going on.  But hey, you are entitled to your view. Therefore, to reflect your own question back:  how come you have an insight into the alleged fatal flaws of theology and homeopathy that thousands of practitioners have overlooked? It's not that I personally accept either theology or homeopathy (so don't go there), but you seem to expect others to respect your right to lay opinion on any range of matters, while you do not respect other opinions.

The solution was to have the people&#39;s farm animals rotate where they would graze frequently (essentially) so now it&#39;s possible that the Sahara desert might not even be a desert after some decades (or something like that- go watch the video for yourself! It&#39;s truly fascinating!).<br />    I really hope that people start to realize that a carbon tax isn&#39;t the best answer, nor the only answer out there.  And that it actually might be quite a bad one.  Keep in mind that most of these laws and ideas like the carbon tax come from politicians that are using the law to get <b>votes</b> NOT because it&#39;s necessarily a GOOD idea.",UCLmPNl1TRhATiXifBsvBGbw,0,Ugi8fmVMqavCfXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The catastrophizing of the situation by many &quot;scientists&quot; is very alarming to me, and much more so than the ignorance of the public. Why? Because it is malignantly dishonest. The truth is somewhere in the middle, yes humans are affecting the global temperature of the world, and yes it will have some negative (and also positive, look up the legitimate scientific studies by climatologists) effects. Overall I believe the net effect will be negative, but it is certainly not the &quot;armageddon&quot; that this video and others try to make it out to be. That is just a baseless prediction with no empirical reasoning behind it, just a faith in models that aren&#39;t very soundproof. The basis of science is empiricism. And you must not only look at this issue from a scientific perspective, but also a cost-benefit analysis perspective.

Not sure if somebody has answered your question about why Australia repealed it&#39;s carbon tax.<br /><br />The new Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbot (I say new, but he was elected about a year ago) was opposed to the &quot;Carbon Tax&quot; when past Prime Minister Julia Gillard first proposed it since she had originally said that she wouldn&#39;t, Abbot considered it a breach of the trust of the Australian people, and used to it prop up his attack-dog tactics that resulted in him winning the election. Abbot made a big fuss about how much the carbon price would affect families and regular people day to day life, claiming that annual expenses would increase everywhere, even down to the weekly groceries. He called it the &quot;The big new tax&quot; or something like that, and made it his key election promise that he would remove the carbon tax if he was elected to office.<br />That is how it happened in the public&#39;s eye, but the reasons behind repealing the carbon price was not the attempt to make good on Julia Gillard&#39;s promise she made 5 years ago, but it&#39;s because Australia&#39;s biggest exports are Iron Ore and Coal. Both are heavily polluting industries that were hit fairly hard by the carbon tax, The mining industry in Western Australia was the major factor in keeping Australia from going into recession along with the rest of the world in the GFC (the then-government&#39;s &quot;stimulus package&quot; also played a role). Essentially, due to the global economy still being shaky, and Australia having a less-than-perfect economy currently, Tony Abbot didn&#39;t want to do anything that would hold back our biggest industries.<br /><br />I hope that clarifies things (tried to be as impartial as possible), from a fellow Physics nerd ;)",UCvhsceN7dIHaZ-I2D3sxMnA,0,Uggmcf-kzQQ5fHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

They are so sheltered by wealth that they will never have to deal with climate change as poor and geographically exposed populations do.  What makes me angry is that in the U.S we have the highest net energy consumption, higher than china and India combined.

This would be a bad thing because without the ozone layer to absorb it, the sun's UV light would kill life on the Earth's surface. This problem was at least halted by international agreement to ban these substances. Yay, we can cooperate to solve environmental threats!This is a fairly common confusion. They are completely separate issues, but both involve emissions of gases and something to do with sunlight and people tend to vague out at that point.The bit about recycling probably wasn't the best considered wording. Recycling does to some extent reduce CO2 emissions by reducing the energy spent producing new materials. But it's not the first thing you think of for reducing CO2. The first port of call is reducing energy usage by increasing efficiency and just plain old not wasting it.The last bit of interview was about ""reputable sources"" disagreeing about whether global warming is a problem. The reality is that almost all relevant experts agree that global warming is a problem and that it is at least mostly caused by us. The apparent disagreement people see, is coming from vested interests that stand to lose out if we cut fossil fuel use.

What effects our environment effects us. <br />How do we get rid of this cheap, abundant, and addictive substance that our cars need to get us from point A to B? We use something else; i.e. algae, solar panels, wind power, ethanol, hydrogen, steam, &quot;clean coal&quot;. If it&#39;s not petroleum, then it&#39;s okay. -though, logically that&#39;s stupid. We&#39;ll get to that later.<br />The real answer is Electricity. Did you know that Edison had an electric car in 1901? Did you also know that people were converting combustion car engines to use hydrogen in the 1970s? The technology exists...but no one bought into it because it wasn&#39;t cost effective. Now...we&#39;re running out of oil....so we need an energy race to find the thing that will replace our energy needs. <br />How do we do this? We motivate people to coming up with more ideas...cheaper ideas. The cheaper it is, the more people will buy into it. -And that&#39;s a great thing. As you see, electricity is the most abundant energy source in the universe. Solar Flares that come into contact with the Earth&#39;s outer atmosphere wreak havoc on communications satellites, analog phone lines, radio communications, etc. Why? Because it is an electrical phenomena. &quot;When air or gas is ionized, plasma forms with conductive properties similar to those of metals. Plasma is the most abundant form of matter in the Universe, because most stars are in a plasma state.&quot; ...&quot;Ionization is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons to form ions.&quot;<br />There you have it. The most abundant form of matter in the universe is essentially ionized gas. Gas with a positive or negative electrical charge.<br />Now, if we are to advance as a civilization and a species, the next phase in our evolution is energy mastery and efficiency. If we can utilize all of the energy that gets used, and re-use it, then we will cease to have any energy woes. Clean energy exists all around us....but we only came upon this energy revolution AFTER Global Warming/Climate Change was presented to us as a real threat.<br />I for one, believe that it is real, but that it is greatly exaggerated, and not fully understood, as scientists always seem to have to chase their tale when their climate predictions fail to be as terrible as predicted, or when the global climate temperature holds steady for over a decade. I digress. <br />What I am happy about, is that this has brought about a race that is just as important, if not more so, than our race to the Moon in the 60s. <br />This is something that the whole world will benefit from. It will make us more efficient, less dependent, more free, healthier, wealthier, and wiser. ...and sure, while we&#39;re at it, we can make ourselves feel better for saving the planet. :)<br /><br />So...when people come up to me, and start talking about how &quot;the global climate hasn&#39;t had this much CO2 in the atmosphere in 650,000 years&quot;, my question to them is always, Well how did it get so high 650,000 years ago without cars or factories? And also why are you standing around trying to get people hear your words and believe in your cause instead of using your ingenuity and creativity to tell people about a new means of recycling materials, recycling energy, storing energy more efficiently, etc, etc. Stop professing...start building.

Whether your apparent facts are true or not is irrelevant. The climate has changed. It&#39;s got warmer. And CO2 is a major role in the temperature rise. The amount of CO2 already in the atmosphere would take around 1000 years naturally to reduce to the levels before we intervened. These are facts everyone agrees on. Is it not common sense to be safe rather than sorry? After all technology has already proved we don&#39;t need to use as much CO2 as we currently are due to break throughs in renewable energy etc. it&#39;s clear to anyone with a brain to see that these corporate oil companies are sugar coating all the facts.

For the sun to be driving the change it would have had to put out more energy than it had been. To do that it would have to get hotter or bigger (or both). Well to get hotter it would have had to shrink (that's how stars work) and the shrinking out weighs the hotter, so that's not what could have happened if it's going to put out the needed extra energy. To get bigger, well it would have got cooler, but being bigger it would put out more energy (again, that's just how stars work). Thing is that we know how big the Sun is and we know how big it's been in history to a high accuracy. By sheer co-incidence the sun and moon look about the same size as viewed from earth.

However 96 was an exceptionally warm el niño year. Also that data set doesn’t include satellite data. Furthermore it is a badly drawn trend line on most representations of that data set. It shows a tiny portion of the available data and ridiculous to include such a small number of year when trying to demonstrate a relatively long term trend. Something like 15 of the hottest 16 years have been during this century. In terms of the Ice caps it does appear as though there has been a 40% increase in the last two years however that is a tiny upward fluctuation at the end of a long downward trend. It still leaves ice cap levels far below there former levels. Also it is less to do with the amount of CO2 released but more to do with the unbalancing of CO2 in natural eco systems.

Also, where do you get that .1%? Are you just pulling that out of your ass? Because .1% is 1000ppm. The current concentration of co2 in the atmosphere is 410ppm on average. So climate scientists want to almost triple the concentration? Also, mans addition to the amount of oxygen is relatively small, if you compare it to, for example, to the amount of co2 the ocean naturally releases. The thing is, that amount of co2, under normal conditions is absorbed back from the atmosphere. Mans addition just means there’s more co2 being added to the atmosphere than is being absorbed back. I honestly don’t care if people make money from global warming or alternative energies, thing is the greenhouse effect IS real (and although it occurs naturally and is very important to the regulation of the temperature on earth, it is being magnified by humans, and if you don’t think this is a real danger just google Venus ‘s atmosphere), and humans ARE contributing to it significantly enough to warm the planet up by a few degrees Celsius in the long run.",UCBwS2A6ROmboToYn6Asipxw,1,Ugh89VxV_iG3w3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Dont get me wrong, carbon taxing seems like a way forward, but the implementation in some cases simply doesn&#39;t work because the law doesn&#39;t fit all scenarios right out of the gate. Speaking of Quantas: there is no other way to transport people from and to Australia by plane that uses less/no carbon, so the tax was ultimately killing the company and also setting up a scenario in which no airline would survive in the country. On the other hand, if the government had an incentive programme to help their airlines change to a newer fleet (which is much more fuel efficient that a lot of planes in the air right now), carbon release would be lowered anyway.",UCAJIvIzE3ImZl1PczSs67QQ,0,UgikyDMbN_9XMXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Climate change is boring, as are all politicized, self-serving ideologies incubated by would-be control freaks. The political agenda behind (and largely funding) the propagation of climate change pseudo-science is monstrous in its over-the-top power-grabbing and lust for draconian social re-engineering. If the Salem witch-burners were alive today, they would be climate change ""scientists."" It's the same social dynamic in operation. Self-aggrandizement by a would-be priest class through the conjuring up of fears of evils in our midst that only they can see and rectify in order to garner for themselves undeserved respect, deference and social status. Whether witch-burners know that there are, in fact, no witches, and purposely deceive others or merely deceive themselves into sincerely believing that witches exist because it is in their self-interest for them to exist and then unknowingly deceive others, it makes no difference to those subjected to their claims of authority, who get burned either way. What undermines the credibility of your video is your pretense that those who disagree with or question the claims of climate-change-doomsayers are only the uninformed ""man on the street"" interviewees that you presented. Why not interview instead the leading dissenters in the scientific community itself? Did you follow at all the climate-change data-fixing scandal that broke in the UK several years ago? Your argument that the truth of your claim is confirmed by the fact that your mob is presently bigger in size than its opposition is the sort of gang-think so typical in politics, yet inimical to scientific advancement, as the history of science attests. Every great scientific advance begins with a minority dissenting from the hidebound (but often politically favored) views of the majority, which then must be overcome for knowledge to increase. In other words, the very unscientific tenor and tone of your video undermines its claim to present true science. It is self-indicting. And your supreme self-confidence in your follow-on answer to your critics doesn't help. You appear to be blinded to the science-based arguments from the other side. Your claims would be more convincing if you honestly presented the case against man-made climate change made in the scientific community and took them on head-on instead of pretending that the argument is between the scientific community on the one side and the ignorant and unwashed on the other. This debate is within science and it is the arguments of other scientists that you must vanquish to be credible, not straw men. Sorry, but for all these reasons, you have failed to convince me that man eclipses solar and geological forces as the prime driver of climate change, or that draconian social re-engineering will make any difference in our climate that is worth the damage to human life on this planet that will inevitably result from installing a new priest class that subordinates every other human value and interest to their peculiar (and conveniently self-serving) obsession.",UCQsUe94rnTHbCHfrGnYJjdw,1,Ugg4f080haIMb3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

It does not matter who causes the change.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY!<br /><br /> It matters what we do with our lifes and how we raise new genrations. I cycle to work (I do have driving licence for car  and bike), bought recently 30 energy saving bulbs for new house (thats like 3 months of energy bills spendings here), thinking about solar power (loan probably as I&#39;m not rich), have bins for recyclables, never litter, would have an electric car (if i needed one)  etc.<br /><br />Sure I wont save the world. But I live my life trying to harm the environment less and less. And I hope my kids will follow, seeing me, and way I act. And maybe in the future they will be in more powerful postions to pass the legislations, or direct companies that can influence countries, not just local communieties. Not because they look for opportunity to profit, but becuase, we are capable of being modern society, and do things in better, alternative way. The more people will follow this  -the more % of next population will be aware. This will also make technology more affordable.<br /><br />I don&#39;t believe in man made global change as it is presented currently (in the 90s we had 9 planets - now we have 8 - and 600 years ago we just started to believe Earth is round - science skepticism - scientists are aslo humans who make errors). It does not mean I don&#39;t feel responible for planet Earth. Instead of agruing semantics online for several hours I would encourage both sides to do something &#39;green&#39; - not to prove who is right. But because we can! And if we can - then give me argument why not? Do your small bit, raise kids right way, and in 50-70 years you will have 80% of population thinking eco-friendly. <br /><br /><br /> (chances are if you have time to argue on YT about the Climate Change you are noone important (on global scale - you are important to your friends and family) and this won&#39;t change any time soon (i will be pushing buttons in the office for the rest of my days probably).

A carbon tax doesn&#39;t seem to be a solution. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s creating an alternative energy source. It&#39;s just costing you more to continue using the amount of carbon you&#39;ve become accustomed to. <br />Rather than running to the government every time there&#39;s a problem in business and telling them to fix it, people should just use the power of being a consumer. If you don&#39;t like Mcdonalds because it&#39;s not healthy or ethical, then STOP eating it. They are a business, they are here for ONE thing, your money. And if they aren&#39;t getting it then they will either adapt to the changes you want or go out of business. <br />If we want to see changes in carbon consumption in energy then first we need someone to take a risk and implement a better system. And yes I am aware that new systems are in place and growing. As consumers of that energy, every user who makes the switch is a vote against the alternative. Those coal plants will either adapt to the changes or die. <br />I mean, you have basic evolution happening everyday in the free market and the &quot;scientists&quot; keep asking a god figure (government) to step in and sort it all out. <br />Seems a little ironic. <br />People don&#39;t like parent states. It&#39;s hard to trust governments who commonly use taxation and tax breaks as incentives to use current technology that lobbyist push for their own agendas. Educating the consumer is the best way to win the war. As consumers we can be more powerful than the government and get actual changes made faster without all the bureaucratic red tape.

2246,UgjGr_nZOY9EdngCoAEC,5.0,28,2014-09-10 04:51:23,isodoublet,"Derek, I generally like your videos a lot, but there are a lot of problems with this one.<br /><br />First, the scientific &quot;consensus&quot; has been severely misrepresented. So, <b>what</b> do 97% of climate scientists agree on, exactly? Two assertions:<br />1. Temperatures have generally risen over the past 200 years<br />2. Human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures.<br /><br />Conspicuously absent from this is how big of a role humans played, and how this will continue in the future. That&#39;s right, it is not true that 97% of climate scientists agree that a carbon tax is a good idea (but more on that later).<br /><br />Second, the climate predictions you see publicized are based on computer models that ignore <b>crucial</b> features of climate dynamics, such as cloud cover and the role of chemistry and biology. These models are only validated from their ability to predict present data from past data, which is obvious because they were designed to reproduce the historical data in the first place. They are <b>not</b> validated to predict future data, not by a long shot. That&#39;s why you often hear numbers for climate sensitivity (the rise in temperature given a doubling of CO2 concentration -- it&#39;s logarithmic) that are, quite frankly, absurd. 10 degrees Celsius? Please. No evidence whatsoever suggests that, apart from what you get from a model -- the historical, <b>observed</b> climate sensitivity is closer to 1 degree. &quot;But climate is dominated by positive feedback loops&quot;, I hear you say. Well, if it were, we would already be at those higher temperatures, wouldn&#39;t we? Natural fluctuations would&#39;ve been enough to kick the system over to its fixed point. At the very least, fluctuations of similar amplitude as the predictions should have been observed; climate may not be as hectic as weather, but it is <b>still</b> chaotic in the precise definition of the term. <br /><br />Third, even assuming that it&#39;s true, asking people &quot;what are you doing about climate change&quot; is disingenuous because there&#39;s nothing that the average person CAN do. Any action has to be taken at the policy-making level. Walking to work and taking shorter showers is going to do diddly squat about it.<br /><br />Fourth, there are vested interests in both sides of this issue. If you think that Al Gore is doing advocacy for this out of the goodness of his heart you should be ashamed of your naiveté. There&#39;s a lot of money to be made in this, and you can see shills in both sides, just as you can see honest people in both sides. Attack the arguments, not the person making them.<br /><br />Fifth, those who stand to lose if a price is put on carbon are essentially all of us. What do you think, that oil companies are going to reduce their profit margins? Of course they&#39;re not, they&#39;re going to pass the increased costs to the consumer. All consumer products will suddenly become more expensive because of the now higher transportation overhead. The people who are impacted the most are of course the poor: the person who needs to buy fuel to keep warm in the winter (FYI, you might want to look at how many people have been dying of cold for that reason in the UK). The people who global warming advocates claim will be the most affected by climate change are also the ones most affected by climate change mitigation policies. The evil businessman in a suit? He&#39;ll manage. He always does.<br /><br />Sixth, climate change is <b>not</b> like Armageddon. Even if the direst predictions are confirmed. That&#39;s emotionally charged language, which I realize is somewhat the point of your video, but it&#39;s also extremely misleading. It sounds like you&#39;re saying that the Earth will become like Venus, which nobody believes, not even you.<br /><br />Seventh, if their direst predictions aren&#39;t realized, that is, if global warming continues with a climate sensitivity similar to the historical 1 kelvin, we&#39;re looking at an <b>improved</b> biosphere, where the good effects outweigh the bad. Seriously, it&#39;s on the last IPCC report.<br /><br />Eighth, I believe it&#39;s been made clear by now but it pays to reiterate <b>why</b> the carbon tax has been repealed. Policy makers realized it&#39;s bad for the economy. And remember, when it&#39;s bad for the economy, it&#39;s not bad for the mustache twirling businessman, it&#39;s bad for the average Joe. Here&#39;s a crazy thought: climate change disproportionately affects the poor, right? So instead of trying to mitigate climate change which will allegedly be Armageddon wrought upon us by all the technologies we depend on, how about we... reduce poverty? Oh, too radical, huh.<br /><br />I think that&#39;s it. Sponsored by your advice on your second channel -- &quot;Be hated&quot;, which I completely agree with.

Another confounding problem is people seem to think the popularity of, or ability to express an opinion carries some weight.  Many peoples views are also highly emotionally charged &amp; motivated.<br />I am a criminologist/forensic psychologist &amp; I see this constantly in the gun debate. One side says it&#39;s obvious or it&#39;s common sense &amp; say &quot;Look at Britain.&quot; They never reference a study that isolates the variable &amp; makes a before &amp; after comparison. They go on &quot;common sense&quot; or assume correlation means causation. <br />The other side does essentially the same thing. They present &quot;evidence&quot; that isn&#39;t scientifically valid and they use emotionally driven argunents. Both sides have their minds made up. Because of that and because of a generally poor understanding of scientific method they will look at some painfully obviously flawed &quot;study&quot; from the NRA or Brady Campaign &amp; use that to reinforce their beliefs.<br />One of my co-workers very eloquently said &quot;It&#39;s like watching monkeys throw S@#% at each other while they try to debate special relativity.&quot; <br />I think the climate situation suffers from the same general ignorance of science in the population overall as well as people holding emotionally driven beliefs. <br />I went to school for 10 years &amp; surrounded myself with other people that valued knowledge &amp; formed opinions based on scientific evidence &amp; studies. A social or &quot;soft&quot; science has more room for opinions but those opinions are still very much evidence based.  After I graduated I worked with highly educated people &amp; my patients were generally criminals. I was seeing the two extremes. The highly educated &amp; the inmate population in my state that has an average education level below the 8th grade. <br />Anyways, for a long time, I didn&#39;t have lots of interaction with the &quot;average&quot; person. My peer group was social scientists &amp; college types. I ended up drastically overestimating the scientific literacy of the general population. <br />I think you are doing the same thing I did. You are teaching physics to students eager to learn &amp; your peer group is other highly educated people that live by the scientific method. You overestimated the scientific literacy of the general population. <br />I think that is why it&#39;s so hard to make progress on climate issues. Much of the population just doesn&#39;t understand.

Now we have this out of the way, lets see the problems -<br /><br />First and foremost, over the years it has became a business and a propaganda machine.Govts. are not doing anything more than just a lip service. They talk about how global warming is bad and how people should use bicycles instead of their cars and then go and start handful of wars so some elite can make profit. People are justified to not believe in govt, because govt = bullshit.<br /><br />Alternate to fossil fuel is very cheap and very feasible, you don&#39;t need some sci-fi power source providing unlimited energy, we already have one. But what has been done to harness the power sun releases all the time? We are pretty much at the same place we were 15 years ago. Yeah solar cells are cheaper, but they are still very inefficient and the and manufacturing them and the batteries to store the power causes more harm to climate than any good. We can use locally produced Ethanol and bio diesel, but then politicians making shitload of money off oil imports/exports will lose all that money, so why would they do it?<br /><br />Developed countries love to point their finger at developing countries and say, &quot;Well look at them, they are burning coal and releasing all that CO2 in the air.. They should stop!!&quot; Nope! You can&#39;t ask any developing country to stop using coal as their electricity and industrial fuel, not without providing them with cheaper alternative. But they can&#39;t give all these country nuclear technology and material, we are left with nothing but just finger pointing blame game. <br /><br />Making electricity from Uranium is very expensive, because U235 virtually inseparable from U238, so to enrich the fuel, they use a very tedious and time consuming centrifuge technology. We could have switched to Thorium, but since Thorium cycle doesn&#39;t produce weapon grade Plutonium, research was cut short.<br /><br />So you see, there&#39;s all talk but no solution for global warming. Govts. have done jackshit to solve the problem. Everyone bicycling to work is not a solution. We solve problems produced by technology with better technology, we don&#39;t take a step back and say, &quot;Yeah, that solves it&quot;!! The solution to Y2K was not to stop using computers and going back to pen and paper calculation, it was to rectify the problem root with better programming.<br /><br />So any govt that is serious about providing a solution to global warming, will actually stop their lip service and bullshit and start funding massive research toward implementing alternative energy source that we have already found.  ",UCUM7Hm-CVcDpBWYNQlKpOVQ,0,UggkMWnYXBLy5XgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The 1930s was a hot decade in the US but it wasn't so globally. In fact thirteen of the fourteen hottest years on record occurred this century. So no the 1930s were not particularly hot and the last 10 years are definitely not part of a cooling trend. There are other indicators like arctic sea ice melting and land ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica, plus ocean temperature rises that confirm the planet is still warming. Getting accurate data about the planet is not easy. But satellites make it a lot easier. When you find that the satellite data agrees with the ground-based data, and the sea level rise and temperature increases fit with predictions for an atmosphere with more CO2, all the signals point to a warming Earth that we have caused. Hence why 97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused global warming is occurring.

No there hasn't been a cooling trend in the last 10 years. These are the lies that Dereck was talking about. The denial camp just makes things up. Whatever it wants. There's no need to wait to collect more data points to ""see if it's real"". There's no need for more than two data points to tell you everything you *must* know. How much energy is going in and how much is coming out. If there is more energy going in than coming out then the planet is heating up. That's *all* that's *needed*. We've made that measurement and the world is between 0.6 and 0.85 Watts out of balance. That's how much more heat energy is coming in than going out. The controversy is where the effects will be felt first, will they be irreversible and ""run away"" if we push the energy balance too far. The basic climate change idea is so simple you can check it yourself. Look up black body radiation. Work out for yourself what the temperature of the world would be without the greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere. Then think about what happens if you double, triple or quadruple one of them. (Hint: when you work out the temperature of the Earth as it is now, but without GHG, you should get a figure somewhat below zero C for the current albedo of the Earth. Then you should realise that it would be covered in ice. Re run the figures for an all white planet with an albedo of 0.9. You should get a figure between minus 60 C and minus 40 C. (depending on assumptions you make) The current CO2 is holding us 60-70 C higher than we would be without it. Then tell me that CO2 doesn't matter or that there are no tipping points or that we can double the level of CO2 without worrying) edit: converted from ""stream of consciousness into something vaguely readable.",UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA,1,UghKJsFGDkwCK3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Looks like they add about 1 degree C in the areas where they're densest. From the IPCC: ""Computations of radiative forcing by contrails have been done for fixed atmospheric temperatures in the North Atlantic flight corridor (Fortuin et al., 1995). Normalized to 100% contrail cover (as provided by 1-D models), these computations found a net forcing in the range of -30 to +60 W m-2 in summer and 10 to 60 W m-2 in winter. The negative forcing values apply to clouds that are much thicker than typical contrails. A radiative convective model used to simulate the climatic conditions of a mid-European region (Strauss et al., 1997) found a radiative flux change of almost 30 W m-2 at the tropopause for 100% contrail cover with 0.55-�m optical depth of 0.28, and a surface temperature increase on the order of 0.05 K for a 0.5% increase in current contrail cloud cover. With a 2-D radiative convective model, a 1 K increase was found in surface temperature over most of the Northern Hemisphere for an additional cirrus cover of 5% (Liou et al., 1990). The potential effects of contrails on global climate were simulated with a GCM that introduced additional cirrus cover with the same optical properties as natural cirrus in air traffic regions with large fuel consumption (Ponater et al., 1996). The induced temperature change was more than 1 K at the Earth's surface in Northern mid-latitudes for 5% additional cirrus cloud cover in the main traffic regions.""",UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA,1,UghkzJYaJ7Snm3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

No matter what country you are in the word from the government remains the same; that humans are the reason for climate change.<br />Let me ask you this. If there wasn&#39;t climate change before humans or our long distant cousins, why is there fossil evidence of tropical and even desert plants embedded with layers of Scottish rock and why is there further plant evidence of plants that thrive in the cold as far south as North Africa?<br />What about the scientific samples of ice taken from both the Arctic and Antarctic that show CO and CO2 and many other green house gases being well above the concentrations of today. Where have the (sometimes sudden) fluctuations within concentrations come from?<br />Yes there is a human influence on our Earth&#39;s climate, but scientists who support the natural cycle theory (again both human and natural climate change are still only theories) state that our influence in the past 150 years and the 150 years is estimated to be in the region of 0.000005%!<br /><br />There is also the convection of air currents to consider. Our O-Zone and green house gases allow the warming of the planet that is not facing the sun. Ice reflects heat back towards space and our layer of gases, which in turn, reflect that heat back. Water is a conductor of heat, once there is not enough ice or snow (white) to reflect that heat, water absorbs it instead. The convection of heat is lost from the air, causing a cooling effect, which over time will cause global temperatures to begin to cool. Over the course of the Earth&#39;s history there have been periods of immense cooling and warming. Ice has been proven to be a rare phenomenon on Earth.<br /><br />And before a lot of people say that people who don&#39;t believe in human made climate change are sceptics; that is almost never the case.

Over the past 130 years, humans raised the level of CO2 in the atmosphere from 280ppm to 400ppm - an increase of 40% 2. For the last 800,000 years at least, the level of CO2 hasn't risen above 300pm 3. The level of CO2 was much higher in the distant past (millions of years ago) but at this time the sun's output was 4% dimmer, so the additional CO2 was required to trap the heat in. 4. CO2 is not a problem for air quality. The only reason why it should be reduced is if it acidifies the ocean and causes warming (both of which the majority of climate scientists agree it does)""",UCwrXKgx_W3YygzpRFrQvfng,1,UgjLesJzAWbpTHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Yes, we add very much CO2 into the atmospere, we add more than nature can naturally disolve, yes, it causes a wheather to warm up a little bit, but is this all really that bad? After all, let&#39;s face it, CO2 is not a poison nor contaminant and abundance of CO2 with warmer climate means that a great landmasses in the north will quickly fill with forests and go from subarctic climate into a nice and habitable land where we can live and grow food. Billions of people can move to Canada, Greenland, Russia if they are free from ice and habitable enough. Worst case scenario, uninhabitable places on Earth will move from the Arctic and Antarctic to places like Africa. And we won&#39;t be able to cause that drastic change just by burning available fossil fuels, we&#39;d have to invent a brand new way to heat up our planet to cause that. All, that things like carbon tax do is stretch the period of fossil fuel burning to a longer time period and stop the development of poor countries. Stop scaring everyone with global warming, with a current level of technology we can&#39;t possibly hurt our planet enough to make it uninhabitable or even significantly less inhabitable. Accumulating a little extra heat is even good for us in a long run, given that in a greater time scale of hundreds of millions of years we are slowly moving from the boiling lava ball to a frozen icicle.

I mean people speak about ocean rising, extreme weather conditions such as huricanes and so on. But it is quite hard to make conplex idea about what can happen and in which time horizon. I was thinking about this especially on my visit to northern Europe, while seeing all those cities and land close to sea (and experiencing unusually warm winter, that that hardly anything to do with global warming). Furthermore it would be nice to have some comparison to history. It is generally know that there was an ice age, I believe that it is less known that there were also times when climate was warmer (vikings were having agriculture on greenland, which is mostly ice now, and so on), so it would be nice to have comparison of what can happen to us with those historical fluctuations. That would give clearer view of how much mankind added to global warming (if that can be estimated).<br /><br />Furthermore, I feel the need to express my disappointment with the fact that people seem to connect anti-global-warming changes only with renewable energy sources. I&#39;d say that easiest solution to stop dumping large amount of CO2 to atmosphere would be to employ more nuclear power plants: they are generally quite safe (Fukushima was badly placed and old, Chernobyl was fatal human mistake, not technical problem in first place), they generate no CO2 and they generate less radioactivity that coal power plants. Also they are several orders of magnitude more powerfull than renewable power sources as far as I know (with possible exception of really huge water dams, but those can&#39;t be built anywhere…).

I think it&#39;s farming or factory/powerplant (1/2, transportation 3rd). And it&#39;s not just CO2 that cause greenhouse effect, it&#39;s actually methane and water vapor (that not return down as rain/mist) do the most effect. Although big volcano eruption(s) can make a big-drastic-n-rapid climate change too. <br /><br />And climate change is a chain reaction, speeding up chain reaction.

It sounds like you're looking at the case for 2 degree rise and what problems that might have. Sure if it's a 2 degree rise, we should be able to deal with the problems economically. However that 2 degree rise is based on us actually doing a lot, starting right now. Massive cuts everywhere. That ship sailed some time ago. We're not going to have massive cuts starting September 2014. We could have had massive cuts by September 2014 if we'd started when I first became aware of the problem in 1974. We might even have managed it when the general public became aware of it in 1984. Now it's too late. So in reality, given best case scenarios we're probably locked into 4-6 degree rise and if we just continue business as usual it's 10-20 degree rise. 10-20 is a big range. At 10 degrees we get a 60 metre rise in sea level and the loss of most arable land. Indeed most arable land becomes lethally hot. 20 degrees is worse which leads on to point 2 2. I couldn't find any figures for either. Anecdotal evidence is pointless and my own views on this are biased as a result of my having been in a city where 5000 people died in one day due to heat. Seeing bodies lying everywhere about the street while I hide in the air-conditioned hotel and guards stop the masses from coming inside is not an experience I think anyone can have without it colouring subsequent viewpoints. Particularly when I had CNN on the telly and they were showing the Army setting up air-conditioned tents for people in Texas where 50 people had died. Still, putting that aside and only looking at the figures. It is possible to live in very cold places if you take appropriate precautions. Poor people live successfully in the Arctic. On the other hand when when wet bulb temperatures pass 36 degrees it's generally fatal unless you have access to air-conditioning. Just google ""fatal wet bulb temperature"" to see what I mean. A 6 degree temperature rise puts about a billion people into a situation where they will need air-conditioning to survive. I think death on a titanic scale is inevitable. 3. No, that's just made up. Name one single shred of evidence that ""debunks"" the idea that adding a lot of heat to a weather system won't make it more energetic. 4. There's not the slightest evidence that the world hasn't warmed. In fact we can and now have measured the rate of warming. It's between 0.6 and 0.8 watts per square meter. We went into space and looked. That debunks the ""the world isn't warming"" idea just as completely at the ""world is flat"" idea was debunked when we went into space and looked back at the Earth. It is warming, we've looked. It is round, we've looked. That's just a fact.

It's comforting that you have read the skeptics literature. I question your assertion ""..earlier action is easier and cheaper than later action.."". There are many important points of skepticism broad across every aspect of AGW policy (all off the top of my head): 1. Dealing with any problem directly caused by any warming is more economical than any taxation/market policy. 2. Warming (heatstroke) causes less deaths than cooling (freezing) - the poor cannot afford heating - the people that progressives leave behind. 3. Much evidence which debunks the theories of alarming increases of wild weather. 4. And while you may find a small contradiction with Oceanic heat content you dismiss the growing consensus that the planet hasn't warmed for 17 or more years despite 95% of the models. That last point is important. I don't like debate in general, it's unstructured, and both sides of a debate are sure to continue to go round in circles clouded by varying levels of confirmation bias particularly on a subject as broad (not complex by any means, that's a political lie) as AGW.  I'm sure I can't change your mind, but at least I tried....

The Co2 levels are getting higher and getting trapped in the atmosphere. The suns rays and energy are going down and bounce off (obviously some does get absorbed because that’s how we get warm) but because of the higher levels of Co2 a lot more of it is getting absorbed. Thus rising temperatures and heating up the earth. Now because the earth is heating up the polar ice caps are melting. Animals are dying and soon the north pole an South Pole could completely melt. The ice caps also have stuff to do with the weather and since they have started melting weather and storms are becoming more extreme eg flooding, tsunamis, droughts. Also sea life is on the edge. So many coral reefs have bleached because of climate change. Even if the sea warms up by just 1 degree celcius it can cause chaos. Because of corals being bleached and destroyed fish and all of the animals that lived and thrived there are homeless. We are losing many beautiful parts of this earth because of climate change and using so so many fossil fuels. Things need to change. There are so many options. But people won’t change and deny all the evidence because fossil fuels make many people in the government heaps of money.

""The level of warming observed"" is actually more strongly correlated to the Sun's activity than to the CO2 level. In more detail. And this correlation has been verified on the data we have for centuries of sunspots observations. It is not only about the orbit variations, it is also about the sun itself. I am not blocking a voice disagreeing with my opinion, I consider that there has been way too much evidence disagreeing with the causality relationship between warming and CO2 level. It even seems that it is the warming that raises the CO2 level, and not the level that raises the temperatures. Just as if you told me, that there exists a real number that squared equals -1. Again, talking about global warming, pretending that humans are the only responsible, is wrong. You must at least mention the sun's role, and show it is at least as strong of an impact as humans' activity. Climate is a very complex thing, we still cannot fully model it, and it is not totally understood. Of course, there are obviously many different things impacting the climate.

Scientists don't talk of things being ""proven"" because it's too strong a word. There can be evidence for certain hypotheses and evidence against hypotheses, but ultimately it comes down to how much of each types exist. Scientists weigh up this data and, when there is enough evidence, they come to a consensus, as climate scientists have now. This doesn't necessarily mean they are right, but it certainly is suggestive. Regarding the sun, its impact on our climate is not in doubt. The cyclical changes in Earth's orbit have led to past changes in the way solar radiation impacts the Earth and on the resulting climate.

The problem is that you think it's an issue because you don't understand the science, or it seems, haven't ever actually read the literature, or get your information from blogs or the daily mail. The issue is that we're a net increase on the natural variation which is much larger but generally in balance. A piece of information YOU conveniently left out, but I'll just say you're ignorant of the process rather than a liar. If you can find anywhere in the literature that says humans are the primary contributors of CO2, rather than being a net increase on a larger natural variation, then you can call people liars. Also happy to concede that water vapor contributes to warming the most, again it's not the issue, it's that it's part of a larger feedback that I alluded to when I mentioned the hydrological cycle earlier and it's driven by the net increase in CO2. It's also only part of the issue. Water vapor has an incredibly short atmospheric life so it doesn't really matter how much we pump into the atmosphere, it will fall as precipitation or snow very readily. CO2 is important because it lasts a long time in the atmosphere and causes the increase in water vapor indirectly. Hey look, there's that positive feedback again. If you prefer to be ignorant rather than disingenuous, that's fine, it's the same outcome. But now you know of the isotopes, the competitive imbalance, the water cycle and the lag. So repeating them does make you disingenuous. I see you're quite happy to concede the point about CO2 isotope signatures, the lag and your misunderstandings about the philosophy of science.

It was only raised as a point of contention on the blogs of the scientifically illiterate who didn't understand that something can be part of a positive feedback, that is; the effect of a cause as well as a cause itself, which is the case with CO2. Historically global temperature rise was due mostly to insolation, albedo and a few other things, which causes a release of CO2, which feeds back to cause mechanisms of forcing and further temperature rise. This is exactly the point. The current rise in CO2 isn't caused by the natural forcing, but by the emission from human activity which positively feeds back to cause the natural mechanisms to cause further warming, like, as you say, increased water vapor. Plant growth isn't the issue and simply reducing the issue to plant growth is disingenuous. If you're developing a monoculture where all other factors are great for growth, by all means, pump in more CO2. But the planet isn't a monoculture and not all other factors are great for growth, or is it the singular issue. You're changing the competitive balance of an ecosystem in unpredictable ways; we all know that weeds grow faster than other species, that changing the CO2 also alters the hydrological cycle in such a way that drought becomes more severe, in which case you're worried about water and CO2 won't help, no matter how high it is. You're also looking at thermal expansion of the oceans, the increase in oceanic carbonic acid which effects carbonates in primary producers, etc, etc, etc, etc. ""Proven"" is a word not used anywhere in any piece of scientific literature. I'll delete my youtube account and resign as a scientist if you can find me where absolute proof is used in a research paper. There's a preponderance of evidence in complex systems science; like the science you find with climate change. The signature of the human portion of CO2 in the atmosphere has a isotopic signature and isotope geochemists use the relative levels of carbon isotopes to determine the sources and sinks of CO2. I'm not going to explain it, it's not too technical, but you should address this issue before saying there's ""no proof"".

CO2 levels are less than optimal for plant growth (400ppm is not even close to optimal)... Facts that you routinely choose not to mention (I say because you have an agenda.)... You take it as fact that man is causing temperature to rise. Why? By what scientific methodologically acceptable experiment have you proven this? The 0.28 figure includes a .0001% man made water vapor assumption and may even be a slightly high estimate of man made effect on temperature.,UCPa6XTrVOkmuCXHHVVAqOZQ,1,Ugh1XsokoHpfvngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Even though manmade CO2 emissions are small (35 GT) relative to the global circulation of CO2 (~780 GT), it upsets a balance between sources and sinks leading to a measurable increase in atmospheric CO2 (we add a net 15 GT or so of CO2 to the atmosphere annually). That's why the level of CO2 which had stayed below 300ppm for 800,000 years has now risen to 400 ppm. The climate had been fairly stable for the last 1000 years at a level of 280ppm so humans are responsible for a rise of about 40% in the level of CO2. Most scientists agree that a doubling of CO2 alone results in about 1C of warming. However we know there are positive feedbacks, like as the temperature warms, the water vapour in the atmosphere increases. So it's generally accepted that a doubling in CO2 results in a 2-3C temp rise if you include the amplifying effects of water vapour. So no, it is not true that man causes no more than 0.28% of temperature change. The factors are complicated and if you don't want to understand them you can easily say 'this can't be true, we're not causing global warming,' but I'm kindly asking you to reconsider.",UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,1,Ugh1XsokoHpfvngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I do however have a few problems and questions with regards to proposals to cut green house gas emissions in order to protect the environment:<br />1. Why is cutting carbon emissions the number one priority? Even if we cut 100% of our carbon emissions starting from today, CO2 would remain above 350 ppm till 2070 or 2080. If global warming is the main part of climate change, there are far cheaper and more effective ways of artificially reducing global temperatures, so why is all the fuss about CO2?<br /><br />2. Why are we assuming that climate change a bad thing? Many species will actually benefit from climate change; ie, animals that enjoy warmer climates, almost all plants (since plants eat CO2 they actually grow faster the more carbon is in the atmosphere) and I do believe humans would also benefit (not from health, but economically we would be better off with a slightly warmer environment)<br /><br />Until I can be convinced that climate change is bad for humans AND cutting CO2 emissions is the most effective way to protect the environment, I will oppose any government legislation which intends to cut CO2 emissions.",UCvXY1feQ2Q7-jd_hhb2VTyA,0,Uggp0UOtn0brSngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The Co2 levels are getting higher and getting trapped in the atmosphere. The suns rays and energy are going down and bounce off but because of the higher levels of Co2 a lot of it is getting absorbed. Thus rising temperatures and heating up the earth. Now because the earth is heating up the polar ice caps are melting. Animals are dying and soon the north pole an South Pole could completely melt. The ice caps also have stuff to do with the weather and since they have started melting weather and storms are becoming more extreme eg flooding, tsunamis, droughts. Also sea life is on the edge. So many coral reefs have bleached because of climate change. Even if the sea warms up by just 1 degree celcius it can cause chaos. Because of corals being bleached and destroyed fish and all of the animals that lived and thrived there are homeless. We are losing many beautiful parts of this earth because of climate change and using so so many fossil fuels. Things need to change. There are so many options. But people won’t change and deny all the evidence because fossil fuels make many people in the government heaps of money.

The CO2 has the annoying ability to dissolve in water, making it acidic which can affect the animals not used to these fluctuations (but you probably already know that). The heat and humidity is helping bacteria, fungi, vectors etc to infect and spread more rapidly than ever. There are more effects on animals which I haven't mentioned.

Yes the sun does have some current benefits (really good source of vitamin D) but that's only if you're out in the sun sparingly. The reason it's good sparingly is because we have our atmosphere and ozone layer protecting us from it's harmful rays.

Our world is simply too complex to say with 100% certainty that any given solution will work or not, especially on this scale. On the problem side however, I am thoroughly convinced of the existence and I will give you a few reasons why. I try to list them somewhat chronologically. 1. Climate change causes more weather extremes. Climate change does not necessarily mean that it will get warmer all year around. Minor fluctuations in temperature can have massive impact on the severity of short term weather events. A good example would be hurricane Katrina. After moving over Florida, Katrina continued her path over the Gulf of Mexico, the warmer than usual water actually increased the power of Katrina to a catastrophic 'category 5' hurricane. Not only will warmer water increase severity of hurricanes, it will also increase frequency. This is a trend we already see happing for several decades. 2. Extinction. We are currently experiencing the 6th mass extinction event the earth has ever seen (as far as archeological research tells us). The complexity of climate change brings along more change than only temperature or weather extremes. Higher temperatures, however, will allow for insects like mosquitos and usually tropical viruses to flourish further away from the equator towards the poles. 3. Sea level. Historically speaking it has been interesting for people to settle near bodies of water, as it made trade easier. Currently hundreds of millions of people live close to coast lines. Areas that are inhabitable with the predicted sea level rise. If this trend of climate change continues, mass migrations will follow, with a lot of social disruption as an effect. You can already see what kind of impact a massive influx of immigrants has on some western nations in Europe. I think these are the most urgent and important issues regarding climate change. I would rather have our leaders and the people take action on plans that only have a probability of working out positively than just sitting here in inaction, just anxiously waiting for it all to blow over.",UC5EvAdFc-XRmYZqwULufe0w,1,Uggp0UOtn0brSngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Here's a response to it: ""We fully agree with T. J. Goreau that calcification by coccolithophores contrasts with that of other marine organisms (e.g. corals and foraminifera). Coccolithophore calcification occurs within the cell, rather than externally to that cell, and consequently coccolithophores are potentially able to exert a much more sophisticated control over their calcification process. However, we strongly disagree with the suggestion by Goreau that calcification and photosynthesis are tightly coupled. Several studies have indicated that the coccolithophore calcification to photosynthesis ratio ranges from considerably less than one, to greater than two (1–4). Specifically, the absence of a tight coupling between photosynthesis and calcification has been clearly demonstrated by analyses recording only a minor reduction in photosynthetic rates when coccolithophores were cultured in a calcium-free medium (thus preventing calcification) (5). Goreau argues that only when nutrients are plentiful, can phytoplankton be CO2 limited. The nitrate and phosphate concentrations used in our experiments were chosen to be consistent with those used in previous experiments (6), and indeed represent nutrient-replete conditions. Therefore, to answer this question we refer the reader to our down-core reconstruction of coccolith mass. This record indicates that the calcification response observed in the laboratory under nutrient-replete conditions is applicable also under the nutrient-limited conditions of the real ocean. However, we know that phosphate limitation can increase calcification in Emiliania huxleyi (1). Consequently, we agree that an important further step will be to assess the role played by nutrient limitation (iron, nitrate, phosphate) in influencing the phytoplankton physiological response to elevated CO2 levels. Despite the challenging experimental limitations, imposed by the vast complexity of marine ecosystems, our study provides an important insight into the acclimation of calcifying phytoplankton to high CO2 conditions.

They're not going to like instantly die, but their population won't be as high. Most animals that enjoy warmer climates... Well... They're probably already living in warmer climates where they can survive just fine, so there won't be much difference. What will happen is that the ecosystem will be severely be disrupted, and species will just start getting extinct. The populations of corals are already decreasing because of the warming of oceans. Then comes the rise of the sea levels, which will make many islands and coastal cities extinct. Do you know what the maximum altitude is in the Maldives? 2.5 meters. Yep. Bye bye Maldives. An anomalous worldwide temperature increase of 1.5C is CRAZY high! I don't know why some people think it's harmless, but whatever. Plus, the melting of ice caps only means that global warming will be accelerated. Not only can more water absorb more radiation, but there's also the methane trapped inside ice. If a certain point is reached, the methane is just going to go into the atmosphere, increase the temperature, which will lead to more ice melting and more methane going into the atmosphere, and we have NO way to stop that if that happens. The process is just going to continue until all the methane is out. If you think that there is another way to counteract the effects of global warming other than cutting gas emissions, I'd like to hear it, because no affordable way has been found to decrease worldwide temperature or reduce greenhouse gas levels.

Totally not what I'm talking about, and while I do support use of natural gas as a peaker, I don't support relying on it for baseload, and you can't get around the fact that while it is cleaner, it's not clean. Far from it. Again, as I said, it doesn't matter how much more efficient you make something if you need to keep doing it more and more over time. The advantages of natural gas being cleaner are erased as you use more and more of it to meet growing power demands. And you can use the word invest all you want, it doesn't actually add anything to the discussion. Also, dat run-on sentence. Carbon capture is nice, but it can only really be done at source, and it doesn't solve the storage problem. Carbon capture from the general atmosphere is a pretty dumb idea in general. Nature only manages it because of huge excesses of energy, and at extremely low efficiency. Using captured CO2 to do this conceptually closes the loop, but in actuality is hilariously silly. In order to take the CO2 and water and re-make the fuel you, at 100% efficiency, need to put in the same amount of energy you'd get out of the fuel (basic chemistry will tell you this). In reality, no process is 100% efficient. So even if you used the power the plant generated to convert the CO2 and water back into fuel, you still would need to have another generator somewhere supplying the power to compensate for the inefficiency in the conversion process. So, in reality, converting the CO2 back into fuel would cost more energy than burning the original fuel would have released. And this is all ignoring that power generators are far from 100% efficient themselves. At every step, energy is lost. In reality you might, at best, require three power plants to turn the CO2 produced by one power plant back into fuel. All of which isn't even a short-term solution to the problem of elevated greenhouse gas levels. Lowering emissions won't get rid of the symptoms of higher GHG levels we're going to experience over the coming decades and century. Don't get me wrong, I don't think geoengineering is a good solution, I just think it might be the best one we have for the time being. Take the space-mirror example though. You make one bad assumption here, it seems to me. You assume that it needs to reflect the light, or even stay intact. All it needs to do is block a bit of light from hitting the earth. Even if it breaks up over time, we only need it to be up there for a matter of decades to a century. After that, it's actually better if it disappears, as we won't need it as greenhouse gas levels return to more reasonable levels, and if we retained zero or a small amount of emissions, after a couple centuries, the spacemirrors would actually be cooling the earth with GHG levels returned to pre-industrial (although that's not a goal I care about, it is something we'll eventually reach as we lower emissions significantly, and wait a couple centuries).",UCo5xktFUuUuPSNXGzmKP0kw,1,Uggp0UOtn0brSngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The cost of moving more vehicles to electric? Better practices in other industries, etc.? I expect that will cost more in the short term but less in the long term. That's why I said these solutions are like a patch on the problem. Maybe they're cheaper to address the symptoms of the problem for a few years, but how do the costs work out over 20 years? 50? 100? Adapting to changes that replace fossil fuel power with other power may cost more in the short-term, but they actually solve the problem, rather than merely treating the symptoms. And let's be realistic, this is the heart of how we'll cut emissions, especially when you consider that power consumption is growing fairly rapidly. You may make a process 5% more efficient, but that doesn't make a difference if you increase production 5% over the same time period. There's also only so efficient things can be made, and even at no new emissions, the damage we've done is going to have serious long-reaching implications. That's why I think what we really need is a combination. We need to use short-term measures, perhaps like trepur's suggestion of spraying chemicals to reflect some incoming light, to lower energy incoming while we reduce emissions.

Wait, droughts suck for everything, and deprive us of the already diminished quantities of fresh water we rely upon heavily? We'd have to rely on massive and costly desalination plants and either move towards large sources of salty water (coasts), or develop massive water transport systems, which would also skyrocket costs? If we moved to coasts, we'd be far more crowded, goods would have to travel farther, and storms would cause far more damage? Massive systemic damage to nearly every ecosystem on earth would occur as climate changes occur and animals are forced to migrate, often at a rate far faster than is viable for many species, causing major die offs in nearly every ecosystem around the world? Huh. The entire argument here is generally pretty flawed. Massive regions of good land for a variety of things will be destroyed by climate change. You may try to argue that land that's too cold now will become warmer. You're right, but it's not GOOD land. Have you ever been in those cold regions? The soil is thin, and infertile. It would take thousands of years for the renewed land to become as productive as the land you're displacing in the process, and hundreds of years for the world to adapt to the change, all at the detriment of mankind. And I believe I said this before, but whether cutting carbon is the most efficient or cheapest solution, you can't get around the fact that it's the most effective solution, long-term. Far less green house gases entering the atmosphere = everything fixes itself in the long term, and the problem ceases to exist. Things like spraying chemicals to fix the problem may be cheaper, but they don't actually fix the problem. They're just patches on the issue. Short-term fixes for a long term problem. They also don't do things like help us deal with finite oil reserves, or pressure us nearly so much to get off of them ASAP. Economics drives innovation, so provide an economic incentive for innovation to occur. Your solution is like getting a mortgage and paying the minimum each month. Eventually you may end up paying it off, but you're not doing much to address the underlying problem (in this analogy, the principal). Because those dikes aren't permanent solutions? Eventually, anything you put in the way will fail. You have to keep putting in large expense to manage this. And as sea levels rise, do you think coastal cities are going to manage? Every one of them? Cause I think we both know that's an enormous cost to fight an uphill battle against an enemy that will never cease. Oh, and have fun redirecting the oceans. I'm sure that will work. And your premise on cost is .... kind of daft too. Where's the cost of lower CO2 levels? Non-hydrocarbon power isn't meaningfully more expensive than hydrocarbon power. Hell, there are multiple other sources of power that are on par with hydrocarbon fuels, and land-based wind is one of the cheapest sources of power per unit power generated, if problematic for other reasons. Transportation? Growth and advancement of electric vehicles (several times as efficient), and removal of the least efficient component of any vehicle: the driver (seriously, a simple adoption of different driving practices can basically double the mileage the typical driver gets). Better land management and agricultural practices? Preferably a diet lighter on meat as well.

They do not add up because they are ignoring the effects of convection in cooling the Earth's surface. Around 2000 they were saying that trapping 2 w/m^2 was causing all the warming, but that didn't turn out to be enough energy so they upped it to to 4 or 5. That doesn't work either. Then we find out that the Temp Stations had all sorts of issues like having asphalt paved under them or refrigerators next to them. We are very close to the exact midpoint of the current interglacial period which began 10-14 thousand years ago depending upon who you ask. Sea levels were 10 meters higher 125,000 years ago at the height of the last interglacial with CO2 at 280ppm. A region of heated atmosphere (with 280ppm, 380 ppm, or 580ppm) expands no matter the source. With that expansion comes Convection. We always hear about the Heating, but do you ever hear about Cooling? We need to observe the cooling that goes on as well to see the whole picture. Thermodynamic Law states that systems are always trying to be in equilibrium and will use the path of least resistance to achieve it. If you add resistance to radiation, then convection easily picks up the difference. I disagree that there is a 'greenhouse' effect with regards to gases.

It results from the fact that certain atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, are able to change the energy balance of the planet by absorbing longwave radiation emitted from the Earth's surface."" Okay, so an increase in CO2 leads to absorbing more IR which leads to an increase in temperature in that region (i.e. near the surface). I get it. It is extremely small, but I get it. So what I'm asking is ""Will that extra temperature lead to lower density? If so, will the lower density lead to a higher advection rate? If it does as the laws of physics demands, then the extra heat absorbed by the CO2 is just as easily transferred away from the surface via convection. The energy may be trapped in the CO2 molecule, but that molecule is not tethered to the Earth. It wants to move to a region of lower energy/pressure, which is up. There are two modes of transport between the surface and the Tropopause. Convection, while slower than Radiation (speed of light), is the primary means of transporting mass and energy from the surface to the upper Troposphere. What does 'change the energy balance of the planet' mean? The problem is that 'seems' like it means something valid until you start to break it all down. Nature has more than one way to reach equilibrium and what you find is that balance is maintained, it just uses another way to achieve it. No, the entire scientific community is not wrong, just those that think the additional CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing a nonexistent 'greenhouse' effect.

Can you describe the phenomena in actual terms rather than fundamentally different causes? This is little different in trying to teach someone about magnetism and calling it the 'Gravity Effect'. Just explain it in terms of gravity if that is what you are describing, right? What is being described as the Greenhouse Effect is really an Anti-Emissivity Effect. More CO2 slightly reduces the radiative emissivity in the lower atmosphere, 15 meters and below for the most part. This will slightly heat the atmosphere above levels compared to lower CO2 levels.

A primary area of confusion is trying to visualize an atmosphere as a greenhouse. They are not the same thing and are actually quite the opposite. Atmospheres covering variable landscapes that get heated for an average 12 hours and cooled for an average 12 hours do not in any way behave like a 'greenhouse'. Greenhouses work by preventing convection, atmospheres encourage convection. If you heat a region of air no matter whether by conduction, radiation, or so-called 'trapped' radiation that region will expand, become less dense, and be pushed skyward by gravity dragging cooler more dense beneath it. So if you 'trap' radiation, then you are simply increasing the convection rate keeping the incoming and outgoing radiation in equilibrium. Heating a region of air unevenly with other regions creates convection If you observe the atmosphere as what it is (an elastic fluid that stretches and advects), especially the Troposphere that sees temp diferentials of 65 to 80 C between the Tropopause and Surface, then you can get a better idea of how difficult it is to 'trap' energy when there are regions close to it that are cooler. It decfreases from average 15C to -56C. Our 'thin' light atmosphere appears 'thin' from outspace, but from the surface it is quite massive heavy, over 10,000 kilograms per square meter. 5,000 Trillion metric tons, of which ~900 Billion is CO2. That is my justification to be skeptical. The issue is not climate change, the issue is Anthropogenic Climate Change. Now say you just stumbled on to this, ask yourself, Does the atmosphere behave like a 'greenhouse'? If so, how does it prevent Convection? How does an increase in regional temp not equal an increase in volume and therefor decrease in density resulting in faster advection that leads to faster cooling?

It turns something businesses can now just ignore, despite them hurting the people of the world, into something they have to pay for, and address.

In a more restricted sense, a scientist may refer to an individual who uses the scientific method."" Most humans are scientists when it comes down to it; though in the more restricted use of the term, most are not, including but not limited to those who call themselves 'Climate Scientists'. The restriction comes into play when considering that 'scientists' adjust their hypotheses when new evidence is presented. 'Climate' scientists hold fast to their hypotheses no matter what evidence is introduced and resort to ad hominem if it conflicts. Years ago a professor of mine (physics) explained Peer Review in this way. First you test your theory (if/then statement) to see if it holds water. Then you sleep on it and test it again. If your theory holds water again, then you ask someone you trust (A Peer) to test the theory. By test he meant 'tries to actually falsify the theory'. If they can't falsify the theory, then depending upon how confident you are, only then should you publish your theory. A peer review is not a necessary (but good idea) step in the Scientific Method, but a Critical Review is. That is someone who doesn't give a rats turd who you are must emphatically try to falsify your claims. He reminded us that 'scientists' are about the meanest and ugliest people when it comes to CRITICALLY Reviewing theories. Smart people usually have enormous egos and this is the root of this behavior. There are many cases of this including Einstein when he published General Relativity. Ad hominem is quite common in the scientific world. You can't take these attacks personal, it is just the way it is. Sadly most GW talk is done by those who do not understand the physics behind energy transfer. They 'Google' ""Climate Change"" and decide what to Cut & Paste depending upon whether they 'trust' the source. There is no understanding, it is plain and simple 'blind' trust. How can they verify?

Greenhouses work because they prevent cooler more dense air from being dragged beneath warmer less dense air. Greenhouse 'effects' can only come from a Greenhouse 'Cause'. Most AGW Advocates admit that IR absorbing gases do not create a greenhouse, but they dismiss the misnomer as being trivial. If you called Magnetism the Gravity Effect, most physicists would get irritated. Gases, being fluids, cannot prevent Convection, but rather they readily convect with temperature variance. 2. The Ideal Gas Law shows that if you expand the volume of a gas, the temp decreases. 3.

If you have specific questions I can probably answer them. My biggest issue is that those who claim to understand the science refuse to address these and a few more issues.

They are cooked. If you would like to be specific, then I can respond with greater detail. Curious, how did sea levels reach 10 meters higher 125,000 years ago when CO2 levels were 280ppm? A primary source of confusion in debating this topic lies in that the Convection Effect, which is a result of Gravity, the variable density/temp of gases, and the fluid nature of gases is ignored while focusing solely on the misnamed greenhouse effect, which does not exist. That statement will likely upset most AGW Advocates, but a fact is a fact. Gases make very poor Greenhouses since greenhouses prevent Convection. When you have different regions of air of varying temperature and add gravity to the mix, it creates Convection. The greater the difference in temp/density, the greater the convection rate. All wind on the surface of the planet is a result of Convection. When you consider that the atmosphere within the Convection Zone (aka Troposphere) has a mass of 4,000 Trillion metric tons, you can see that a great deal of temperature is converted into kinetic energy as well. If you increase the temp of the atmosphere at or near the surface by reducing the emissivity, then you have still increased the temp. This increase in temp expands that region of gas making it less dense than lower temp regions of gas above or next to it. Gravity then drags the cooler more dense air under the higher temp gas. If additional CO2 reduced the effect of gravity, or reduced the expansion of gas with increased temps, then the CO2 argument might hold water.",UCy-pN2n1FyUyF0_YBbLFrbQ,1,Uggp0UOtn0brSngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

CO2 levels were around 280 parts per 1,000,000 at the last interglacial. So why the alarm? From an earlier post to Veritasium explaining my issues with the consensus. 1. The GreenHouse Effect. Would you agree that you need a 'greenhouse' to get a 'greenhouse effect'? Why call it something that it is not? Greenhouses 'trap' heat by preventing Convection, but they still radiate as well all know. If you can somehow reduce the emissivity of the Earth's surface or lower troposphere, does that not increase the temp, thereby increasing the rate of Convection? What would stop Convection from cooling the surface and lower troposphere if the poorly named 'greenhouse gases' trapped more energy in that region? The average temp decreases from 15C to -56C from the surface to the Tropopause. That cooling is primarily the result of Convection, not Radiation. 2. The Elasticity of the Earth's Atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is elastic. The altitude of the Tropopause averages around 6,000 meters at the poles and 18,000 meters at the Equator. Imagine that the tropopause was fixed at 6,000 meters. The pressure would increase, and with increased pressure you get increased temps. Since the volume of the atmosphere is variable and expands with increased energy, the temp is reduced by increasing volume. A physics professor of mine explained 'temperature' as 'energy pressure'. This makes sense when looking at radiative rates and specific heat. 3. Milankovitch Cycle. The Milankovtich Cycle(s) correlate very well with the Glacial and Interglacial periods. It appears that the interglacial periods last around 25,000 to 30,000 years, the last glacial period ended around 12,000 to 14,000 years ago. Would we not expect to be nearing or at the height of the current glacial minimum? The sea levels were nearly 10 meters higher at the last glacial minimum without the additional CO2 levels. 4. N2 and O2. N2 and O2 make up 99% of the mass of our atmosphere and while they do not absorb or emit Infrared in the same spectrum as CO2, they do absorb and emit radiation. Both N2 and O2 have higher Specific Heat than CO2 both at constant pressure and constant volume as well. These gases are emitting huge amounts of energy both towards the surface and away. Far more than CO2 can possibly be responsible for. Much of the confusion that surrounds 'AGW' is caused by 'scientists' using the misnamed ""Greenhouse Effect' to describe a phenomena. It is not unlike calling Magnetism the 'Gravity Effect' or vice versa. They are two separate forces that can appear to the lay as the same or similar. Reducing the emissivity at or near the surface may appear to create a 'greenhouse effect', but this is not the case. Oddly enough, if you reduce emissivity, you also reduce absorption. In any event, if you answer these questions you will be the first AGW Advocate that I have come across. For if you do, it is quite difficult for you to keep your position. It appears it is better to ignore such questions than to admit mistake. Pity.",UCy-pN2n1FyUyF0_YBbLFrbQ,1,Uggp0UOtn0brSngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

At no point does your video seriously engage the scientific counter-evidence to a crisis based in human activity.  Instead the video attributes any doubts about the urgency of climate change to bad faith from ""businesses with vested interests"" or to silly ignorance on the part of the general public (e.g., it's about recycling).  The true believer position is characterized by a ""broad consensus"" of climate scientists. (The one list of supporting scientist I've seen have included a significant proportion of non-climate scientists, but admittedly I haven't seen the ""official tally"" of climate scientists to which adherents so often refer.  There are certainly serious scientists with serious counterarguments which one would expect 'VERITASium' to engage).  Even if the broad consensus is true, note that the broad consensus of scientists in the 1920s--including Einstein--would have us still believing we lived in a steady state universe. However, we don't because of the counterview presented by just one or two--LeMaitre and Hubble.   Moreover, when a ""broad consensus"" results in ridiculing critics and ignoring their arguments, attempting to get skeptical journal editors and others fired, modifying or selectively applying datasets--it clearly isn't science anymore. And it appears that only businesses could only be tainted by vested interests, never sainted academics with their substantial funding.   If it's not science, it's unfortunately either religion or political advocacy or perhaps simply a lack of research on your part. For any one of those reasons, the trust in what is presented is undermined. Maybe it's the inevitable result as with other publications that opted to incorporate 'truth' in their name.    (BTW, the model predictions have been famously wrong in spite of the data--fudged or otherwise). ",UCe_E749RA7WuK2hECEYu05g,1,Ugh_b9Fh8viWrngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

It absorbs IR headed into space and re-radiates it in all directions (including back at earth). We can see the IR it is sending back to us on Earth, and we can see the missing IR from space. A price on carbon is a generally accepted mechanism that has been put in place in Europe, California, New Zealand, parts of Canada, Japan and is being considered in Brazil and China. It is also endorsed by big fossil fuel companies like BP. Here I'm quoting from their website: ""We also believe that putting a price on carbon – one that treats all carbon equally, whether it comes out of a smokestack or a car exhaust – will make energy efficiency and conservation more attractive to businesses and individuals and lower-carbon energy sources more cost competitive. A global carbon price should be the long-term goal, but regional and national approaches are a good first step, provided temporary financial relief is given to sectors that are exposed to international competition."" Leaving the politics aside, coal is dirt cheap: 1. Dig up dirt 2. Burn dirt 3. All waste goes into the atmosphere for free Nothing will ever compete with coal on price - unless the wastes are taken into account somehow.

So even though more CO2 is beneficial for plant life (and although modern plants CAN thrive in our not-so-long-ago very low CO2 atmosphere), climate change might not be.

Human respiration is indeed dependent on CO2 levels and not oxygen levels as most people think, but it's not CO2 levels in the air; it's CO2 levels in the blood. As our cells respire, it increases the CO2 levels in the blood, which causes the blood to become more acidic (in the same way the ocean is becoming more acidic nowadays) and it's this changing pH that causes us to respire. I also don't see how increasing CO2 levels in the air could improve human respiration. If anything it would worsen is as the percentage of oxygen in the air would decrease and we'd have to breathe more quickly to take in the same amount of oxygen; this is exactly why you get out of breath at high altitude even if you're not doing something strenuous, because there's less oxygen.",UCMb8Oti9KKsWN7FE9L-ncLQ,1,Ugg0kiL8OyPhXHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The icecap is 3000 metres thick, precipitation on Greenland is under half a metre per year. Even if there were no glaciers pulling water out (which there are) you'd be looking at 6000 years of freezing temperatures being needed to build up an icecap that thick.

The whole denial case depends on making decisions that determine the fates of billions of people and all the life that shares our planet, without spending 3 seconds thinking first. It seems to work well with emotionally based decision making. (Sadly) What the Greenland cap does tell us, other than the obvious, that it's old, is that temperature has changed as much as 5 degrees in just one season. Ice cores give us a clear temperature and rainfall record for the area going back thousands of years. The climate is a chaotic system that can and has jumped suddenly to a new stable point. Anyone who's played with chaotic systems will tell you that giving them a solid shove can have unpredictable results. It may go a long way in the direction you shove, it may hardly move at all or it may go a long way in the *opposite* direction to the one you shove it. While in the short term, massive warming is certain, it's not impossible that we could trigger a mega ice age 1000 years in the future or a jump to a new stable and much hotter system. There's no record of any shoves in any direction in the last few 10s of thousands of years that are as strong as the one we're giving it now. Yet it has jumped suddenly to different temperatures.

The massive elephant in the room has been, and still is, “stratospheric aerosol geoengineering” (SAG), AKA  ”solar radiation management” (SRM). Aluminum/alumina, among other toxic metals, is showing up in countless rain tests around the world. The amount of aluminum, barium, and other metals in these rain/snow tests is always high and often completely off the charts. Snow tests from Mt Shasta in Northern California were toxic beyond belief. This area of the Pacific Northwest was thought to be a pristine water source. Dozens of rain samples taken in this region from numerous individuals were tested at the State certified lab in Northern California and showed shocking results without exception. Former US Forest Service Biologist Francis Mangles has confirmed the alarming heavy metal contamination with his own testing. Snow tests taken from the side of Mt. Shasta showed aluminum content as high as 61,000 PPB. (parts per billion). This level of aluminum in the snow is tens of thousands of times anything that might be considered “normal background” contamination. ",UCDFLImC0BPZxkHVd2-wyx9w,0,Ugh_bpWccmTahngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

OK, I hadnt checked my facts.  Below are the facts per the Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis site: http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph/     Arctic - current tracking             6.46M (average 1981-2010) 5.479M (2014, similar in 2014) - both within 2 standard deviations 3.728M (2012) - extremely low, and well outside of 2 standard deviations Note: the significant increase from 2012 to 2013, granted, only an increase in the last 2 months, otherwise yes, very low However... Antarctic 19.15M last two years - over 2 standard deviations above 1981-2010 average 18.22M (average 1981-2010) Note: 2014, day on day (for almost the entire year), has surpassed the average by more than 2 standard deviation! Note Also: 2011 was a relatively low year, dropping below the average by nearly 2 standard deviations for a few months So this years Antarctic figures do not suggest more frequent weather extreme's, more like consistently cooler weather.  However, I havent cross checked weather day to day in the region to verify. Also, arctic melting, should have little impact on sea levels right? its melting on land masses that are of concern (Greenland & antarctic) Just to be clear, I completely agree that humanity is having significant effects on our planet.  My doubt is in some of the observations and the flip flop action of some governments.  Perhaps its my lack of trust with governments, religious institutions, and science (given its history ... Semmelweis).  It's as if there is a 'gap' not being explained, or is withheld.  Perhaps a loss of true skeptics (or at least given a voice), and a loss of open mindedness!?",UCBFZx6kjKpnvBhaLDlsYsaA,1,UgiIM2JbC1rizXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

A little over 200 years ago we were in the last grasp of the &quot;little ice age&quot; which started in the &quot;dark ages&quot; some 800+ years ago, and 10,000-20,000 years ago we had mile thick glaciers over much of North America. Before the &quot;little ice age&quot; started grapes and wine used to be a major staple as far north as the British Isle&#39;s and much of northern Europe up to the Baltic Sea area. Wheat and Grain Beer&#39;s didn&#39;t become popular in the Germanic regions until it became too cold to grow grapes for wine. There was sudden cold snaps and weather extremes that caused &quot;years with no summers&quot; much like was seen in the late 1700&#39;s here in North America only to be reversed with years that were much warmer and closer to what we know now, and again this was during a &quot;little ice age&quot; period. <br /><br />That is a pretty damn fast &quot;climate change&quot; with no real impact from humans at the time, yet we are supposed to all believe a consensus of scientists who&#39;s data has yet to be accurate (vastly over predicted the raising of temperatures, sea levels, ect), have been caught via email fudging data to make it fit their computer models and predictions, and who have been caught colluding via Email to deceive the governments of the world about the results of Carbon Cutting prospects. This is the same science (or group think) that was screaming about Global Cooling and the coming New Ice Age in the 1970&#39;s due to dust and smog in the atmosphere, who used the hot days of summer with no Air Conditioning to convince and sell their point in the 1990&#39;s about the coming Global Warming, and now when their data and models haven&#39;t been accurate they change it to &quot;climate change&quot; and hope we&#39;ll swallow it all hook line and sinker yet again.<br /><br />Climate Changes are the only thing constant about the Earth, it warms, it cools, we&#39;ve reportedly been a a Fire ball (early early earth) before being a lush tropical paradise, a Dustball global (or nearly global) desert, an Iceball with glacial ice covering all of the planet from pole to pole, and everywhere in between, sometimes those changes were fast, sometimes slow, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve even caused some changes due to deforestation, ground clearing, urban heat sinks due to denuding and paving of the land, and maybe even from our fossil fuel use as well as methane production from animal and biomass waste. But raising taxes, baring emerging economies from the use of cheap energy, pushing technology that isn&#39;t able to meet or provide the energy requirements even during it&#39;s peak production times (full sun, high wind, ect) is not going to change the problem in the long run which is that the earth will continue to change according to what solar energy is sent here by the sun, what gases and dusts are in the atmosphere due to volcanic, wind, or human/animal movements, and how much land is exposed to receiving solar radiation. ",UC3LLj_SnBU27mEbRG_9OBpw,0,UgiwgVl7GOppHHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Yes we increase the atmospheric co2 but we humans are increasing in numbers and we need even more co2 stored in plants and animals we eat. Makes sense to say that to increase civilization we need more carbon circulating through the system. Also we need more water, more co2 in the atmosphere will increase the temperature and should increase the amount of water cycle. <br />It seems to me that more that freaking out about climate change we should learn about a new climate equilibrium. Maybe we don&#39;t need to cut or capture co2, it would be far easier to distribute fresh water. Unlike co2, water is not distributed evenly through the atmosphere. Some areas in the world are more likely to accumulate fresh water than others, that is why we see more drouts and even more floods. We humans have been moving water from a to b for thousands of years. I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t pump water 2000 miles to support more living things that will capture co2.

Something that couldn't really have been foreseen at the time. However that sort of farming is now dependent on a steady supply of fossil energy. For most farming between 10 and 100 times more energy is put in via fossil fuels than is taken out, via food. Even if CO2 wasn't opaque to IR light, there's a finite amount of fossil fuel. We either switch to renewable energy, or we hit the mathusian catastrophe somewhere down the track (at this rate they all run out in about 50-100 years) Actually it turns out that moving the tax away from taxing work and into taxing energy, far from causing the economy to go down the toilet, makes it stronger. Putting spending money in the hands of the workers and insentivising more work makes the economy work better. Which is kinda what you'd expect if you thought about it for more than 3 seconds. After all, if taxing something makes people avoid it, which would you rather people avoid: working, or running the A/C on high?

Again, you dismiss ""other factors"", not by deliberately discounting them, but instead by forgetting about them. We have a Grand Solar Maximum currently on deck, since 1900 - according to here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum - what if that changes? I'm well aware of the *Milankovitch* cycles - though they seem a little slow to account for most of our ""recent"" temperature variation, so I'll skip them here. How about another factor: Ice cap size. I found articles on the antarctic ice cap reaching record size. Does that not cool the planet? Could that not overwhelm the effect of CO2? Some articles suggest that it is caused by global warming - but if it's an enduring effect, global warming could trigger an ice age! Net effect is the item of interest - not temperature relative to the counterfactual world that doesn't have our CO2. The bucket analogy is excessively simple. Let's extend it with 2 changes: the dripping tap is actually dripping onto the lip of the bucket, and the bucket is sitting on a spinning top. Maybe if the water level goes up the bucket will spin more slowly, which will reduce the leak rate. But the wobble induced might result in the water dripping out of the bucket, lowering the water level. Additionally, angular momentum is being lost, so the wobble might be inevitable whether the hole is blocked or not. You absolutely can no longer predict in this example whether the water level will go up or down, or even what the impact of partially blocking the hole will be. And this system is still absolutely trivial compared with the global climate. Your discussion of dramatic temperature changes is certainly scary. You've convinced me that there is a pressing need for research and modelling - and supercomputing capable of performing that modelling. But the concept of ""We have to do something"" when you have *no idea* what course of action will bring what result has never held water with me. Finally, your discussions of energy in vs energy out are intriguing - is there any data available for those who are not in the ""scientific elite""?

I'm not sure if I can cope! Ok, you're perfectly correct that I've missed out a lot. I was attempting to give the bare bones of the subject, pretty much as it was first discovered 100 years ago. The bare bones establish conclusively that adding CO2 will increase the temperature of the planet. There's zero doubt about that any more than there would be zero doubt about the leaky bucket metaphor. Point 1, Incoming energy is it constant. (is the tap dripping at a constant rate). You're quite correct, it's not constant. There are at least 4 variabilities however none of them remove the basis of GW any more than a variability in the tap dripping means that the level of the water in the bucket isn't affected by the size of the leak. If you make the leak smaller (close the IR window) then the water level will be higher than it would otherwise have been. Orbital mechanics. The distance to the star, the orientation of the Earth to the star, the orientation of the ellipse and the oblateness of the ellipse. They get lumped together and called Malkovich cycles. They're all understood. If that was what was causing the temperature to rise we'd know about it. Actually the temperature should be falling very very slowly. 11 year solar cycles. The brightness of the star varies by an amount that adds up to about 0.25 Wm^-2 over each 11 year cycle. Reasonably well understood, or if not understood then at very least can be expected to recur regularly. Even when they're at their lowest, there is measurably more energy coming in than is leaking out. 0.58 Wm^-2 more energy was coming into the system in 2005-2010 (the last solar minimum) than was leaking out. Longer period solar cycles. Not yet actually observed but surmised to have been responsible for the medieval warm period. No sign of that happening at present. No stellar model really predicts them. Stellar evolution. The sun gets brighter as time goes on. (the tap drips faster). This actually means that previous high CO2 events aren't a completely reliable guide to what's happening now. Just because we got hot but there was no runaway then doesn't mean that we can be sure it won't happen today. We are absolutely sure it will runaway at some point but that point is currently about a billion years in the future (assuming we can't/don't trigger it early). Ok, so for point 1, you're right that the energy input is variable, but that doesn't change the basics of GW. Point 2 I'm not saying that CO2 is the only factor. I explicitly said that the other factors make calculating the final temperature outcome for a specific CO2 level difficult to impossible. I devoted more than half the post to that exact idea. If CO2 was the only factor, then we could simply plug the figures in and pop out the answer. It actually turns out that if we burn everything it's like turning the sun up by about 2.5%. It's completely trivial to work it out. You're wrong to say “Until we can model the climate with some accuracy, we won't know if the world is warming or cooling,” We can model if it's heating or cooling quite easily without knowing the details of the system. Going back to the bucket again. By knowing that the water level in the bucket is stable, knowing that the tap is dripping and knowing that it hasn't reached the lip of the bucket then you can say for sure that it's leaking and you can say for sure that blocking up the leak will make the water level go up. There's no doubt about that. It doesn't depend in any way on the shape of the bucket, the size of the bucket, the size of the leak, the current level of the water, the speed of the drips, or any other factor. In fact we can tell how fast water is accumulating in the bucket with just two figures, how much water is going in and how much water is coming out. That tells you everything you need to model water accumulation. Similarly, by measuring the energy arriving and energy leaving you can work out how much energy is accumulating on earth. That's been done. It turns out there's 3x10^14 W more coming in than leaving. This doesn't mean we know where that energy will end up or what the final temperature will be. That's important too and subject to on going research, however just to repeat, working out if it's warming, cooling or stable is completely trivial. It's warming. You ask the question: “Tell me, did a bunch of forest fires end the ice age?” Well actually, the worst ice age in history, was ended, not by forest fires, but by volcanoes, however the same principle applies. I think it also demonstrates how significant those positive feedbacks can be. Now I was careful to keep it to the well understood effects of CO2. It seems this has backfired somewhat in that you got the idea I didn't know about the other effects. So lets just explore this particular instance of positive feedback. Cast your mind back 600 million years. You'll see most long term climate graphs stop 550 million years ago and the reason seems to be that if you included the time before that the Y axis would be so compressed that you couldn't see any temperature variation at all after 550 million years ago. 600 million years ago the average temperature was about 50 degrees below. The world was completely frozen from pole to pole. There was no open ocean at all and the continent (the only one) was completely covered in ice. The conditions at the equator were about the same as we have on the Antarctic dome now. No precipitation at all. No visible life. Bleak white as far as the eye can see. Gradually volcanic action built up CO2 in the atmosphere. We're not completely certain what level it reached but it slowly warmed the planet and about 550 million years ago some ocean appeared. That darker ocean absorbed more heat than the white ice around it. That melted more ice and increased the amount of dark water that increased the amount of heat captured and so on. In a period too short for us to have identified how long it actually was, it looks instant in the geological record, the temperature jumped to plus 20 C. That positive feedback increased the temperature by near on 70 degrees C in a period too short for us to determine. So I gave the bare minimum of temperature change that will result from increasing the CO2. However the Earth has demonstrated that it can warm suddenly and by 70 degrees if pushed hard enough. It's not impossible that we could make another similar jump to a new stable temperature that's not compatible with life. When I gave the best case scenario that was the CO2 alone with no feedbacks like the ocean one. The worst case scenario is the one where the feedbacks work together. CO2 increases the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere (we've already observed this, it's about 5% higher than it was). Water vapour is a strong green house gas, so it increases the temperature at the surface. That feeds back for a while until the tundra melts. When it melts it releases 50 billion tonnes of Methane in under a year. That blocks a different part of the IR spectrum to the water and CO2, pretty much stopping up the leak completely. Enormous quantities of water evaporate into the atmosphere. Much of it makes it's way into the stratosphere. At that point it stops being the temperature of the surface that sets the amount of IR being emitted. It's the temperature of these very very high clouds. Light passes through them, the IR doesn't escape. The oceans evaporate, the surface pressure rises to 300 bar, dark still oxygen free and about 400 degrees C. That's what people call “alarmist” but there's a non zero chance of that being the outcome. The amount of solar radiation needed to produce that is as far as we can tell almost exactly the same as the current level of solar radiation. So to sum up I think I've demonstrated that it's not that complex to figure out if the Earth is going to heat up or not. We're sure that it is heating up and we know why. The minimum effect would come if there were no positive feedbacks, which is close to a zero probability, particularly as we've already seen evidence of positive feedback. The minimum effect will be to make the tropics uninhabitable. Much of the tropics are already close to the maximum temperature that humans can survive. The worst effect means everything dies.",UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA,1,UgisFYlppRmg5ngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The chart is incredibly highly processed, and if I'm reading it right, the null hypothesis is compatible with the chart until 2025, assuming the hypothesis is from 2000. I don't call that significant evidence. Science is not consensus. Science the process of understanding pre-existing reality. Scientific consensus is somewhat useful for the progress of human knowledge, but independent thought is what drives Science. Einstein did not become right when consensus changed - he was always right, and the evidence proved it. If the consensus still did not believe in his theories, he would still be right. You can't vote on the truth. Unless you're in the world of 1984. Perhaps you think you are unqualified to challenge the scientific consensus. That is a rational point of view. I've considered the science, the politics and the economics of the matter, found the science weak and the politics strong. This reduces the personal significance of such consensus to me from ""near zero"" to ""below zero"". Making predictions that are not falsifiable (or simply too numerous to be significant), followed by comparing with the counterfactual, is the domain of theists, and, sadly, economists. By calling ""Climate Scientists"" scientists, the significance of the word ""Science"" is eroded - as a result, if cooling does turn out to be dominant, no-one of our generation will believe ""scientific consensus"" about anything, ever. From that point forward, ""Scientists are then just another batch of politicians with another set of agenda, and what do they know anyway?"" Is that a risk any of you are willing to take?

Like totally absurd, I don't even understand how you could miss it. But it is an absolute requirement for your line of reasoning. Did you know human civilization is visible from space? How about the factor that the *colour* of the planet has changed? Oh, doesn't affect visible light... oh wait, sure it does. You know, solar panels are pretty reflective, a lot like ice caps. I could find factors all day, both natural and man made. Tell me, did a bunch of forest fires end the ice age? Then there was the Younger Dryas, when the fires went out, but humans with campfires warmed the planet up again... Come on. How come CO2 is the only factor now? Until we can model the climate with some accuracy, we won't know if the world is warming or cooling, and we won't know how to influence it. That's Science, followed by Engineering. I recall the doomsday predictions of global cooling when I was a kid, and I understand they're coming back into fashion. The fact is that our modelling is *still* inadequate. Now let's step outside the science of the matter and look at the engineering. Governments can't stop the CO2 output. The largest emitter is... China. 3rd is India. Bestaluck convincing them to let their people starve. On the other hand, is it possible to cool the planet down with atmospheric engineering? Apparently dust does the job rather well, and is naturally self-eliminating. It would likely be cheaper than cutting all that CO2 emission out - if necessary. What about warming the planet up? Well... that's actually harder. A blanket might keep you warm, but it won't do such a good job for objects without their own heat.

Since the basic idea of global warming is over 100 years old and (nearly) completely classical rather than quantum, I'm sure you can follow it in a reasoned scientific argument. Ok, here goes. Here are the facts. Not theory, not opinion, just facts that anyone can verify (with a little equipment). 1) Temperature is a measure of the energy in a system 2) Energy arrives on Earth mostly as visible light 3) Energy leaves as Infra Red light (IR) and the amount is proportional to the 4th power of the absolute temperature (that's the only quantum part, the 4th power. The rest is classical) 4) If the amount of energy arriving is more than the amount leaving, the energy level (and temperature which is a measure of energy) goes up 5) CO2 is opaque to some IR. 6) We have released a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere, lots is still there. If you put those facts together then the basis of global warming can be no more scientifically contentious than the idea that if you put a leaky bucket under a dripping tap the level of water in the bucket will rise until the amount leaking out equals the amount coming in. If you partially block the leak the water level will rise. If you block up the leak completely, the water level will rise until it finds another way out, like over the lip of the bucket. To extend that metaphor, the ""lip of the bucket"" is the point where the surface temperature gets so high that the frequency of the IR light moves up into the visible. That's the situation on Venus where the rocks glow dull red. Ok so from that I think we can safely say that global warming is beyond a shadow of doubt. It is happening. The next thing is how much difference does increasing CO2 from 250 ppm to .... some other amount really make. Well that would be a reasonably simple calculation except for the fact that when you raise or lower the temperature of something as messy as the Earth (despite the fact that it actually *is* a spherical object in a vacuum) it changes it's reflectivity and it changes the composition of the atmosphere. That's where the science, though reasonably well nailed down, is open to some interpretation. Still, the amount of CO2 that would be released by ""business as usual"" is easily enough to cause catastrophic climate change *by itself*. It would make pretty much the entire tropical area uninhabitable. So that's about half the world population either die or move to your country (if you're outside the tropics). Remember that's the *best case* assuming that there are no positive feedbacks when you say, melt all the ice and turn it into black rock and dark ocean, release the methane stored in the tundra, release the methane stored as hydrates on the sea floor, increase the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere which is itself a strong IR blocker, that works at different frequencies to CO2, vastly extending the ""blocking"" effect. There are also negative feedback loops. Low cloud will limit the effect, but don't forget you can only get more low cloud if it's already hotter and if there's more water vapour (which pretty much means you only get this effect *after* the GW takes effect). If you include all the positive feedback loops and look at the worst case, it gets hot enough to sterilise the planet. Everything dies. Nailing down exactly where the reality lies is the only controversy left. Business as usual will result in something on that spectrum between best case (half the world's population moves elsewhere) and worst case (everything on the planet dies) So there you go. A well reasoned, fact based scientific argument. There's no theory, no contention, no wiggle room. It doesn't depend on looking at any data, you can do the experiments to confirm it in your kitchen if it's reasonably well equipped. We burn everything and the best case is half the world's population has to move or die. Worst case everything dies. Now are you convinced by the science?

Similar things happen with most theories like evolution or the big bang theory. You're right, the system is complex and so there is still a lot of uncertainty around future forecasts. Over time we will refine our models as we learn more about all the interacting bits and pieces. So far the observations have been in line with predictions: http://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/ProjvsObs.png I'd be happy to discuss the science of climate change but that was not my goal with this video because I thought this audience was already well aware of the science.

Derek; I Iove your channel and have learned so much from it; I assume that the facts presented are well researched and true - however please review the contributions of green house gasses. You claim that most greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the burning of fossil fuels from transportation and energy use. THIS IS UNTRUE. Most green house gas emissions are from METHANE from livestock. Methane is both more abundant of a greenhouse gas (as emitted by human needs) and a more POTENT green house gas. Methane has a MUCH shorter half life than does Carbon Dioxide from burning fossil fuels, about 7 years, as compared to 100 years for methane and CO2 respectively. The best thing that we can do is to limit or abolish factory farming and become vegan. If we do so, we can have a great impact on green house gas contribution to global warming. Please keep on posting your informative videos, but this assumption you&#39;ve stated must stop in order for us to turn this around. ",UCNmh3k_6v2_YBVtnCdMJ_hQ,0,UggFFbusTEPgBHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I should have chosen my words more carefully.  Methane is not more abundant than CO2, rather; humans influence climate change much more via methane than CO2 because methane is 23 times more potent of a greenhouse gas.  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) agriculture is responsible for 18% of the total release of greenhouse gases world-wide (this is more than the whole transportation sector). Cattle-breeding is taking a major factor for these greenhouse gas emissions.   ""According to a 2006 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the meat in our diets causes more greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, and the like to spew into the atmosphere than either transportation or industry"" http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-greenhouse-hamburger/  A cow release between 70-120 kg of Methane per year.  Therefore the release of about 100 kg Methane per year for each cow is equivalent to about 2'300 kg CO2 per year. The same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated by burning 1'000 liters of petrol. With a car using 8 liters of petrol per 100 km, you could drive 12'500 km per year (7'800 miles per year). There are about 1.5 billion cows and bulls, each producing about two billion metric tons of CO2-equivalents per year. In addition, clearing of tropical forests and rain forests to get more grazing land and farm land is responsible for an extra 2.8 billion metric tons of CO2 emission per year! ---- The misconception that transportation and industry , not factory farming,  are the main contributors to climate change is one of the most significant and destructive falicies we've been told.

Developing countries around the world want more power for their citizens and the cheapest form of producing energy is coal. In the coming decades I would expect to see an increase in coal burning and CO2 emissions that would not be offset by more developed nations capturing carbon output. I believe that the only true solution is to develop an energy source that is cheaper than coal so it is in the best economic interests of everyone to use this carbon neutral source. I&#39;m not a huge fan of nuclear as it is today but I am a proponent into research of generation 4 reactors especially ones based on molten salt and the use of thorium as a fuel instead of uranium 235. The properties of such a reactor could dramatically cut cost for development of nuclear facilities and reduce waste products from current nuclear by many orders of magnitude. Plenty of research still needs to be done to get them to commercial level, but China and India and a few other countries are already making these to reduce polution in their countries. There are many videos online that describe all of the benefits that are associated with a thorium based molten salt reactor or Bill Gates and his traveling wave reactor.

If you want your input on the matter to be heard, you&#39;ll have to know heart surgery first.<br /><br />Regarding the evidence, It might be nice and simple to watch a documentary or read a news article, but if you really want to be sure that you&#39;re informed properly, read the scientific literature. If that&#39;s too much to ask (which would be understandable for anyone not in the field themselves), talk to actual experts in the field. Climate scientists! Not politicians, advocates, meteorologists or any other kind of scientists, but actual experts on the climate. <br /><br />Predictions that hasn&#39;t come true boils down to the same issue.

We have the extremist environmentalists who see Human prosperity on the earth as despicable and completely unsustainable, and also the extremist conservatives who simply don&#39;t want to admit there is even a problem.<br /><br />So the question remains, how do we get the cold hard facts to the public rather than the inflated and over exaggerated opinions of the politically, monetarily and self righteously motivated? Lets quit exaggerating the reality of the situation where some claim we will be under water in 20 years time, and also quit ignoring the fact we are contributing to the globes climate change.<br /><br />And I guess my real question for you is, why the hell do we not encourage the use of Nuclear Power? It is our most efficient, environmentally friendly and practical source of energy in this day and age. It emits less ambient radiation than coal power plants, requires less energy to construct than solar and wind farms and has a significantly smaller footprint than the equivalent solar or wind farm (which more often than not are detrimental to local fauna and flora).<br /><br />It really seems like Nuclear Power is to the Greenies that Climate Change is to the Conservatives. There is simply no willingness to have an open mind about how we can tackle the problem, from either side. And that is what truly concerns me. We will get nowhere if there is not compromise, and simply arguing two completely unrealistic opinions and demands will only result in no action, which is what we can&#39;t afford to have.<br /><br />NUCLEAR is the clear cut answer, at this point in time.

The nuclear industry seems to externalise insurance in a way that no other industry can.

It affects the solubility of CO2 in the oceans, which then reflects heat back onto earth's surface. This proves you don't even understand the basic science involved.* *Inconvenient truth? More like a basic part of the science involved that actually proves our point, not debunks it. If temperature change didn't lag, then as almost 90% of the 300GT of CO2 released annually into the atmosphere, comes from the ocean, we would be proven wrong. However, this lag shows something else, the ocean used to absorb CO2, now it doesn't. Our effects are increased by a factor of 10.* *Government gravy?

Communist China, she says, is the best model.&quot; I fear that the goal here is to indoctrinate as many young people as possible in order to have a population of unquestioning individuals that will take climate change for granted and not make their own judgments based on the evidence provided by both sides as I have.

We've observed the size of the holes in the ground and the balance sheets of industry. That matches the increase that we've observed by measuring the CO2 and comparing it with previous measurements or with old stored air. That's an observed fact not a theory. We put the extra CO2 there. The other observable fact is that water vapour and CO2 stops some of the IR leaving the earth. That's a fact that was first observed over a hundred years ago. You can check this yourself in your kitchen with a little bit of equipment. Or you can check it with a pencil and paper, but that's extremely hard. Doable but *very very* hard. Over a hundred years ago we also observed that the temperature of the Earth is about 33 degrees higher than it would be for a body of that albedo at this distance from the sun. You can check the maths yourself, it's not hard. So the globe is warmed compared to what it ""should"" be. That's another observable fact. You can check this by walking outside and seeing if you freeze to death in just a few minutes. The theory (not fact now, this is theory) is that global warming caused by CO2 and water vapour (which currently stands at 33 degrees warmer than normal) will be increased if you increase the amount of CO2 and water vapour. This is based on ""symmetry"". The expectation that if it worked for the first 33 degrees of warming, then the same mechanism will continue higher or lower values. The way to check that is to look at planets that have higher or lower values for GHG. We look at Mars, which has some CO2 but no water and we find that it agrees very well with predictions. It's very cold, so the theory is supported rather than refuted by the evidence. We look at Venus with *lots and lots* of CO2 and we find the same thing. It's temperature is in line with predictions. It's very hot and the theory is supported rather than refuted. Indeed every test of the theory so far supports it. There are *no* observations that disprove the theory. None at all. Sorry to burst your bubble there. So, now that you know the facts we can expect your opinion to change right? That's what science is. First you guess (you guessed that AGW doesn't exist), then you make a prediction based on that guess (you guessed that evidence would be found that refutes AGW) then you check with reality (you've checked now) and if the prediction doesn't match reality then the guess was wrong. (Your prediction doesn't match). It doesn't matter how much you like the guess, how vested you are in the guess being right, how many people with letters after their name agree with the guess, if it doesn't match reality, it's wrong. Recognising that, you'll now change your opinion, or if you don't then you need to face up to the fact that you are the sort of person who will hold a belief despite knowing it to be false. That's not that unusual, but it's often hard to get your head around that you are delusional. Part of the problem of being able to delude yourself into believing things you know to be wrong is that it's not a big step from there to believing that you're not delusional. The tool that you use to fix that problem is in fact the same tool that's broken in the first place.

(nothing like the dramatic change that comes from phases). The energy imbalance measured during the very bottom of that cycle in 2010 was still 0.58 watts more energy was coming from the sun than able to leave via IR light. So no, the effects of the cycles (that you call phases) on the climate are completely swamped by the CO2. I've been following this for over 25 years.

The climate has NEVER been stable, has gone through rapid temperature changes and periods of slower change; but has never been stable. The warming of our planet has been going on since the end of the last mini-ice age. Coastlines and coastal cities have been being swallowed up for thousands of years by rising sea levels. <br /><br />Don&#39;t give the government another excuse for more laws, more agencies, and more taxes. A single volcano puts out more &#39;greenhouse gasses&#39; in one major eruption then we&#39;ve produced since the beginning of humans using fossil fuels. <br /><br />The idea that peer consensus is proof of fact in science is simply not the case, at all, ever. History is rife with examples where peer consensus was wrong and sole voices of reason withstood persecution, jail, and even death, for being right in the face of negative peer review. If he thinks, and he does, that private industries have to gain from there being no anthropomorphic cause to our climate&#39;s change he&#39;s again, incorrect. Private industry will always find a way to make money. All this is going to do is make things more expensive for consumers.

Which research needs to support whatever the latest polls says to help advance the political aims of the people who are paying for it. The career suicide caused by kicking against, what are held to be correct positions, is swift and sure. <br /><br />Good stewardship over our planet, of course. If we all gathered together,and exerted our group effort as a planetary race, we&#39;d not have been able to prevent the last ice age. There is simply not enough of us.

Volcanoes recycle carbon that has fallen to the sea floor and been subducted. It's not new carbon, it's just a very long period carbon cycle. It's exactly equal (in the long term) to the amount of carbon being removed by subduction. Volcanoes add nothing to the amount of carbon in the system. Consensus is a strawman argument. There's plenty of actual science that shows human caused global warming happens. It's based on facts. You can have your own opinion but not your own facts. These are the facts. These are not opinions, they're not up for debate. 1) temperature is a measure of the amount of energy in a system. 2) if energy in equals energy out, the temperature stays the same 3) if energy in is more than energy out the temperature goes up 4) the Earth gets energy in from the sun mostly as visible light, that makes it warm 5) warm things emit energy in the form of infrared light and the warmer they are the more energy they emit. 6) the Earth has heated up until the amount of infrared energy leaving equalled the amount of energy arriving as visible light 7) CO2 blocks infrared light From those facts you can see that if you let energy in as visible light and stop it leaving as infrared, the temperature will go up until it's warm enough that the amount of energy leaving as infrared again equals the amount arriving as visible light. It really is that simple.﻿ The North American fossil fuel industry alone makes 1/4 of a *trillion* dollars per year by digging up carbon and burning it. If you think that they're happy to ""find a[nother] way to make money"" you're an idiot. They will and do fight tooth and nail to protect an income that's larger than most country's GDP Science doesn't work by taking opinion polls and giving the results that the public wants. Doing that is scientific suicide. To do that would require fabricating results. When that was discovered, and it would be, the scientists involved would lose everything. Their job, any chance of another job, any grants. It would be the end of them. Though the fossil fuel lobby often cites this flow of grant money as the reason scientists fabricate results, the reality is the *exact* opposite. Fabricating results would end the flow of grant money, completely and forever. Evolution (by natural selection) has nothing to do with global temperatures. Planetary climate is *not* self correcting and *doesn't* tend toward a habitable environment for humans to enjoy. The climate is a chaotic system that has many strange attractors. (sorry, stable points where it will sit for long periods if dropped there). Venus is an easy example of a different strange attractor for a very similar planet. 3 billion years ago the amount of sunlight Venus received was about the same as Earth gets now. There was no ""self-correction"" that held it to a state similar to Earth's now. CO2 built up and the temperature rose unchecked until the emission of infrared matched the absorption of visible light.

Why do YOU lie to us?<br /><br />Climate change is not an armageddon and it is not invisible gas. Climate change is what was happening all the time ever since any climate on Earth started to exist and all life forms on Earth evolved in a way to cope with it. The CO2 we are releasing to atmosphere now was all in the atmosphere some 400 million years ago. And while humans may have some effect on it at present, there&#39;s nothing like scientific consensus that what will happen as a result will be bad. There&#39;s plenty of scientific research showing that sudden condition change may have very bad effect on many species but there is very little research showing the same over the course of many years - actually large part of such research shows that species are capable of adaptation.<br /><br />Conspiration theories about &quot;vested interests&quot;, &quot;big oil&quot; or &quot;big coal&quot; are another funny part of the folclore.

Ok now for the argument on global warming as result of increased CO2. Humans claim to be the most intelligent so it stands to reason we should adapt by moving our cities inland thus creating an economic boom and creating millions of jobs which will give everyone the chance to adapt to new and practical technologies.

Why not use this principle today obviously the planet will react to higher CO2 levels by creating more plants thus filtering then and brining them down to a mean level.

We are concerned with land ice. This is ice over land, such as parts of the Arctic and Antarctic, and most notably Greenland. When that ice melts, it runs down rivers into the ocean, where it really does increase the sea level, because before melting it wasn't taking up space in the ocean before. Also, I agree, ""the sea will cover most of the arable land"" is garbage. Because it's not what the predictions say for the short term. They say that in the next 100 years, permanent and more frequent temporary flooding will impact all coastal areas. Areas like Bangladesh and Eastern India with all their arable land right near sea level will be dramatically impacted, but the US's arable land will be almost completely unaffected. However, all the cities around the world that are right on the coasts will end up with huge problems with flooding, and they'll have to spend far more money than they probably have in order to protect themselves from almost constant damage.  Because of the measured sea level rises in the last while, Manhattan used to have a 1% chance of flooding every year in the 1850's, but now has a 25% chance of flooding every year. This percentage is not a prediction, this is based on measured data. So it's very much a real thing that way. The world temperature has NOT been going down over the last 10 years, and I can't even imagine where you would have heard that other than from a complete liar. 7 out of 10 of the hottest years on record have been in the last 10 years. The last 10 year period is the warmest 10-year period since records started in the 1800s. The warmest year ever was in 2010, not that long ago. There are small variations year to year that mean even though the overall trend of temperatures is clearly that it is getting hotter and hotter all the time, it doesn't meant that you necessarily get each year warmer than the previous one.

That being said if you can't adapt to the situation at hand what makes you think taxing people will do anything. Obviously Australia thought it was a bogus tax since it was repealed. So obviously that doesn't work, back to the drawing board lets have a reasonable discussion. And come on lets get rid of the complete exaggeration that the sea will cover most of the arable land, that's just absurd. Last time I checked water expands when it is a solid and contracts when a liquid so if anything even if we had marginal flooding it would not be as terrible as you are stating.

We as human individuals are so limited in terms of what we can do or learn, but we are surrounded by a huge network of individuals that collectively know a TONNE. Instead of trying to tap into that vast bank of knowledge by considering areas of scholarly consensus and evaluating any potential biases, most people try to make an informed decision on what they consider to be the main arguments for each and every topic that they interact with. It is very fulfilling and rewarding to learn more about physics, history, economics, politics, etc., and in doing so we can more rapidly find (and better consider) any related scholarly consensus.

Energy arrives on Earth as visible light, passing through the atmosphere almost undiminished. The ground warms up above absolute zero as a result. It then emits IR. When the amount of energy leaving the planet as IR equals the amount arriving as visible the temperature stops rising. If you block the IR from leaving (which CO2 does) then the temperature will go up. While ""Up"" is simple, and certain, how much it will go up is a bit complex if you want an exact amount. The current amount of CO2 and water vapour keeps it 33 degrees higher than it would otherwise be. We've nearly doubled the CO2 and that's also increased the water vapour by about 5%. Naively you'd have to think another 10-20% more than the current 33 degrees. So 3-6 C. However higher temperature means more water vapour. More water vapour might mean more clouds. Low clouds reflect more incoming light while also emitting IR, while high clouds (like Venus) don't emit much IR while allowing some visible light through, effectively decoupling the surface from the negative feedback (of higher surface temperatures meaning more IR emissions). That allows the surface to heat up without any particular blocking point until the emissions reach the visible spectrum. (that's us all dead then) But, do we need an ""exact amount""?

In the 4,5 billion year long history of the earth the climate changed constantly from cold to warm and from warm to cold.<br />700 million years ago the whole planet was covered in ice and the pole caps were so large that they touched each other at the equator. Then, 200 million years ago the polar caps were not only totally gone but plant and animal life on the poles was flourishing because of warm climate on the south and north pole.<br />Today we have 400ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere. You think it is a big deal and danger? Actually 400ppm is very low when you compare the CO2 level of the last million years. In the times of the dinosaurs CO2 was over 1500ppm. And the dinosaurs didn&#39;t get extinct by CO2, as we all know.<br />Of all the CO2 in the atmosphere, only 4% comes from mankind. The other 96% from mother nature. Why exactly and exclusively only our 4% change climate and not the 96% of mother nature, nor the changes of radiation and activity of the sun is considered by our environmentalists as vital ingredients of climate change is a reason why I don&#39;t buy that whole panicking about climate change.<br />If you believe that only humans are responsable for climate change, then make a calculation what should be done and how it effects economy and living.

For a long time the amount of energy being absorbed by the Earth was equal to the amount of energy radiated into space so the temperature of the Earth was constant. Now due to significantly higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, more infrared radiation is trapped on Earth so we are absorbing more energy than we are radiating into space, hence the temperature is increasing.",UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,1,UggJu978QhsAtXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

At the equator. You are so worried about melting icebergs that nothing uses. You should use some of your energy to stop people from cutting down the rainforests. Rainforests convert carbon dioxide to oxygen which helps with global cooling. There have been studies that say plants and trees grow faster next to highways.

If it is colder than it should be in a certain area this is because of “Climate Change”. If it is wetter in another area it is because of “Climate Change”.  If it is hotter anywhere on Earth it’s…. <br />The issue of governments anywhere in the world taxing individuals for using the ONLY means they have to heat their homes, drive to work, cook their food, light their nights, purchase goods to survive or even watch your videos (Dropped the Oxford comma for good measure) is totally over reaching and absurd. <br />The fact that politicians have always seemed to be the main advocates of this issue is very disturbing to me. Governments everywhere have always had the same mentality. If there is a human need let us tax it. How many people pay tax on the food they eat now? On the electricity they use now? On the fuel they need to drive with now? On the goods they buy now?<br />What better way for any government to double dip than to create an issue and re tax on top of the same things they are taxing us for now? If you try to use the argument about taxing “Giant Corporations” and not the individual people then you are ignorant. There is no such thing as corporate taxation. Any additional tax given to any corporation in the world is passed through to the cost of goods or service to the consumer who is purchasing it. This in turn is triple taxation to the people. <br />I do understand that infrared rays come from the sun and warm the surface of the earth. I also understand that this heat can get trapped in the atmosphere and warm the air. This can be felt by anyone. For instance, on a cool fall or winter night if there is solid cloud cover over your area it will be slightly warmer than if it is a totally cloudless night, because the water vapor in the clouds will trap some of the heat in. Water vapor is also agreed upon as one of the “greenhouse gasses” by many top organizations and scientists. The problem here is that water vapor is not a gas. Steam is the true gas form of H2O not water vapor. It only occurs above 212f or 100c. How does this gas occur in our colder atmosphere? There are so many inconsistencies about this topic how are we supposed to believe scientists and government agencies that can’t even get the 3 basic forms of matter right?

Human activity is responsible for about 3%. The story is that this extra 3% is upsetting the delicate balance. If that were true then the atmosphere would be very sensitive to changes in the carbon dioxide content and a runaway condition could and would be expected to be possible. <br /><br />The climate does not care where the carbon dioxide comes from it simply reacts to it. The oceans are one of the great storage mediums of carbon dioxide. Cold water can hold more carbon dioxide in solution than warm water can. When it gets warmer the oceans release more of this gas but this gas is then trapped by trees and other vegetation. There are many other traps and sinks also at work. There has to be because we have not seen run away climate in the past. Again I must restate the climate does not care where the carbon dioxide comes from.<br /><br />It can be argued that many other factors cause warming on a scale needed to affect the climate but the release of carbon dioxide has always happened after the warming in the past. Yes, carbon dioxide is a minor green house gas but it also seems to trigger activity which actually leads to cooling once the concentrations reach a certain level.<br /><br />We do not fully understand how this happens as yet but one of the ways suggested is that because the climate is already warmer when the extra carbon dioxide is released from the oceans that this spurs greater plant growth and with the longer growing seasons this eventually changes the reflectivity index enough to trigger gradual cooling. Again this might only be the result and not the driving force.<br /><br />The main reason for climate change is the total energy input to the system is not constant. Like many things in nature very small changes at the input side can have large changes at the out put. This is why I think that human activity has surely affected the climate but carbon dioxide output is not the major drivers of human influence. Particulants change the amount of energy that gets to the surface. Cities, roads, agriculture have all contributed but how much is under debate. <br /><br />Reasonable methods must be used to reduce contaminants released into the atmosphere but remember nature will still dwarf our activities. Volcanic eruptions spew millions upon millions of tons of contaminants. Under sea vents, eruptions and other massive geological events dwarf our contributions and are not constant but happen at seemingly unpredictable intervals and yet the climate has survived and remained habitable. ",UCHTK06zlvl-rNLfl2MLsCBQ,0,Ugil4yXhT7EObXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

That CO2 doesn't leave the biosphere. When the plant dies and either rots or burns, the CO2 goes back into the air. So plant life can form a sort of ""buffer"" storing some of the carbon for a few years but it doesn't solve the problem. There are actually much larger buffers than plants. Most of the Carbon that we've emitted has been absorbed by the ocean, making it more acid. If we emit carbon until serious problems start, we won't fix them by just stopping emissions because that carbon dissolved in the ocean (and to a much smaller extent in plants) will come back out. We won't have to just deal with the carbon that's in the atmosphere, but also the carbon in these other buffers.",UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA,1,UgjldTS7Utno2HgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

BUT: We are living on a planet whose climate was unstable for the last couple of millennia anyways. So the process we are witnessing is undoubtedly caused significantly by human activity (well, we are living here, and thast is impact enough!), but a huge climate change can be triggered also by volcanic activity or other disastrous natural causes like it was the case in the past. It did happen without us. It will hapenn again. So my question is: Besides our efforts to mimic nature to create energy (using the sunlight, directly or indirectly, with hydro, solar and wind), wouldn&#39;t it be best to use our resources to prepare for a huge change in climate, no matter if caused mainly by humans or not? We should accept that it will happen, andt that we can not prevent it. The question if our part in causing it was 80, 60, or 20 % will not matter then.

If we can - I mean - all processes that are targeted to reduce amount of CO2 whis is given to air and atmosphere is good and needed. But not at all costs - I don&#39;t think that we need to absolutelly BAN coal and fossil fuels as a energy source, just because in combustion process they give CO2. Instead of BANNING all things connected with CO2 (why this gas, CH4 is six time more effective on trapping IR, not to mention freons), why won&#39;t goverment&#39;s make a plan which alow countries to still use engines and fuels which produse CO2?<br />I&#39;m from Poland, my country used carbon as main source of heat and energy since XVIII Century (back in time when Poland was actually part of Austrian Empire, Prussia and Russia). Everything was ok-ish (fine, pollution next to power plants was too high) - since 2000 Poland is getting managed to reduce emision of other poisoness gases and other unwanted stuff, but whole EU still gibber only about CO2.<br />I also want to ask about other thing - how does the CPP (coal power plant) producing ONLY (ok, ideal conditions) H2O to atmosphere? I gotta say, that I&#39;m having a lot of them near the place where I live and difference in count of cloudy days could be easy seen. Most of that water forms as clouds - they doesn&#39;t always bring rain, but they could (and often, they do) cover the sky with their grayscale colours.<br />My opinion is - reducing production of CO2 is good, drawing more attention to old and often broken cars is also good, but I&#39;m afraid that some goverments might become too cocky someday. CO2 isn&#39;t everything and figting with it doesn&#39;t bring ANY effects at all if we still be producing so much other crap. Not only CH4 (hardest to get rid of - any living creature (including us) producing it), but substances that are responsible 4 making smog.<br />And I&#39;m not so certaing if we actually could stop and/or reverse this process - one (normal one, don&#39;t get into limits) volcanic eruption give to the world amount CO2, that is around 10-years production from ALL AROUND the world. Just a medium one - without eartquakes, without making a lot of mess with dust. We have at least few thousands eruptions like this each year - both above and below sea level. And it keeps happening naturally, no one can do a thing about it. Fighting with something you cannot force to behave in your way is like Don Kichot. I don&#39;t think that re-try in this situation will be that funny.<br /><br />One more thing - CO2 prediction are quite old (but I&#39;m not sure).

It is only one point of evidence of the ridiculous claims of Al Gore. I don't think this ""disproves"" climate change, though that may be the intention of the author. Now you say, (essentially) to disregard Al Gore because he is not a scientist. I completely agree. Yet, it isn't scientists that will ultimately make  public policy. It is politicians like Al Gore (who was almost elected president) that ultimately choose and develop public policy. So why would I support some kind of carbon tax, when I have yet to see a major politician even present the argument in its proper scientific context? My point isn't to try to ""disprove"" climate change. I'm not a denier. I'm saying that there isn't any leadership, or policy that can be trusted. My second point would be that there isn't virtually anything we can do to substantially reduce CO2 emissions, when developing countries CO2 emissions are growing exponentially. What happens when Africa joins the global industrialization? I honestly think technology is our only saving grace.",UCGR6Ia6ER_UbUis2b_-93yg,1,Ugh9pAiU675qhXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

He is neither a climate scientist nor does he represent the science in any way. Regarding that Daily Mail article, it makes me sad. It makes me sad that people actually just read the headline, and assume that they are being accurate and telling the truth, and that they don't do a basic google search to find out more about what's actually going on. The actual figures (http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/) show the real pattern. That 2012 was the record low year, hugely below anything ever seen before and well below the expected melt due to the ongoing pattern of ice extent getting less each year. Saying that 2014 has more ice than 2012 does not mean that the overall pattern is wrong -- it means that there was an unusual event, and the overall pattern hasn't yet 'caught up' to causing more melting than that unusual event did. But the overall pattern does not seem to be broken -- sea ice extent numbers are continuing to decrease across the larger timescales (eg the 5 year average). This is like when people complain about getting cold temperatures for a day, and use it to disprove global warming -- the weather of a single day in a single place has almost nothing to do with climate patterns. The small events average out into trends. We don't care about how hot it was last tuesday, we care about what the 20-year trend in temperatures have been, and what will happen if that continues. We don't care about how much ice there was in 2012, we care about the overall trend in sea ice loss, and what will happen if that trend continues. The article is making a mountain out of a molehill. Annual arctic sea ice extent in 2014 is lower than almost any time in history, it's the 4th lowest arctic sea extent ever. A single data point does not make or break a trend. But the Daily Mail article is trying to pretend that it does. ",UCZ2ZRxkzM1bFriJlNNAFKjg,1,Ugh9pAiU675qhXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The act of recycling is reusing materials such as plastic and paper so they do not have to be re-manufactured. So by recycling old material, you are cutting out costs used to make material from scratch. Paper, for example, would require hiring workers to chop down trees, using energy to transport those trees to a manufacturing faculty, where then even MORE energy would be used to process that lumber into the paper we see everyday. Recycling uses energy too, but it&#39;s far less than making the material from scratch.

So you have to take a balanced approach where YES, we need to fund high risk, high payoff stuff like Fusion, but we also need to do stuff that is ready NOW. We can build enough solar and wind capacity to offset new consumption, that much is proven. So what we can do is invest in trying to not make things worse for the time being (eg not increasing carbon output) until the better solutions come along (but the sooner the better).

No one said this was a short-term concern. If you thought that, you misunderstood what was being said. The predictions I was mentioning were the per-decade average increases in temperature and how they match up almost exactly with the IPCC predictions. If those increases continue for another 2 or 3 decades, that's when the more dramatic effects will start to be observed. The increase in flooding however is already happening-- due to the increase in sea level so far, the annual risk of Manhattan being flooded went from less than 1% per year in the 1860s to 20-25% per year now (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL059574/abstract). As this trend continues elsewhere, it will require a huge infrastructure investment, representing a significant portion of the economy and GDP, to prevent continual losses from these more common high-water flooding events caused by sea level rise. So in actuality, even though the scientists weren't predicting widespread flooding so soon, we're already seeing concrete proof that it's beginning to happen, and that the only explanation for it is the increase in sea level. The statistic about Antarctica you heard is misquoted. Antarctica is gaining seasonal SEA ice, that much is true. But it is losing LAND ice much faster than it ever has. Seasonal sea ice comes and goes every year, and doesn't affect sea levels when it melts or freezes, so it's actually of little concern in terms of flooding or climate patterns. What's of greater concern is that the land ice that takes many thousands of years to form is disappearing quicker than ever. In fact, the huge amount of fresh water runoff that goes into the ocean around Antartica due to the melting is what's responsible for the increase in sea ice! The fresh water dilutes the salt water, which raises the freezing level slightly and makes it easier for sea ice to form. Lots more info here: http://www.skepticalscience.com/antarctica-gaining-ice-intermediate.htm Not to mention that other than Antarctic Sea Ice, every other source of ice (Greenland, Arctic Land Ice, Arctic Sea Ice, Glaciers, Antarctic Land Ice) is melting faster than ever before. The 97% consensus figure is based on an assessment of 12,450 journal-published peer-reviewed papers by climate scientists. It's actually 98.1% if you tally it by number of scientists (out of 10,188 scientists). See theconsensusproject.org for details. It has been repeated by several other organizations and analysis as well and they all find approximately 97-98% as the consensus amount. I hadn't heard about the NASA/NOAA thing, so looked it up. This article explains it thoroughly: http://www.geotimes.org/aug07/article.html?id=WebExtra081607_2.html It's sensationalist to claim it was ""manipulating data"", they were applying a correction for an error that was caught. They fixed a mistake. It's not a big deal. In fact, the correction had the effect of reducing the temperatures since 2000, so it served to slightly reduce the amount of warming they were reporting. (And yet the amount they're reporting even after the correction is still way too much to be explained by non-human sources of CO2).",UCZ2ZRxkzM1bFriJlNNAFKjg,1,UgjglmdC5RK-nXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

So their ""doom and gloom"" predictions actually slightly underestimated the warming, and none of their predictions have been out of line (eg outside of confidence intervals) with what has ended up happening in the intervening years. Question: what evidence would you accept as undeniable proof that global warming was produced by humans? Like, whatever you want: what number, or factor, or observation, or confidence interval would it take to convince you that humans are responsible for climate change? Also: How does your money-grubbing climate scientist argument explain the 97% agreement between climate scientists on this issue, even when a large chunk of them are not reliant on funding by university or government grant money, but instead are papers and reports (notably the IPCC) completed by government research departments that have fixed research budgets (not grant-based) such as NASA, NOAA, EPA (and their international equivalents like the UN, ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos, and the environmental, weather, fish and wildlife agencies of just about every developed country on Earth)?",UCZ2ZRxkzM1bFriJlNNAFKjg,1,UgjglmdC5RK-nXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I think you have too much confidence in these climate models. They have history of tweaking the numbers so they fit the collected data better which in other fields of science would be considered VERY bad. Some time ago I watched a debate between two climatologists one thought that it's near certain that humans caused it and the other thought that what humans did might be insignificant. The second guy had many good arguments which really made sense and in my eyes he won the debate even though before watching I thought that he will turn out to be some crazy.

It is merely proven to certain high degree of confidence.  The same is true of man-made global warming. It can never be a scientific fact. It can only be proven to a certain degree of confidence. The question then becomes, if it is a continuous scale between ""unproven"" and ""completely certain"" at what point do you accept it as true, what's your cutoff? Do you accept it as ""true"" or ""proven"" or ""scientific fact"" if there's a 50% chance it's true? 90%? 99%? 99.999%?  Going back to this situation, here's the basis for the claim: if they run a computer model of the climate going back the last 20 years, and include the human contribution to CO2, you end up very closely to what we ended up observing over that last time period. But if you exclude the CO2 emissions of humans, you end up with basically zero temperature increase, which is not what we observe. But both the models and observations have probabilities and confidence intervals and uncertainties associated with them, so it's not a matter of right or wrong. More accurately: the numbers say that when you run the models without the known CO2 emissions from humans (eg if you assume Humans don't cause climate change), then there is only a 1% chance that you end up with the temperature and CO2 increases that we've observed. Or to put it another way: the only possible way to explain the increases in CO2 and temperature that we've seen in the last 20 years is that it was caused by human CO2 emissions, and that we're about 99% confident about that statement. Or to put it in another context: If 99/100 doctors told you that you'd die in the next 5 years if you didn't start a treatment, but 1 doctor said you'd be fine, what would you do?",UCZ2ZRxkzM1bFriJlNNAFKjg,1,Ugh9qDZlTL5qWXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I greatly respect how you are being so communicative with your subscribers.  What troubles me about your response to changing people's minds is that even when talking to people in person, you realized many people have no idea how climate change works, and met people who doubt its existence. You said in the video ""So what I've learned is, people don't know how climate change works and don't know what to do about it.""  Also, you've done videos on way more understood and simpler topics, such as where trees get there mass, where the sun gets its energy, and how insulation works on a piece of ice. It would be greatly informative to the public if you made an entertaining and understandable video on climate change. It could be particularly useful in America, where as of 2014, only 65% of the public believe global warming is happening/will happen within their lifetimes (Gallup poll on Global Warming, 2014).  On policy, major fossil fuel companies don't represent all interests at play when considering the carbon tax, and any tax will be contentious to the public. In fact, energy companies tend to pass on their expenses to the consumer through price increases, which the consumer will pay for due to the inelastic demand on electricity and fossil fuels.  This leads me to my first contention: a carbon tax would be a burden on the public, and therefore on the economy as a whole. Making CO2-emitting energy artificially more expensive drives up the costs of living for everyone, and negatively effects both the consumption and the production of goods in the economy. The carbon tax is also effectively a regressive tax, meaning that poorer individuals are more effected by the increase in energy cost when compared to richer individuals. Other negative effects of the carbon tax includes the fact that there will be administrative costs, which reduces the efficiency of the tax. There is a possibility of tax evasion, where firms hide their carbon emissions as a result of the higher taxes. Production may shift to other countries with lower or no carbon tax. And lastly, the negative externality of CO2 is very difficult to measure, and would make it very hard to determine the correct tax percentage. Instead of supporting a policy which includes all of these negative, unintended consequences, why not support solutions with less drawbacks? Instead of burdening the public with more taxes, how about we give tax credits to those that reduce their carbon emissions. Instead of hurting the economy to try to help drive research and develop of alternative energy sources, we could make R&D prizes to promote innovation. Instead of limiting the energy market to reduce pollution, we could expand the energy market by removing regulatory barriers for deploying new energy production technologies. These are cost effective solutions to reduce CO2 emissions that will also provide the pathway to a permanent solution of alternative clean technology, all without burdening the public through excessive taxation.   In reality, the free market is already coming up with fantastic, new technologies that will replace pollution with cleaner, more efficient energy sources. The more consumers demand cleaner technology, the more producers will attempt to fulfill that demand. More efficient solar panels, better windmills, expansion of nuclear energy, research in fusion and thorium nuclear technologies, hydro power, and geothermal energy are all on the rise, even if the government did nothing about it. I have an optimistic view of the future, because I believe that human ingenuity and innovation will greatly decrease anthropogenic climate change, before it turns into a global disaster.  Thank you again if you find the time to read this comment. I know that it's very long, but it is necessary to get all my points across. ",UCeWY2hd-DfVqh2CgCx0jPNQ,1,UggzC4gCwfEIingCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Afforestation (the opposite of deforestation) is one of the best things we can be doing to slow the rate of global warming. Trees, especially when living in a well functioning ecosystem similar to their natural environment, sequester lots of carbon and produce lots of oxygen. And every area can benefit from a few trees! Cities begin to come alive when you grow a forest in them. Their are hundreds of benefits to planting trees, including more shade and food from fruit trees. I am very interested in permaculture, which is the use of food bearing plants to create landscapes or forests that continually produce food with very little effort involved.  ""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is today""",UCh7cCMuyH_amc6hnbDWdkRA,1,Ugg0jKAz6IqNxHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

It just cycles it. The problem with burning fossil fuels is not that it produces carbon, per se, but that it is reintroducing carbon that has not been in the cycle for millions of years. The last time that carbon was in the air was when the things that produced those fossil fuels, millions of years long dead plants and animals, were alive. And not just that, but that it reintroduces it at a rate many times greater than the rate at which carbon gets naturally sequestered in the Earth. To recap, by burning fossil fuels we're putting carbon dioxide back into the system much faster than the Earth's natural processes can sequester it. This is why, for example, burning biofuels isn't so bad, as the carbon put back into the atmosphere by burning them was taken out of the atmosphere a very short time ago, when the plant that supplied the biofuel was growing.

And don't forget, Arctic ocean s losing ice cover, Scandinavians are already building sea ports for a northern route to China. There are several speculations: winds, currents etc. I suspect, part of it is melting of large glaciers, since they are made of fresh water, which freezes sooner and melts later than salty ocean (there is aprox. 2°C difference or 4, if you sum it both freezing-melting cycle directions), therefore ice cover stays longer, actually it stays whole year and accumulates new layers of freshly frozen ice, so it get's thicker and thicker.

Buy USED items whenever possible, reuse and repair. Stop wasting and throwing away for the sake of getting something new.<br />3. SWITCH bank to a more ethical bank or building society - so the economy is pumped into renewable energy and sustainable industry (and not crap, like weapons!)<br />4. Stop eating cows and drinking their milk. Drink other milk (almond, rice, oat, etc) <br />5. Buy local food - mostly vegetables :) cut down on all meats<br />6. Cycle/walk whenever possible and swap for an electric powered vehicle if you can<br />7. SWITCH energy supplier to a renewable supplier (like ecotricity)<br />8. Get SOLAR PANELS and cut down on energy use - get an efficient boiler, turn things off, use less pointless electronics, install LED lights<br />9.

That&#39;s why we recycle, because it costs less energy to do that than to use dump trucks and smelt bauxite, both of which use copious amounts of CO2.<br /><br />And the biggest problem with climate change is that the left side doesn&#39;t want to acknowledge that climate change is always happening, and that Earth has been warming for the last 15,000 years, and that humans have had virtually nothing to do with the majority of it. We&#39;re merely accelerating an already existing problem. The real problem isn&#39;t &quot;climate change,&quot; the REAL problem is glaciation periods, and how the feedback loop causes them to happen. And we just don&#39;t know for sure what causes glaciation to happen. For all we know, we&#39;re pumping enough CO2 into the atmosphere to stop the next glaciation, which is a VERY good thing. I&#39;d rather not be living under a mile of ice.<br /><br />But no matter what we do, global warming will will happen. We could switch to 100% nuclear, use all electric cars, and kill all the cows and global warming will still happen because it has been for 15,000 years. So why talk about stopping it when that&#39;s impossible? Why not focus, instead, on preparing for it? Rather than using the same old failed arguments, use new ones and give the old ones a rest.

4249,UggWYmRpkhCAM3gCoAEC,0.0,0,2014-08-30 13:35:35,NeonsStyle,"So why does CO2 hold more heat? Well just like anything else, molecules can soak up heat, and CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) can absorb a lot of heat, which is released and re-radiated in all directions, rather than being reflected by the Earths surface out to space. This is very simplified but this is what is going on.<br /><br />Earth has a natural greenhouse effect which keeps our temperatures in a nice comfortable zone. However when you pump in more Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane (comes from animals along with CO2) then the heat capacity of the atmosphere increases, so it can hold on to more heat than it could before, and this is what is the problem of Climate Change. The sources of these greenhouse gases are humans, human activities (cars, factories, power plants etc) as well as the increase in beef production across the planet (specifically developing nations whose people are turning more to beef for food). This increases methane production globally, and again we end up with more greenhouse gases.<br /><br />Doing something about it is difficult, and many countries don&#39;t want to because it&#39;s hard to do, and most solutions require either a new tax, or some form of price to be placed on Carbon, and no one wants prices to rise, so it&#39;s unpopular for governments. However some governments take the matter seriously and are proactive, such as Germany.<br /><br />So what can you do? Driver a smaller car, go hybrid, or drive less. Turn off lights that aren&#39;t being used, turn down the heat a bit, and many other things.<br /><br />As for recycling, recycling does have an impact on climate change, because all those goods that can be recycled, don&#39;t need to have energy injected into production of those items, they can just be transformed, so it&#39;s much cheaper to make.<br /><br />I hope that clears up some of the confusion. Just a note, this is all very simplified, so don&#39;t go on at me that I missed this or that.",UC_WLwlpXVcBzFbSSDTYCBKw,0,UggWYmRpkhCAM3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

It&#39;s natural anyway and ice ages have already happened/ we are a small contribution<br />We have been a large contribution in the last 100 years, much larger than any other source. Whether it is through transportation or the meat industry, we are increasing the rate of climate change exponentially. This is an indisputable fact. Delaying this would bring us many more years without global floods, destroyed cities etc. Simply because there are other sources or it has happened before does nothing to suggest we are not the current major cause.<br /><br />2. Scientists are in a conspiracy<br />If scientists fake a result once, and are found out, they will be rejected from the scientific community. With this in mind, they have to do non partial, non biased studies. It is much harder to fake a trend in data points then it is to fake a statement, such as what politicians do.<br /><br />3.

We have a fleet of 20+ climate-specific satellites circling the globe, which can infer the temperature of the air at various levels, and the surface, and the ocean, from space, 24/7/365, around the world. The technology is similar to those laser temperature gauges you can buy for $20 at your local hardware store, though on a highly sophisticated level. We have a constant stream of global data about air and land and water temperature, air pressure, cloud cover, wildfires, volcanoes, wind and ocean currents, glacier size and thickness, ice mass and ocean ice cover. The data being collected is immense, and it is not flawed. We have a very accurate picture of what is going on-- that's not up for debate, and no well-intentioned scientifically-minded climate skeptic mentions those issues anymore. To further address the heat island effect, if you filter out urban stations and use only isolated rural weather stations, the temperature trends remain unchanged. Also interesting to note that the areas of the globe that have experienced the most warming (according to weather stations) are in Alaska, Greenland, and Russia, where there is essentially no urbanization-- meaning the claim that ""warming is an illusion caused by urban data"" doesn't make sense. A note on this topic about taxes: The climate change discussion has nothing to do with taxes.... You can't argue that AGW isn't real because if it is, we might have another tax to deal with. There is a two step process here: 1) Decide whether AGW is real 2) Decide what to do about it. It seems you might be conflating the two issues, which you have to watch out for. You are very welcome to argue about the merits of the different approaches for #2 (eg voluntary compliance vs carbon tax), but that is independent of #1. The statement ""AGW can't be real, because if it is those damn governments will charge another tax!"" is not a valid line of reasoning. Regarding ""the perfect temperature"": The issue is not the final temperature itself, but the rate of change. Plants and species and humans can easily adapt to a 2C change over a 10,000 year period, similar to the historical cases that you mention: past ice ages and the like. That is not a problem at all. Crank up the temperature of the Earth 5C-- who cares, as long as it happens very slowly. The problem is 2C in 100 years. There will be not enough time for ecosystems to adapt, nor for us humans to be able to rebuild on higher ground when the ocean levels rise, or move out of landslide areas due to increased rainfall, or migrate away from areas that turn into waterless deserts due to extended droughts similar to the type we're now seeing in California (but decades long instead of years long). The economic impact, social impact, and GDP hit of those upheavals and mass migrations and associated infrastructure rebuilding will far surpass any fractional cost added by a carbon tax. We are already seeing insurance companies (whose job it is to forsee such things, because they have 'skin in the game') ramping up to pre-empt these changes (and siding with the climate scientists almost without exception). Never in the past 3 billion years of the Earth, other than during cataclysms like a global winter caused by a supervolcano or asteroid impact, has the rate of heating we're currently experiencing ever happened, according to our best knowledge. It's unprecedented. The ""it's happened before"" argument fails to understand that RATE of change is the key factor and threat, not the overall change. It's also true that the models are not precise. That is because they are probabilistic, and probabilistic models are inaccurate on short time scales and do poorly in predicting individual events. Think of it this way -- I randomly select 20 cards from a pack of cards, and draw one at random. Will a computer be able to predict which suit of card you pick? Of course not. Will it be able to predict a pattern within a few different draws? Of course not. The best you can do is say there's a 1/4 chance of each suit coming up, each time. But, if you look at the past results, you'll be able to tune your model to understand the situation -- that only certain cards are present, so you can figure out the odds of each suit coming up more accurately. You still can't predict the outcome of a single draw, but over thousands or millions of observations, the model will be able to predict extremely accurately the overall pattern-- that each suit will appear in proportion to how many cards of those suit are in the subset of cards.  Climate is similar, in that you can create models that are accurate on broad scales, but do terribly at predicting individual events (eg ""How many hurricanes will there be this September""). Climate is much more complex of course, but you end up with probability ranges and confidence intervals that are still very much useful. For example, in the first 1990 IPCC report, their models predicted a warming of 0.2C per decade. What did it end up being? 0.15C per decade. Not great, but not far off. For the second 1995 IPCC report, they predicted 0.14C/decade. For the 2001 IPCC report, they estimated 0.16C/decade.  It's not 100% accurate, but they are well within the confidence intervals of the predictions. Each successive report has tightened the constraints of the predictions as climate scientists have tried very hard to reduce the uncertainties in those predictions. Ironically, because of the probabilistic nature, your statement about us not understanding global effects while understanding local effects well is backwards. Weather prediction is hard: you require knowing about every single air current and layer and its temperature and humidity and pressure and wind direction to make an accurate prediction. For the whole of the Earth, things average out, making predictions and understanding it far easier. Big picture is easy; small scale is hard. Somewhat counterintuitive, but it makes sense once you understand how statistics and science and the climate works. People like me think this issue is important not because we want to feel good about doing something good, and it has f-- all to do with riding bikes. We think its important because every shred of evidence collected so far, and every scientist who is involved in the field and peripheral fields, insist on the same conclusion: that we are setting ourselves up for an economic and social situation that will be almost impossible to recover from for our children and grandchildren, and the longer we put off action, the more difficult it will be for them. If you want to accuse us of some selfish or self-serving intent, it is probably because we want to be on the right side of history, the side that saw this coming and wanted to do something about it.",UCZ2ZRxkzM1bFriJlNNAFKjg,1,Ugg51fP4HOCLWHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

We should start preparing for the worst than argue about the causes and end up regretting not doing anything in the first place. You may choose to believe whatever you like. It doesn&#39;t matter. The only thing that matters is the consequences which we should try to reduce and unfortunately we are not doing much to do so.

However, it&#39;s better they do so because they are influencing people to do things that will avoid any of the consequences that are coming.

Look up statistics on US retirement fund savings: Average savings of a 60 year old: $49,000. Total savings needed at age 60 to support 20 years of income at $2000/month (minimum wage equivalent): $333,000 Additional average cost of healthcare alone over the course of age 65-85: $215,000 The problem arises when these people end up below the poverty line. Do you let them go homeless and die? No, not in a civilized society you don't, so we have old age pensions and social security. Which everyone else pays for as part of their taxes -- up to 40% of US taxes go towards paying for old people's expenses and medical costs, which if you pay 30% income tax, works out to 13% of your annual income paying for poor old people who didn't save enough for retirement. If you instead forced people to save enough for retirement, it saves everyone money, including you. Think about it: Would you rather be forced to spend 9% on yourself and be assured of a comfortable retirement, or spend 13% on others and not get anything in return?

Removing that responsibility because some people (yes people in the government) think the rest of the public can't says lots about the thought processes of the people in government. When you remove responsibility from people they act like those who don't have any - like children. Here in the UK there has been a debate that removing the requirement to have a pension annuity would lead to everyone suddenly spending all their pension pot in one go. See http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26666103 The argument goes that by forcing people to have an annuity ensures that no one loses out. Except they do because it's the pension companies who win, not the pensioner. Pensioners lose out because they do not get a good deal on their annuities. Yes, you'll get the odd person who can't handle the sudden influx of their pension money, but the vast majority of people will look after themselves. That's been proven many times over. Having the attitude that we need laws like pension annuities and pension top ups to protect everyone is like punishing the whole class because a single person misbehaves. If the government is working collectively to make our future better for us don't you think that the public can work collectively to make their own future better for themselves. It's the same groups of beings making the decisions - humans. Look at it like a free market.

The scientist group I mentioned before found out that the higher amount of cosmic radiation lead to a higher amount of condensation nuclei in the atmosphere, which automatically leads to higher amounts of clouds. And they finally are the cause for higher temperatures (The point where greenhouse effect kicks in).

You cannot even meet the increase of energy each year by solar and wind power so how do you want to get rid of the use of coal oil and gas? ",UCb7A1zWdSArTCw45-edhx_w,1,Ughf4-QetEKTUXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Paper can be used as bio-fuel, for example, while it is rather expensive to recycle. If the paper comes from a sustainable source, the burning of the paper is offset by the growing of a new tree that binds the carbon.  All in all, the effects of recycling is rather negligible when it comes to CO2 emissions. Energy and transport is what really matters. When we burn oil or coal for energy and transport, that carbon we just put in the air isn't going away for thousands if not millions of years.   Not to say that recycling is unimportant, but it matters for different reasons. We have a finite amount of resources in our planet, and recycling is vital if we want a sustainable society. ",UCMnLx0v20ioyTVtloCDIkVw,1,Ugh59-oeBUiImXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The main reason for recycling is that you don't need as much new resources, don't need as many landfills and in some cases, it's cheaper. The aluminium can is a good example. It's cheaper to melt down old cans to make new ones. The other way is to use bauxite that you, with the Bayer process, turns to aluminium oxide and then melt the aluminium oxide and with the help of electrolysis produce aluminium. If the electricity is clean (say, by hydropower) then you don't emit much greenhouse gases (even if it may be bad for the environment in other ways).

If you have not heard what I&#39;m about to lay down to you, just stick with me and look into it further.<br />We are living in the end times, the signs are here that are spoken of in the Holy Bible.<br /><br />And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for divine appointments (moed), and for days, and years: -Genesis <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx9tvCrvv8&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a><br /><br />The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terriblee day of the LORD come. -Joel <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx9tvCrvv8&amp;t=2m31s"">2:31</a><br /><br />( Self-proclaimed by the Messiah ) Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: -Matthew <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx9tvCrvv8&amp;t=24m29s"">24:29</a><br /><br /><br />We&#39;re in a Blood moon Tetrad right now, and all these blood moons fall on Jewish (Biblical) feast days (holidays). One might want to look at what has happened in the past on such occasions, where blood moon tetrads came and occurred on biblical holy days.<br />I&#39;ll mention the past two times.<br />-During the 1949-1950 Blood Moon Tetrad, Israel became a nation once more after 2000 years.<br />-The latest Tetrad was 1957-1958 - the Six Day War. Israel recaptures East Jerusalem, their capital city.<br /><br />These heavenly signs go back to at least as far as 162-163 where the Jews and Christians were heavily persecuted and martyred.<br />The Bible is real, everyone. Jesus Christ walked the earth performing miracles in healing the blind, the lame, the sick, among many other great wonders! He died for our sins so that we may live!<br />It&#39;s high time we get our bibles off that shelf where it&#39;s collecting dust, or if we don&#39;t have one, get one.<br />The prophecies spoken of by the Bible are coming true. The signs are there.<br />All countries have now received the Word of God, that&#39;s another sign we&#39;re living in the End Times.<br /><br />And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. -Matthew <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx9tvCrvv8&amp;t=24m14s"">24:14</a><br /><br />Soon, we will not be able to buy or sell goods without the mark of the beast 666 on either our right hands or foreheads (Revelation <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx9tvCrvv8&amp;t=13m15s"">13:15</a>-17). We&#39;re already being prepared to openly accept 666. There are countless of examples. Subliminals are used all over the place, just look for them, you&#39;ll see them. Look here for exposés on 666 symbolism : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2X6mmskhkbS3YstqgwfSzQ/videos"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2X6mmskhkbS3YstqgwfSzQ/videos</a><br />The mark of the beast will be a symbol representing the number of Satan 666. It will look, probably, like a ring made up of 3 6&#39;s. Those that won&#39;t take this on will be killed, it says in the Bible.<br />When all currency goes digital, how will one buy or sell without such a mark once it&#39;s introduced?<br /><br /><br />I commend you for sticking with me, if you&#39;re still reading.

But it is still only at 1,8ppm atm. Water Vapour is only dependent on atmospheric temperature. Higher temperature means H2O(v) rise faster until it comes falls back as water - its only a feedback effect not a independent forcing like solar irradiance, it is dependent. The earth seems to be in balance that is true. But that don't necessary means it will continue forever. But historical we might just have been lucky that right condition appear at the right time. It is very unlikely given current condition that the gulf stream would shut down completely. 1 As mention under the younger dryads the situation were different. The last time it was during a transition between a period of glacier to inter-glacier state. 2 We aren't sure why the gulf stream shut down (or if it even did shut down completely) and caused the temperature to drop significant in northern hemisphere. http://phys.org/news/2013-08-evidence-cosmic-impact-younger-dryas.html This is still work in progress. The link is only to show you that there isn't a clear understanding of what happened.

""Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the ""average weather,"" or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system."" WMO 1 If you just look at the atmospheric warming the you miss the whole picture. ""The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the land surface and the biosphere, and the interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations and human-induced forcings such as the changing composition of the atmosphere and land-use change."" 2 Atmospheric warming only is only 2,3% of the climate system. Of course it is the one we feel so its obvious that most think of this when they think of global warming. The ice will still be at 0 degree when you melt it but you indeed need energy to melt it.

This is because water have a much higher heat capacity then air. More then 800 times depending on a lot of stuff. That means it takes more energy (heat) to increase the temperature of water then it does to do the same for air.  http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/ And today we know that there is where most of the heat is going but this will eventually change and we will see faster atmospheric temperature again.",UC_VZvonP1qpzkP93rl_OwFQ,1,Ughpk0yjyWYvUngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The problem of &quot;not being so good at handling long-term complex problems&quot; applies to politicians as well. Not only that, say that there was a politician with policy A in which the long-term problems were considered, and a politician with policy B where the long-term problems were ignored. If the voter is unable to consider the long-term effects, he would be more likely to vote for policy B. Politicians with knowledge of this would be much more likely to put up a policy similar to B, because there&#39;s where the votes are at.

Surprisingly those periods are overlapping with periods of higher sun&#39;s activity. Scientists also say that today&#39;s sun activity is increasing which might suggest it is rising up the mean temperature of the Earth&#39;s surface. Isn&#39;t the huge nuclear fusion reactor above our heads causing climate changes despite human activity? Isn&#39;t it interesting that up to 72% of green house gases is water vapour? Why then major CO2 emitters like US and China doesnt concern about signing Kyoto protocol? Why European Union allows for CO2 emission limits trading? Isn&#39;t is just good business on CO2 emision restriction? This is only the tip of the iceberg of questions. What&#39;s why my answer is no.

However it is completely false that the solar activity has increase - its the opposite in fact. http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/lya/ ""Surprisingly those periods are overlapping with periods of higher sun's activity."" Nope. You wont get any correlation with just the insolation or just the CO2 levels. The sun gives you the base line and CO2 correlates it. The insolation varies very little in long time scales, CO2 fluctuates more. http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/bas_research/science_briefings/icecorebriefing.php ""Earth's surface.

Yes and it is very stable and cant explain recent warming at all. http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/images/indicators/solar-variability.gif ""Isn't it interesting that up to 72% of green house gases is water vapour?"" It is! However we don't put >35 billion metric ton in the atmosphere. Also the atmosphere can only hold a limited amount of H2O(v) based on the atmospheric temperature.

I also have a BS in physics, an MS in oceanography, and half of a PhD in systems engineering (knock on wood for the timely arrival of the other half)... none of which makes me brilliant, authoritative, or even passably knowledgeable of the relevant facts, but... hear me out.<br /><br />I&#39;ll grant you the basis of your belief. Fine, let&#39;s say the science is sound: and it&#39;s getting hotter and it&#39;s our fault. So... what? Yeah. That&#39;s what I said: so what? If you are shocked, this may indicate you suffer from bipolar politics disorder (don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s common), symptom: blindly assuming that politically charged issues admit of only two mutually exclusive stances. In this case: 1) believe and care, or 2) deny and not care... but - I ask - what about 3) believe and... wonder what&#39;s the big deal!<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love polar bears, penguins, and the sight of glaciers as much as the next guy. But everybody knows that we are in an ice age... Right? OK, maybe not everybody. But the point is that it is generally and scientifically agreed that our planet - geologically speaking - is more often than not, hotter than it was today (and it is August). Our planet is bound to get hotter, whether we help it or not.<br /><br />So, first point. The world isn&#39;t coming to an end, it&#39;s just getting a little hotter a little sooner. Big deal. Our planet has been there before. Many times. For millions of years at a time. With thriving biodiversity, I&#39;m sure. So, again... What&#39;s the big deal? <br /><br />Are we concerned with the loss of habitat of polar bears and penguins? I&#39;m no ecologist, but how densely populated are the poles? Won&#39;t the polar species just migrate north (and south, respectively) as the ice recedes? (And yes, I realize there are many other species involved)<br /><br />In contrast, if you want to be concerned about loss of natural habitat, take a gander at the Amazon basin. At the biodiversity there. At the biodensity there (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a real word... I mean the amount (kilograms let&#39;s say) of living stuff per unit volume) And look at the rate at which THAT is &quot;receding&quot;. THAT worries me.<br /><br />Which leads me to wonder... Wouldn&#39;t global warming lead to an expansion of tropical conditions? More breathing room for all those tropical species losing THEIR homes? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just asking. Because nobody else seems to be.<br /><br />Sure the deserts will grow too, but last time I saw Planet Earth (the BBC series which my wife gave me for my birthday and which I love to watch) they managed to persuade me that the desert was a vibrant ecosystem... probably about as densely occupied as the arctic and Antarctic... So, break even?<br /><br />Finally... yeah, flooding. Loss of habitat for... um, yours truly. Sure most of our cities will be affected. We have this thing for beaches and ports. But that doesn&#39;t necessarily make it an ecological disaster... just an expensive inconvenience for us. Humans. <br /><br />But, like cockroaches and lichen, we&#39;ll manage. And think about the gain in habitat for marine wildlife! Our troubled dolphins, humpbacks, and dugongs. And all those new artificial coral reefs for colorful fish to move into, where colorful people once lived in.<br />",UCYS-JI98VDacCgB_3CqSMvA,0,UggV8xgM6PtEEXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The story of climate change is boring, because as a whole humanity doesn&#39;t see the full effects and consequences. A big problem though with that mentality is, once we do get to a point where we see major consequences, it&#39;ll be far too late. We&#39;re already seeing some effects already, melting glaciers, record extreme weather events on a more frequent basis, etc.<br /><br />The other problem is definitely greed. The biggest, richest, heaviest polluting companies that have the most at risk just simply have not figured out how to make a profit going completely green, there&#39;s nothing in it for them, at the very least they can&#39;t make the same amount of money trying to be even slightly greener (Can you imagine BP having nothing but wind and solar farms instead of being an oil company?).<br /><br />Thus, with these huge companies with a lot of investment in fossil fuels have our governments in their back pockets fighting for them to help them turn a profit.<br /><br />At some point though, as weather events become more and more extreme over the years, it&#39;ll cost us more and more money to recover (look at hurricane Sandy and how it affected the major east coast cities. Those subway systems were never designed to handle that flooding, and it probably cost the city tens of millions just for that problem alone). There will be a point sometime in the future where it&#39;ll cost our country far, far to much to fix our shorelines, to move their cities further inland to habitable lands, to fight the droughts in our farmlands, to be shut down for probably months on end when near ice-age-level snows hit and bring our major cities and transportation industry to a standstill, among other things, than it would be worth it for governments to stick up for big businesses. By then though, again it&#39;ll be too late.<br /><br />That is the narrative that should be spun about climate change. Not the &quot;oh it&#39;ll be the end of the earth!&quot; (which it won&#39;t be, the Earth can survive much more than that... It&#39;ll be the end of LIFE on Earth, especially human life, big difference). Not &quot;your children and children&#39;s children will suffer because of it&quot;. It should be &quot;Your governments will go broke trying to fix all these more frequent and harder hitting weather events around the world.&quot;<br /><br />Money makes things happen in this world folks, as does the threat of losing that money.

This is done because basic scientific research does not have immediate payoffs. These are the types of research that have benefits decades, perhaps several lifetimes later. The government is funded by taxpayers. The taxpayers and the government have a vested interest in the common good, and having good information to plan for the future. Particularly, this has served the United States very well, as it has been a very good place for cutting edge research.  Americans are paying for the research. Americans with a vested interest in future prosperity. Thus, the scientific community has highly compelling data which supports climate change, and the ability to mitigate the future damaging effects by action in the near to mid term.  Legacy is built by knowing what one really wants, over what you want NOW.  The scientific community is built, and staffed by people who are benefitting off the works of people who have long since ended their careers and lives. Scientists are more keenly aware of legacy and the importance of playing the long game, than perhaps any other profession in the world.  Who else are scientists paid by? The work of researchers that laid the path before them. To do that disservice, and seek the short term gain is against the ethos and nature of research, and the community.  Tell me, who do you think pays for researchers to hold an unpopular statement as truth? To be passionate and unrelenting? Its you. Its because researchers care about people, and the future. Even if you claim its wrong, and is misguided, and of malicious intent.  The data never lies. You might disagree with me. or the community. But you look at the data. It never lies. Especially when it is collected from a hundred thousand records. What we are dealing with, is not some mere pittance of truth. It is fact. Facts, unlike truth, is not subjective. It is not care how you feel about it. It merely stands alone.  In the end, what you're making is an adhom attack, attacking the character and motives of the person making the statement. But I notice you don't refute the evidence, or the statement of fact. Can you? Really? because you would be doing the world a huge service by testing the data. That is how science works. By everyone testing the data.  Bring your best game.

I personally think it would be awesome to bring some awareness about methane. I believe that our actions would be more effective if we tried to reduce our methane emissions. Methane captures more radiation than CO2 and it has got a shorter lifespan in the atmosphere, and because of these two, our actions could have a faster positive result. Maybe the conversation could rear it´s head towards the livestock production and how it produces more greenhouse gases than the whole transportation industry. I became vegan because of this and plenty other environmental issues with livestock production. I also try to grow whatever food I can even though I have a small space for it. There are plenty other actions we could take and I would love to hear some other ideas... It would be awesome to shed some light into these things with another great video of yours.

Some years ago there was a Danish scientist who presented a new theory, and he had initial empirical data to back it up (it was regarding high energy particles effect on cloud formation etc). When he presented his data the traditional scientist got quite violent and attacked all his findings because he didn&#39;t comply with THE standard, one book written a few decades earlier that EVERY other climate scientist had as the basis. These attackers where some of the most prominent climate scientists in the world. Now... I have too major problems with this. 1) To not even consider new ideas because they are opposed to your own is not very &quot;scientific&quot;! and 2) The fact that the authority on climate science are allowed to enforce their view and only base it on their own findings and writings is also very unscientific.<br />Also, practically ALL climate data that shows significant change in temperature is very limited in the time scale. To even suggest that you can show any terrestrial trend by presenting data from just a few hundred years is just plain stupid. Add to that the recent headlines that suggest that some institutions have doctored the data so that it will show the desired trend. In science, you should not set out to prove your theory right, but wrong. If you through all testing still arrive at your initial hypothesis, it must be right.

Which is stated to have 80,000 year record. Here is the catch, that claim is based on the notion that once ice forms down there it never ever melts or evaporates. We agree ice can evaporate right? Anyhow, more to my point, the claim of Armageddon is that the polar ice caps will melt. There are two periods where temperatures exceeded current levels and we have reasonable proof that at least the coastline of Antarctica was exposed. That proof is in the map drawn by piri Reis in 1513 ad, in which he states he used other sources to compile this map. Best guess for this time period for the coast line to have been exposed is 1400 - 600 bc. Am I saying the climate is not changing, no, that would be ridiculous. Climate is always changing. My point is, the record stating 400 ppm is unprecedented is based on an incomplete record which is the remnants of unmelted ice that survived two global periods temperature which were much greater than today.

We take this wood and make it into paper. When we throw it into the landfill, it is covered where it will store that same carbon for thousands of years. By recycling, we inhibit the growth of new timber production, which in turn slows carbon sequestration. As it sits, it is not profitable to recycle paper.

One such was of seeing it is to look at sea levels. Over the past 100 years, sea levels have gradually increased, and will continue to increase. Another way to see it is to look at the change in the size of glacial bodies and the ice coverage of the polar ice caps, both are declining in size.<br />What we cannot agree on is the extent at which humans are playing a role in this. Certainly, we are playing some role, whether that role be the impacted, or the one impacting, it is still a role.<br />Technology is reaching a point where we are finally able to fully monitor weather, track changes, and predict future weather events and climate patterns. What we are seeing, and what we can see from information gathered from the past, is that there has been a general increase in temperature, an increase which correlates with an increase in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.<br />Does this mean we are causing it? Not necessarily. Does it mean we should be acting as though we are causing it? Certainly. Why? Because, if we are not the ones causing this climate change, and are merely being driven by factors out of our control, should you look into the past, and investigate the effects climate change has on life in the past, our only hope is to be in control of it, else we face a mass extinction equivalent to the Permian mass extinction.<br />Not only this, but if we are the factor driving the change in climate, it means we have discovered a means of, well, controlling the climate of a planet. We would have the ability to cool planets, to warm them, to shape them in whatever way we deem pertinent. That, would be truly remarkable.<br />The argument now should not be &quot;Is it 90% humans? Is it 10% humans? Is it 40%, 30% 60%?&quot;, no, the argument should be &quot;How are we going to try and fix this?&quot;, because our only hope, is that we are the ones driving this change, else we will simply be another mark in the history of the planet, another fossil to dig out of the ground, another species impacted by the power of nature.",UCbA0YP7zdSq8Ty_KypODCJA,0,UgjoEz9rJ0Yc13gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

There is an inherent fallacy that even if humans were lets say 10% responsible that we shouldn't do anything about it. We are responsible (and this can be accounted) for 100% of our emmissions. To reduce our environmental impact (where CO2 emmissions are a small subset of ""environmental impact"") should be an intrinsic value for a sustainable future: to be more efficient, no matter what the scales of impact are. Now, I do have to add that there is value in the general consensus of the experts in this matter. It is important we review their publications with skepticism, but many skeptics lack the ability to understand the ""science"" and the ""scientific process"" at their cores. I do not have the same means as a climate change expert, to make conclusions and models of the human impact on global warming. Pilots do not have the same means to understand why their aircraft flies (I dont mean to sound condesending on pilots, they are educated about flight mechanics to my understanding, and do know the aircraft they fly well), or how it does so as the group of engineers that designed that aircraft-- but it flies regardless. My point being, is that we need to take these publications seriously to be able to make effective decisions.

I study chemical engineering, and even I have little chances of making a change or contribution, and that is a sad true. The only people who can actually make change are not whiling and will not do it, because it´s against their interests. Who are these people? world leaders, CEOS of big companies related to energy and fossil fuels, like car companies, oil companies, the big wealthy owners (although to be fair we should remember mr gates and his new venture of exploring alternative energy sources)etc. YES, there are SOME meassures being taken, but they have little impact. Take Germany as an example. Germany is perhaps one of the most succesful countries when it comes to applying policies to reduce CO2 emmissions, and has been trying to change their energy matrix since the end of the 1980´s. Germany has sollar panels everywhere, windmills everywhere, they convert their garbage into electricity, they use biodiesel,etc. and thus less than 7% of their electricity comes from renewable sources, and that is THE most succesfull case. If only the car companies started producing affordable electric cars (Which they can, and they already had in some cases like GM´s EV1) the CO2 emissions would reduce drastically( i know about the tesla, but it starts at 50k for a basic model). If only the governments gave more funding to research in alternative energies such as gen IV nuclear reactors, cold fusion, etc. maybe we would have had reached a new revolution in renewable energies.  Those simple , but important, decisions can´t be made by ordinary citizens, all a normal person can do is try to save up energy and resources, and if you live in countries like the US, ask for these options to your government or to the companies.",UCrcTztnhDbpyl2z8ExHViLg,0,Ugh_opqaEIuCg3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Consumers can see the affect more efficient light bulbs have on their electric bill, but the only way consumers can really see benefits of using clean energy is from scientists telling them so. That's why it's harder to motivate many companies to work on renewable energy innovation. Not only are consumers less motivated to support them, but they too have to trust the scientists on the benefits. That's why we need government subsidies or another form of persuasion. And in your light bulb example, it might've been that the relative success encouraged other companies to make their own products, even if the original, government subsidized company wasn't too successful. The same effect could influence a renewable energy industry. With the Solyndra problem, it doesn't mean government sanctions are bad, it's just how the sanctions are implemented. If the government hands $500 million to a company, and just says they should use it on solar, and the CEO runs away with it, that means we just shouldn't give away money without safeguards, not that we should get rid of sanctions altogether. Also, the companies I'm talking about are the big oil, gas and coal companies. The companies working just for renewables are good, but to really change the energy picture we have to motivate the other companies, because if they're making 100 million today, they're not going to give that up for a good cause, even if they only lose 5 million. So, the only way I see to feasibly convert today's economy to renewable energy is to somehow make it more profitable than oil or gas or coal. Although I don't think our economy now can handle it, the only way I can see to do this is through government tax breaks and/or sanctions, or possibly some sort of consumer motivation, which in turn would motivate companies. So it's possible sanctions aren't the way to go, and we just have approach the problem through consumers. The thing is, to catch companies, consumers have to initially be willing to pay more, which is asking a lot for most of the population to do... It's just so hard to make anyone see the future, either money-oriented companies or money-oriented people. Again, the only way I can see is for the forward-looking people (the government) to give money to the money-oriented people (the corporations.) Of course it's a long process; I don't think we could convert dirty energy companies, but we could hopefully supersede them with sanctioned clean-energy corporations in ten years...",UCG_Jyl78Vg1cO0x-tryMO2Q,1,UgjuzYDrVmI-gXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

However, I think we shouldn't be forced by taxes to use them. If companies and people really want things like it, companies will find new sources of energy, things that nobody ever thought of. They might create more efficient and cheap solar panels. That is the best way to invent new things, not by force. Think of any great invention in the past, none of them were forced on people, it was peoples' choice to buy them. When the first car was invented, were taxes imposed on horses because they weren't as good? You might say, well what about the florescent light bulb? Florescent light bulbs were and are subsided. However many people still have regular incandescent light bulbs since they're cheaper and actually in some ways turn out to be better, like the lack of mercury. But without government intervention LED lights have become cheaper and more common now and will continue as people and business build better and cheaper ones. Business and people are much better at inventing and deciding what's best. Many decisions by government haven't been thought out. Imposeing taxes on carbon might not just lead to them building solar. They could move to a different country without the high taxes or many other things that are impossible to see yet. Subsidizing these buissess is a very bad idea, companies will then just follow the subsidizes for the subsidizes. Ever heard of Solyndra? I'll give you the short. Solyndra is a solar company. They were given a $500 million loan plus a $25 million tax break by the government to continue building solar panels. Very soon after, they declared bankruptcy, fired all of their employes(1,100) and the CEO went missing that day. This wouldn't and couldn't have happend if they're weren't any monetary bouneses given to companies to produce solar or ""clean energy."" The only way that's going to happen is if we leave it up to the company to invent better things, this will naturally happen like any other invention. If people want solar, companies will make it. Companies are in it for the money, so if they can make solar cheaper and if people want it, they can make infinitely more money with that than coal power.",UCmaRWXo0NDTlcRGk_NgJE7g,1,UgjuzYDrVmI-gXgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Also, I think governments (if they aren't already) could work against climate change by subsidizing companies who use or create renewable energy, which may even be easier for them then doing R&D themselves.

For starters: to have a solution you first need to know what the problem is... so, what&#39;s the problem? Is the problem the concentration of GHGs in the atm? Perhaps the concentrations themselves are not the problem but some of the consequences derived from this: increasing climactic variability, rising sea level, loss of human life from more extreme weather, biodiversity loss from ecosystem changes, etc. If the problem is the concentration themselves then the solutions aren&#39;t &quot;obvious&quot; since any solution [even the most extremely successful ones: no more meat production, no more driving!] would not have a noticeable effect for decades and in the meantime we&#39;re left with all these other issues associated with climate change to deal with. If, on the other hand, the ACTUAL problem is not the GHGs concentrations but all the consequences then the solutions are ALSO not obvious since science can&#39;t tell what is good/bad, right/wrong in these situations. Finding a solution is about risk management and that is not a scientific solution, it&#39;s a social one. That&#39;s extremely unfortunate because 1) it&#39;s makes it SO FREAKING difficult for people to agree, 2) it makes humans responsible for doing things like valuing the life of plants, animals, etc. to try to figure out how much risk is too much risk.  <br /><br />I agree that just because it&#39;s a complicated situation we&#39;re not excused from inaction or ambivalence (Australia: no backsies!) but I do believe that if you&#39;re going to do an informational video then at least you should make sure that the information communicated is right: you got the science part down pat, not so much the political side of things. ",UCIvif5vHdv7liWs4ogG-V6A,0,UgjVySBZUNY943gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

There may be any number of reasons for this, it doesn&#39;t make them bad people, it just doesn&#39;t make them very convincing. I grew up in a &quot;climate change skeptic&quot; household, so I got exposed to that side of the story from an early age, including a good deal of propaganda, both obvious and subtle. As I got older, I began to warm up (harr harr) to the idea that there were two sides to this story and that I might be wrong. However, despite looking for answers and being entirely willing to be convinced, I haven&#39;t yet.<br /><br />I am not a climatologist, and this means I can&#39;t use my own expertise in the are to come to a conclusion about the subject, but I should be able to use expertise in my own field as a &quot;subject matter depth gauge&quot; to help me avoid Dunning-Kruger, and maintain patience and respect for those who are SMEs in relevant fields. They are, after all, the ones who have something to teach me.<br /><br />Even so, in searching I&#39;ve heard and seen very little but &quot;there&#39;s a scientific consensus&quot;, &quot;anything that contradicts it is made up by big oil, etc&quot;, and similar statements that seek to shut down my investigation, instead of giving me real answers or directing me to sources that could help tip the scale. Now, there may be very good reasons for this, chief among them that climate change proponents may be just dog tired of answering the same questions over and over.<br /><br />We have your video, where you provide little explanation, frame people on the street as ignorant (they may be, but doing so comes very close to mockery), and then express frustration that there&#39;s contention about the subject. That&#39;s fine, especially if you&#39;ve explained yourself breathless, but whom will it convince? For me, I find it difficult to play ball with this, and much as I may want to, I can&#39;t change my mind based on it.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t to say I&#39;ve never seen any convincing evidence that climate change is real, this video in particular is probably the single strongest piece of evidence I&#39;ve seen either way: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yze1YAz_LYM&amp;list=FLnamAXbyUg1naET1N597Zeg&amp;index=54"">Dan Britt - Orbits and Ice Ages: The History of Climate</a> However, it alone isn&#39;t enough to convince me (though it&#39;s a very good start).<br /><br />So that&#39;s my advice, I guess. If you want to convince those who are willing to listen, you have to come to their table and meet them on their terms. If you claim there&#39;s a consensus, demonstrate it and be ready to counter any concerns they might have (e.g., the claim that the &quot;consensus&quot; is made up a large number of non-SME&#39;s with irrelevant doctorates, such as MDs. Strange as it may be, and wrong as this claim may be, I&#39;ve never seen it satisfactorily addressed by the other side).<br /><br />Maybe I&#39;ve been talking to the wrong people or looking in the wrong places. Maybe the evidence is everywhere and I am just a bizarre exception who hasn&#39;t been exposed to it. Great!

I feel like the climate is such an overwhelmingly complex system, that caution in ascribing causes and effects is the better part of valor at this point. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m no fan of fossil fuels, or internal combustion engines; I&#39;m really looking forward to - and it seems to be hustling right along - when solar panels get cheap enough that distributed rooftop solar puts electric monopolies out of business. However, the great confidence some have in the veracity of this narrative appears unseemly - especially for scientists - given the amount of knowledge we have about the climate. And if we do have really good reason for believing our carbon emissions are causing global warming, why is that a threat to the planet? Is the argument that Earth will become like Venus with it&#39;s runaway greenhouse problem? Or is it just that things will change? Because if that&#39;s the worry, it seems pretty minor to me. The earth will continue on, and so will life, and so, almost certainly, will our civilization. Isn&#39;t it true that before we had a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, there was a carbon dioxide-water vapor atmosphere, and it was the waste products of newly formed life that produced the oxygen in the atmosphere now?

However, if you drastically increase man-made emissions, which is what it actually sounds like, the level of compensation would not compensate to the same degree. You actually even named the principle in chemistry that gives me that impression. Le Chatelier's principle says that when a change occurs to a system in equilibrium, the systems changes to counteract the original change. It's only when you really push the system, rather than nudging it, that it really falls apart.",UCZmEYGgUP3klaiETg02FIQw,1,Ugh6pELetfxU5ngCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Not likely. &quot;1.5-2-7 deg C&quot; (notice no time parameter (how many years it will take) or CO2 concentration required to give to qualify his comment. (CO2 of 570 ppm will cause Temp rise of 1.2 Deg C without any forcing. Expect that in 70-80 years. If positive forcing (the theory behind the invalidated climate models) then temp will raise more in the next 70-100 years (that&#39;s the 1.5-2.7 deg C) but those theories are now disproven by failure to predict past temp changes, and failure to predict the lack of global temp change for the past 17.5 years.<br />More likely forcing is negative or neutral. If so then increased CO2 will produce more clouds (increasing Earth&#39;s albedo-reflecting sunlight back out into space), perhaps more rain, much more rapid plant growth and little other change. That happens to be consistent with the lack of temperature change the past 17-18 years by satellite and weather balloon sampling of the troposphere. Oh yeah, the government researchers who get paid the worse they make &quot;Climate Change&quot; sound will not get paid nearly as much.<br />Clearly Veritasium needs to spend some time learning more of the facts.

In any case, the surface activity fluctuates over an 11 year cycle, and we clearly don't have a similar climactic cycle that follows it, so the effect of the Solar (magnetic/sunspot) cycle can't be huge.

It’s true - and since CO2 accounts for .5% of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - it would be interesting to actually know what the #1 greenhouse gas is - most couldn’t tell you cause they’ve never done any research into the matter - instead what they do is “parrot” what they’ve been told. - it’s funny how the so called debate always uses the buzzwords “deniers” of climate change. I do not deny the climate is changing - I do however question the fact that these so called quasi-scientific opinions claim it is due to “man made climate change” - there’s a difference - those who believe that CO2 which accounts for .5% of the actual greenhouse gases (of which the man made portion is yet a fraction of that number) cannot even tell you / me what the number one greenhouse gas is - lol - just shows you how much research they have done - once they figure that out - please - please tell me - what you plan do do about that ! Answer this then - the last time CO2 levels were this high was before man entered the picture - scientists estimate between 800,000 and 15 million years ago (quite a spread) - now at that time they have determined the temperature was 11 degrees hotter than it is now - OK follow me here - if the dreaded feedback loop was “operational” back then it should have fed-back creating higher and higher temperatures but it didn’t. Trouble with the argument is CO2 isn’t the only factor nor is it the deciding factor when it comes to global weather. Instead of being concerned with the real and present dangers of pollution of our land and oceans - #1 being nuclear leaks contamination and storage we have been fed another red (glowing in this case) herring.

That's what makes a single cure for the common cold so difficult. Of course cancer is much more important but the principle is the same. And yes that's what I meant by better targeting- sending nanites in to locate and destroy cancerous cells only. No more giving you heavy metals and poisons processed from a flower that only grows in Madagascar (Vincristine). We rake the rain forests and oceans for new drugs all the time. Knock the patient down until he's close to death from infection, then let him recover. Then repeat. Targeting is indeed the answer. But I feel you're not considering the exponential growth. Not 500 years, we're only decades away from Nano Tech. People like Ray Kurzweil (who has predicted correctly since the 70's and has tons of patents like the keyboards many bands use and the book readers blind people use) say this is all going to start around 2029. He seriously believes he's going to live forever and he's 20yrs older than us. (And richer).

I'm glad your OK now. My Mother died in 2007 because they didn't catch her Cancer until she was already Stage 4. And by then it had spread into her bones. She actually had 7 different types of Cancer. She worked at K-25 in Oak Ridge, TN (A Highly Radiological Area). Me and my Sister got 250 Grand from the Government, but I would gladly give it back for my Mother to be alive. But as for what I use to teach, I always wondered what would be the cure for Cancer. I believe I know. But like you said, Companies make more money to treat a disease than they do for curing a disease. But I think it will be Nano Technology to Cure Cancer. (now this is beyond my expertise, LOL). But if you think about it, Cancer are Cells. Right? And Cancer Cells reproduce into more Cancer Cells. This is how they spread, but you know that. (I learned a lot from the Laborer's union in my instructor classes, but I learned a lot more when my mother got it) I did a lot of research on my own. I looked up every crack pot cure and every Jungle Cure. (I'm a Mommy's Boy). And I'm proud of that. It devastated me when I lost my mother. Then after she Died, I was teaching a class on Asbestoses. (Really Mesothelioma). And I got to thinking, I watch a lot of TV (Science Fiction). But when we do come up with the Nano Technology to make Machines small enough to enter blood stream. That will be the Day we cure Cancer. Think about it. When a Woman gets Breast Cancer, she cuts her Breast Off. (Christina Applegate and Angelina Jolie) Both had this done. Actually they both had cut off both of their breasts yet they only had it in one of them. And that cured them. Had they not done this, it would have spread and got out of control. So I think a Tiny Robot could actually get down small enough to cut out the Cancer and leave the rest of the organ  (Tissue) ok. What do you think? And Yes we are probably 500 Years away from that kind of technology. But we will get there I believe. (Me and You might be long Dead, But it will happen). And yes I get this from TV Shows Like Star Trek and Star Gate SG-1. I got into an argument with a guy on another site one time because we were talking about new discoveries. And My Point was that we are probably Thousands if Not Hundreds of Thousands of Years away from Understanding the Universe and How it was formed. (And I mean to know 100% for Sure how our Universe Started, Not Guessing but Know for sure). And the guy argued with me saying that first we already know, then he said well maybe within 1,000 years. So I said back to him, ""Put it this way, 100,000 years from now if humans are still around do you really think that we humans won't be learning new things about Science, Space, Medical and So On."" He finally admitted sure we will. So I said then there, that proves my point. We are still Hundreds of Thousands of Years from learning certain things. To me that is just common sense. Right? Lastly, I want to add. Say a person has Lung Cancer. Well today they do chemo treatment. (My Mom did this, it's horrible). And what Chemo does is trys to kill the bad cells (Cancer Cells). But it also kills regular cells in the process. Now sometimes Chemo works especially if a patient is only stage 1. They call this Remission. But then sometimes it comes back. The reason is that the Chemo left part of the Cancer Cell in the Lung and over time it reproduces and then grows big enough to see it on a MRI. So then they start over with Chemo again. (My Grandmother went into Remission for 10 Years then it came back and she died of Lung Cancer). But she lived to be 85 years old. My Mom was 61. But if we had the USS Enterprise (LOL) and Nano Bots to enter the body, you could fly it around inside the body and cut it out of your lung and make sure you get every part of it, not leaving anything behind. Maybe I am just dreaming, but like Dr. Kaku said. When a Civilization hits Type 2, then we become immortal. Meaning that No Disease can Kill Humans. Now Yes I know this sounds crazy. (To us today). But then again if you told people 200 years ago you could go from London to New York in 1 Day, they would have locked you in a rubber room. LOL. Also the Last Disease that we cured was Polio.

However, X-rays are merely gamma rays at a lower energy level.

They are indeed considered ""the exact same radiation."" The EM spectrum illustrates it all. Gamma rays are above the ultra violet, above the x-rays, and they get more lethal the higher in energy and wavelength/frequency.

But the human race is going to split off for sure soon. Adapting to Mars gravity and light will cause changes over time that will make them into a distinct subspecies. But also transhumanism already underway will create genetically distinct variations. And as we meld machine with flesh - for example: say, for eg, to use memory chips for total recall and photographic memory throughout your whole life, you need enough adapter cells, ie stem cells. So in that case you'd be genetically altered to use the hardware (extra brain power or limbs or organs). That means your children will also be born with those cells. Bottom line is leaving the planet and not coming back will lead to new subspecies, and just staying here but taking advantage of science that allows you to learn Spanish in your sleep overnight, chemically, (this is a real thing they're working on) will also cause splits in homo sapien sapiens. This is a source of new wars and conflicts however. The Morlocks vs Eloi situation. The movie ""Gattaca"" showed the effect in the early stages; only enhanced people could lead or do science. Everyone else were cops and janitors. That's what happens when you place a cost on being human. These advantages (the Olympics will have to have new categories) must be efficient enough to be offered free of charge, or not at all. As long as we cling to this system of competition and growth, burning through resources as fast as possible (the fastest burners are the richest), then offering enhancements to those who can pay only is as good as forcing it on everyone. If you must have a job to be part of society, but you can't compete for a job because you can't afford the upgrades, you're stuck in catch 22. We really need to start planning and legislating *NOW*.

Meaning if you have a block that is pure Alpha and it's sitting on your desk, you are getting No Radiation from it in your chair. It's when it get attached to Dust then it becomes a Inhale hazard. It's powers disintegrate after just 2 inches. Then you have Beta Radiation which can travel Several Hundred Meters. Yet it can be shielded by something as simple as Plastic. This is why you see the guys in Yellow Suits. But remember suits are not really for protection, they are for contaminants. So you don't spread it to other areas.

And Lastly is Neutron Radiation. This is the Deadliest and it travels the Farthest. It can pass through the Entire Earth. Yet anything with a High Hydrogen Content can weaken it substantially. Think of Shielding more as a Filter than something that completely stops it. And Yes we use Lead Blankets to put on top of Hot-Spots (High Radiation Areas).

What Most people don't understand is that when JFK said we are going to the Moon in this decade, we didn't even come close to the technologies that we have today. And what I mean is ""NOT"" the obvious. Of course our Tech is better today. But what I mean is that we have a better chance of going to Mars Today, than we had to go to the Moon in 1969. But your concerns are 100% accurate. The Major Problem is Radiation. And being a Science Geek (amateur geek, lol), The Radiation Outside our Solar System is at a completely different level than what it is in our Solar System. The same as our Earth creates a magnetic field to block most deadly radiation here on Earth, the same is done by the Sun for Our Solar System. As a Teacher of Radiation, you must use shielding in order to keep yourself safe. And there really is only three different types to worry about (Beta, Gamma & Neutron), these types travel indefinite distances. Alpha is only dangerous if swallowed. Because your own Skin blocks Alpha.   Now with Grav-Plating, sure this is hypothetical. Like I said earlier, we need another Einstein or Isaac Newton to figure this out. But give us a little time. The Human Race I believe like Dr. Kaku does, we are just now starting to reach a stride that we as a species have never hit before in technology. (duh, LOL, but what I mean is that we are going to advance so fast that in 200 years if me and you could see that day, we wouldn't even recognize it as Earth) In 200 Years, Every Bridge, Every Skyscraper that has been built today, Every Road even, will be gone and replaced. Our buildings today are not built to withstand Time like the Pyramids. (Or even Castles). I Hope I live long enough to see Asteroid Mining. Or even a Mars Trip. (I'm 42 Years Old). Yes I retired at 38. (Disabled Vet, incase the Math doesn't work for you. LOL).   So much I want to discuss. LOL. The LHC is one of my Favorite buildings in the World. And right now they are talking about building 1 even bigger. (You do know we have (2) already). So this will help the Human Race so much in learning about our Universe. It could be the Key to GHG's. Maybe we can learn to destroy them at the Atomic Level. Then we could do My Favorite Planet after Earth which is Venus. (Not Mars) Only because Humans could live there without changing our body structures. I weigh 220 lbs here on Earth, Yet on Venus I would weigh 200 lbs. Where on Mars I would weigh 83 lbs. So My body on Venus wouldn't go through any drastic changes where I couldn't come back to Earth. Yet I believe that if I goto Mars and stayed there for 10 years, then I Never could return to Earth. I truly believe My internal Organs would be the first thing to go if I came Back. (any Human after a long period of stay on Earth). Yet on the Other hand, what if we started a New Race of Humans on Mars? What would they be like 200 Years from Now? Of course we don't want to do this to humans. But one thing people here don't understand is that we brought Pigs over from Spain because the Sailors wanted food for when they came back. (And Horses). They ran Free and evolved into Wild Boars. Yes check the Facts, (A lot of people don't know this). But regular Pigs turned into Wild Boars with Tusks in just 500 years. (well maybe sooner I guess). That's pretty quick isn't it? (For an Evolution) So we should do this on Mars. Before we do this with Humans. Or ay Planet we want to invade. LOL.   I could go on and on, but this is getting long so I will end it. LOL. I don't want to give you a book to read. LOL.   BTW - I Blew a 100 Watt Bulb with my Invention, Yesterday. I cranked up the Amps. I used a Box Fan. So I am getting closer. I need to figure out a way to manage my voltage and amps better. I talked to my buddy also. Everything is going well. I'm waiting on Income tax to buy more stuff right now. Maybe by summer (If everything goes well), I will put up a video of my scale model. (Size of half a ping pong table - using a 20 inch box fan). I'll keep you updated on my progress. This scale is my biggest yet. And it's bigger than anything on You Tube. That I have found. My goal on this one is to run an Air compressor. Then run a Generator. Then we will be in Business. *Problem:* To Patent it, I have to build my Generator from scratch. So I downloaded schematics on a generator.

But you were saying about mining the asteroid belt, and that's what this show is all about. The biggest problem we face in reality is radiation. The more shielding you add to protect you, the more secondary radiation is produced _inside_ the living space. Bremsstrahlung radiation. The magnetic boots (which are electro-magnets) are turned off, or down, when you lift your foot inside the boot. So as long as one boot is always pinned you're safe. And with both pinned, it would be like ski boots: you could exert a lot of force from that base so long as the boots are as strongly fitted. Being zero g, momentum is dangerous also. In the first episode two guys are moving a house sized piece of ice easily, but one guy didn't notice the block and it slowly floated past and sheared his arm right off. Back in the station, the argument was to protect the nerve endings to interact with a prosthetic that has touch and heat feedback, the whole 9 yards, or just sever it clean and go back to earth to have it regrown! The stations spin, the ships all accelerate at a constant 9.8 m/s/s (providing perfect gravity in the opposite direction of travel) but ""the belters"" who are always out securing lines and planting charges to bust up rocks and ice, they just used genetics and science to adapt to zero g. I think you over estimate the time to space exploration. We'll be mining the belt within a century. That is assuming climatology is bs (which it's not) so give it 2 centuries. One to fix this world and one to get out there. Maybe the answer to the former will be found in the latter. Regardless, from the start of microprocessors in the 60s through to now we've seen an exponential growth in technology. I wouldn't be surprised if we genetically created an organism that eats GHG's that we could drop in Venus! Like the oil eating bacteria we're playing with for ocean spills. Yes rare earth magnets are very pricey! Good thinking keeping your secrets hidden.

I think we are nowhere near close enough for Permanent Space Living Quarters. I think we could use Moon and Mar's Bases. The Best Base would be on Venus, except for the Heat Issue. But their Gravity is identical to Earth. If we could cool down Venus then we have a second Earth Instantly. But we could be 10,000 Years away from do this. And I believe in 10,000 Years of the Human Race growing in technology, we will be able to Terraform Venus.  We need to build something that eats GHG's. Yes we can't do this today. But I know we will someday. The same I believe we will be able to create artificial Gravity. Then everything we have been talking about won't matter anymore. We could live anywhere and set the gravity to Earth. My Buddy is coming over tomorrow for me to show him what I have got done over the holiday. (His Name is Royce - Expert Carpenter) So I am crunching a quick Fan demonstration for him to take home with him. Instead of Magnets I am making him one with a Crank (Handle). Because I don't want anyone else to see what I really am doing. And Magnets are getting a little expensive. On my Full Size Each Magnet will be about $1,000 a piece.

Very Intelligent but very Weak. I want Star Trek or Star Wars type ships. And I believe if we had an Einstein to Isaac Newton today to work on these problems then they would be settled.

I'm gonna wait before I reply anything too deep so your paragraph to Bruce doesn't get lost. But let me just say this about that vision of the future: if one day miners are marrying and reproducing in space a few months journey from gravity, they wouldn't use magnet boots... Even though the show addresses the bone decalcification in the poor who received ""cheap generic vitamin therapy when they were born"", and genetic alterations to adapt better, if you live in zero g you just walk with your hands. They wouldn't bother with boots, or furniture for that matter. Rooms would have poles cutting across to pull yourself around. They'd start carrying stuff with their toes. A total reversal of limbs. Humans would branch off and start to evolve to have fingers instead of toes: over a million years anyways ; )﻿ Baby's first grasp, not step. Massive upper body. Chimp-like legs and feet.

How the hell does people think it's not real? Don't we teach in elementary school about the different Ice Ages of Earth? That is Climatology !! Doesn't people remember we had a land bridge one time between the American Continent and the Asian Continent? Which was during an Ice Age just around 20,000 Years Ago. The Earth goes through changes and it always has and it always will even if Humans weren't around to exist. And the People that take the side of just ignoring it are really hurting our Future People. They will have less land to live on. When the Oceans Rise, The Land will Not !! New Coast Lines will form and Cities will just go underwater. (Just like in a flood). Now I don't think this will happen overnight, but it will happen. I will have to check out the show ""The Expanse"" it sounds like what I believe in. LOL. Everything I said earlier comes from watching and listening to people like NDT, Dr. Kaku, Lawrence Krauss and Brian Greene. I sit for hours on You Tube watching debates with these guys. I watched a 3 hour debate the other night. I enjoy watching and learning new things. I even watched the Entire Video debate between Bill Nye and Ken Ham. LOL. Now that was funny.

(You would have to filter out the Salt though) Right Now is the Most important time to get highly advanced in technology.. Because we are going to need technologies that we currently don't have, if we want a chance to survive. This I am sure of. But like Dr. Kaku said, ""Today we are advancing in technology as fast as we did in 100 years in just 10 years"". So I guess he means every 10 years now, we advance 100 years in previous time.

Basically we have people working on the same problems around the World at the exact same time. And they share their results with one another.  Remember I don't know everything.

I mean the Higgs is a particle that is 1,000th smaller than a nucleolus part in an atom. (aka: The God particle).

Said ""what if the Transmission started around 2.5 Billion BC, then it quit around 1 Billion BC?"" With that then I said, ""OK, Now I see what your talking about, and I have to admit that I agree 100%"". This is what Dr. Kaku was talking about when a Civilization changes from Level 0 to Level 1. The Very first transition. Where will still have crazy Religious Cults that are basically afraid of Technology. Here on Earth we have Radical Muslims that would rather Die and Kill everyone on Earth than to have a scientist prove that Muhammad isn't a God. When I myself like to try an ease this type of thinking. I tell them, instead of us trying to disprove your God. Why can't we just try and figure out how your God made everything? I myself Never attack peoples religion. This is a Taboo Subject. And I understand this. But to tell me I shouldn't ask questions just keeps the Human Race from advancing technology wise. Now what you mentioned about piping water for people. We have been doing this. The Romans were the Best at this. (Aqueducts). The problem is when we raise the Population, we use more water and deplete entire lakes. I forgot which one in California, but there is a lake in California that is now dropped something like 50 feet since the 1980's. Maybe you know which one I am talking about. Or maybe even Bruce knows which one I am talking about. There are questions I can't answer. Like How Many people can Earth Hold? 50 Billion? I DON'T KNOW?? LOL... This is where we need more scientists, Not less of them. Lastly, I don't understand why we people argue over things that we can control. Why we can't learn from our past. But one thing is for sure, Never in History have we suffered the problems we have today over something as simple as Water. Yet the Solar System has enough Water for All of us if we could figure out a way to get it. NDT said that if you want to become the World's First Trillionaire, then Figure out a way to Mine Asteroids. He said that an Asteroid has more Gold, Silver and Platinum than the Earth has. I guess he means in Solid Form. And a Comet has as much water in it as an Entire Great Lake. This would be a great way to start a New Planet with Life. Take Mars for example. If we heat Up Mars by just a few degrees then could somehow crash a comet on Mars. Life would start. But I am a firm believer that All Life came from a Comet.

Actually the Fan section is the first section that starts the process of compressing air. And it is made into a section for replacement issues (made to be easy). Also much easier when using a borescope to check the fan blades. The second stage (aka: Compressor) is the actual component that is used to get just the right amount of Air mixture for the next section the Combustor section. This is what changes in most all engines. Example on the F404 the compressor section has 7 Stages. Your TF-33 has just 6 stages.

If we're to take the Drake equation and assume 10K intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way, there can't be very many Class 3 civilizations or we'd notice their Dyson Spheres and such. Or maybe not; the galaxy is pretty big, 100,000 light years across. Homo Sapiens have only been walking around for 100,000 years (and only harnessed electricity ~250ya). Thus, a huge antimatter explosion (or worse) or any tell tale sign of intelligence, could have occurred millennia ago but just hasn't reached us yet. Or it did reach us and pass by while we were coming out of the caves. Mind bending distance, within our own neighborhood. If we run the Drake equation for the Laniakea Supercluster of galaxies then the probabilities of life elsewhere are likely 99.9x...% I see your point about the population explosion, but geothermal can be piped. You don't use the hot sulphur water straight from the earth, you transfer it's heat to our clean filtered water and send it back hot. My point is we don't even try. Iceland has no hot water heaters because they are a small population near available geothermal. But producing bio fuels creates a lot of heat as byproduct. We hardly ever use that heat to warm water. There are pilot projects doing this but with the impending switch to electric vehicles no one is putting a lot of money into creating systems where the grey water from sinks and showers is used to make bio fuels, while the heat is used to warm the water in the first place!

This happened already in the 20th century over Asbestos. Companies hid their findings in the early part of the 20th century due to the fact they were making a killing. Yet they were killing poor people in Africa where most of the Asbestos was mined. I taught Asbestos also in the Laborer's Union. After the Navy I was what they call an Environmental Laborer. I taught what we call the Big Three (Asbestos removal, Radiological Worker II and Hazard Waste Worker). I done this for 10 Years until 2009.

This is Why I am doing what I am doing. So I agree 100% with you. Yes I believe our Government wasted money on the Moon back then. But today I think it would be a good idea to actually build a Base on the moon. I think we need to get down our ideas at a much closer place than Mars. So starting with the Moon would be a good way to do this. Plus it's close enough to send a Rescue if needed. If my Idea works, then they could use my idea for power on the moon. (Or Mars for that matter). Also the Moon base would make trips to Mars much cheaper. Launching from Earth costs lots of money. Launching from the moon is much cheaper. In other words 10 trips to the moon, could make 1 trip to Mars. And if Humans want to live forever then we need to colonize other worlds.

You were a ""Do Boy"". You were Not a True Mechanic trying to understand Jet Theory and Avionics. (which have science written all over it). Instead someone told you to replace a Bolt or N2 Compressor Section and you did. You didn't try and understand why the N2 compressor does for the engine. You just knew it was bad and needed replaced. You shouldn't call yourself a true mechanic with the way you explain what you did. See I was taught that a N2 Compressor (Which we named it just a compressor and the N1 we called a Fan), compresses air to get the right amount of air for the next section the Combustion Chamber. It also has left over air to run other parts of the aircraft with highly pressurized air lines. All this makes perfect sense when you are talking about making rank or moving up in Job Position. See our New Guys (E1 - E3's) didn't have down the terms or even cared about how things worked. They were like you, they were told to change something out because it's broken. I on the other hand was an E5 (2nd Class Petty Officer - AD2), So I had to learn everything to make rank. It's like right now with what I am doing with electricity. If all I new was that a Fuse blows and I need to replace it, then I couldn't build what I am building. I have to study an learn everything about Fuses, Wires (and what size has to do with current), capacitors, and everything else that goes along with my idea. So sure I could hire a person and just say things like change this and change that. And they would Never learn a damn thing. (That's You). So now I see that you really don't even have the compassion to learn. I not calling you stupid, I am just saying that you don't care. That is the difference between me and you.

Well let me try and explain part of this to you about Jet Engines needing to know about science. There is much more than unscrewing Bolts. LOL... So Let's put my 5 years up against your 1 month. LOL. I will start with something easy like learning Jet Theory. This is the practice of learning everything from Wing Lift and Propulsion to Bernoulli's Principle and Pascal's Law. So when you said that we don't need to understand why aircraft fly, just that we need to understand that they do fly is complete nonsense. Going by your theory there, you would crash and burn because you don't understand the simple principles that keep your aircraft in the air. See you have to understand Bernoulli's Principle and Pascal's Law to understand how the hydraulics work on an aircraft. This also teaches you about pressure where you don't have to use Fly-By-Wire. Which is like driving a car without Power Steering.  I'm not going to explain everything about Jet Theory because it would take me over an hour to do that. But just even basic things like the science of Corrosion Control are highly needed when working on Jets. Or your Bolts and Aircraft parts would fall apart and you would crash. We use the science of Convergent and Divergent Nozzles for Thrust and airflow. See I was in the US Navy, so I don't know what they taught you in the Air Force. But in the Navy they taught us everything about the aircraft so that we could fully grasp what we are doing. We didn't just turn wrenches. I also helped in the Oil Lab onboard the ships I was on for cross training and due to the fact we didn't have a lot of people with us. We only had 2 people per Jet that were mechanics. I myself was the mechanic on the F/A-18 Hornet. (which used the F404-GE-400 Engine). But I did work on all the engines for cross training. Even the TF-34 which was used on the S-3 Viking. So there was a lot of Math and Science involved being a Jet Engine Mechanic. You mentioned Torque Wrenches (which we did use), but we also used micrometers to install the fan drive shafts to a clearance of 3 thousandths of an inch. Now as for you saying that Aristotle wouldn't care about climatology. I don't get it? He was a Philosopher - aka: lover of wisdom. He wasn't a scientist. What did he try to think about everything? Instead of actually doing the work and experiments? Heck, Leonardo Di Vinci could have been a scientist. He actually invented things that resembled Helicopters. If he just would have had the technology to Power his inventions. There would be no telling how far we would be today. But early man kept us down for way too long. Scientists were killed during the Middle Ages (aka: Dark Ages) for practicing witchcraft or worshipping the Devil. When in reality they were just trying to better the Human Race. It's like Milky said, we just have been in technology for around 400 years. (heck, I could argue that we only have had good technology for around 150 years). And this is why Science changes so much. Because we (human race) are like babies. We still are in our infancy period. Like NDT or Dr. Kaku said, imagine an alien race that is 1 million years more advanced than us. They probably have technology where they can go from London to New York like we go from room to room. (You might think that is a crazy statement) But if Columbus would have told King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella that we will be traveling from Spain to the America's in less than 1 day, they would have locked him up and threw away the Key.

Well It's my understanding there have been efforts to change the Table to a totally different standard. The Table contains, as you know and point out, heaps of information. It's not just atomic numbers and masses, but the way the elements are grouped etc provides abundant predictive info. It's my understanding that the reason academia rejects these ""bigger, badder"" arrangements is because the current Table is the best compromise; you've already pointed out how some science uses other variations (the phlogiston table lol) because it's better suited for a specific purpose. But overall, no one has a better Periodic Table For the Masses. You know, Greg was a jet engine mechanic aboard an aircraft carrier or two. I don't know that a guy can strip and rebuild the highest tech engines in existence if he didn't understand science. You're very philosophical about it all, which I wouldn't have expected. Finally, can you please explain how flight is controversial? I mean, heavier-than-air flight was once extremely controversial but today? Unless you mean controversial because they guzzle thousands of lbs of fossil fuel and spread GHG'S all over the stratosphere then I'm with you! But something tells me that's not what you mean... I think the best date for when science began was 400 years ago, when the Scientific Method was implemented during the Renaissance. Da Vinci and Newton era. Despite the Wiki claim: ""In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word ""science"" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself."" Although Alhazen in 10th century Arabia is often considered the father of the scientific method, he was well ahead of his time. And religious dogma and dynastical monarchs kept holding science back during his time. However Newton probably read Alhazen! So to my mind we're merely a 400yo science culture.

Ventura has done quite a few according to Google. As for causing heart attacks, that is easy to believe. We're bio-electrical beings. Chemicals and electricity. The heart depends on regular pulses of electricity to work (which is why we can keep brain dead bodies alive by forcing air into the lungs with pressure and applying electric current to the heart). If you were able to create a Tesla coil that produces an electric field similar to our biorhythms it could easily disrupt the heart's natural signal and send people into fibrillation - you don't need to stop the heart to kill someone, just causing it to spasm will kill a man. You know those signs ""no pacemakers"" - same idea but rather than interfering with inorganic electronics, the weapon would interfere with the frequency and amplitude of the human body's electrical system. Some people think the Tunguska Event was actually Tesla's giant tower being tested.

Meanwhile California is getting close to choosing between flushing their toilets or powering their hydro. You can always point out anecdotal evidence the earth is actually getting cooler, but I listen to the people who go out to the ice every season and stand in the same spots taking photographs. We've got almost 2 decades of time lapse showing major deflation and disappearance of glaciers we once thought permanent. Weather is freaky: sunny in Moscow while snowing in Rome. But *overall* - how do you ignore a 2% growth or stability of the polar caps? How are you not alarmed that 98% of earth's fresh water is draining into the sea as we speak? The respective winters are not cool enough to keep state sized calves from occurring, while the summers are causing under-ice raging rivers along the bedrock until it hits ocean.

In fact the opposite has occurred over the intervening decades.   Climatologists predicted massive melting of the ice in Antarctica, instead it is accumulating. Last year they mounted a PR campaign to show how badly the ice was melting for ""journalists"" (cheerleaders for socialism) by floating them down to Antarctica to see it for themselves. Their sight seeing ship became frozen in record thick ice and even the ice breakers sent to rescue them at taxpayer expense became stuck in the ice. I believe the ""journalists"" finally had to be helicoptered out.  No science are [sic] not facts. If it were so, then science was only born yesterday since the ""facts"" of yesterday have all become obsolete. Science also is not to be confused with history which is more properly described as a mythical tale of the past told by the politicians of the victorious party. As George Orwell put it: ""who controls the present controls the past. who controls the past controls the future""  The periodic table has replaced the phlogiston tables that preceded it. Transcontinental steam railroads were operated very well on the old phlogiston tables. The quantity of phlogiston present in each type of fuel was a useful scientific explanation that coudl be applied to the problem of how much freight can be hauled what distance and which grade based on the plogiston content of available fuels: white oak, anthracite, bunker oil, etc. The periodic table is no different. It is not a fact, its just a far more useful explanation of natural behavior that will be replaced by something better if we are to make significant advances Therefore neither phlogiston tables nor periodic tables are ""facts"" They are or were provisional placeholders that have or had ""utility"" in their time.

And you space your points so nicely. The prognosis is grim at best when you factor in all the hazards to the ecosystem. But we're limiting this discussion to just the subgroup AGW, correct? Human induced changes to the ecosystem resulting in global warming. Warming is the biggest threat we face but not the only one. But it's consequences of increasing desertification and decreasing food crops and fresh water makes the topic necessarily big and important; and along with that comes scammers and egotists. So let's not get lost, the goal is to _minimize human impact_ on the planet, whether it's warming, cooling, fluctuating predictably or naturally, or w/e. if you feel I'm not troubled by past incorrect predictions then A. Wait a bit, and B. There's money to be made in doing things the right way too. It's just the transition that is the hurdle. If we could start over and design society, it would look *nothing* like the organic evolved patchwork society we have. I couldn't agree more with you about the linguistics, the ""might, could, maybe.. this medicine _might_ cure you"" - A good example is ""if things don't change then x will occur within a century."" What that really says is ""IF we were stupid and all innovation ended today, x will occur."" Population is growing exponentially so they can set their models to the same rate, even though the next generation of cell phone network might take double the power or the engine fuel demand may get carried over into electrical demand. So many variables makes the model easy to gloomify So you see I don't disagree with you on a purely science basics point of view that there is invented bias. But I also think science has a stick up it's ass cos if it walks and talks like a duck... Cos toss them all out? That's ridiculous for 2 reasons: 1. You want to identify the bias and 2. The average of them all follows the reality over a half century, only exaggerated. I don't understand you here: the graph starts in '78 and 37 years later is now, 2015. So how do they converge for 37 years at 0.25° C? The red average line has 2 minor humps before going off into a typical 1/1 slope. The ""realities"" (what are the two colors representing anyway?) hump and bump in time with the average until 1997 where they do not go off into the upward slope. So the graph is telling us that besides having an invented bias since they all erred on the same side, something changed in the period 1997-2015. Didn't you mention satellite issues in the 90's, late 90's perhaps? But more precisely, the internet took off during this time and real-time data and cheaper/better algorithms were put in deeper and higher places around the globe. Alchemy may yet become Newton's biggest contribution. One day not far off we'll have tools to manipulate quarks allowing us to change an UDU proton to a DUD neutron and thereby transform an element. Given time climatology will become a real science. Is it science looking for a lifeboat or you? Cos remember you said an idea has to stand on its own merit: the field is in its infancy even by normal standards. But a branch of science that by definition deals in centuries?

The fact is that there is no truth to any of it. The fact that AGW predictions have never been correct in the past doesn't appear to trouble you at all.   Making guesses at coin tosses and then claiming that almost half of your guesses were correct doesn't mean you are onto something that converges on a usable predictive model at guessing future individual coin tosses.   Furthermore, any claim that contains words like ""might, could, maybe"" etc should be tossed in the wastebasket instantly because these qualifiers render any theory described by using such terms totally meaningless: this medicine ""might"" cure you leaves open the equally possibility that it ""might"" also kill you or simply ""may"" be entirely worthless.   The average coin toss of 100 flips might come up 49 heads and 51 tails but this does not mean that a scientific theory that coins at least partially favor tails has any credence. It only means the result lies within the sampling errors bars of 50/50 probability for the sample.   The fact that all 73 models erred on one side tells us there is an invented bias for overstating claims and legitimate science would toss all of them out as useless; this is not forgivable in the real sciences.  The UAH and RSS data sets DO NOT mimic the 100% failed models, they converge on +0.25 C over 37 years and this small amount simply cannot be attributed to any extant AGW theories, whose error bars are often larger than the predictions themselves i.e. totally useless. Legitimate science is not a ""weltanshauung,"" or in the vernacular a ""world view"" Its is a method of ""testing"" hypotheses of natural behavior and a hypothesis that fails merely once is not useful; it is ""kaput"" or worthless.

What I'm getting at is you're proposing a century long prediction is worthless.

But climatologists can use ice core samples, combined with known geological events such as super volcanoes, to recognize correlations between mean earth temps and atmospheric conditions. They have all kinds of tools and cross-discipline sciences to work with. Another point I'm trying to make is how little spread there is pre 80's compared to today's models. We can't expect a model ran in 1980 to be anything like one run today.

The thin squiggly lines are the outputs of AGW ""models"" not temperature data.   The multiple squiggly thin lines represent the output of 73 different AGW theory models each of which predicted the atmospheric (not that of urban centers) temperature would heat up according to its own squiggly theory . The cost of each of these squiggly lines runs taxpayers anywhere from over one billion dollars to as low as one to two hundred million dollars each (this is big business and it all runs on taxpayers backs). The red line is the average of all the 73 different models that together cost taxpayers as much as the entire lunar landing program yet they have no value to anyone whatsoever either individually of collectively. The Blue and Green lines represent, not what the models incorrectly predicted but what actually occurred. This record was independently collected from both the UAH and RSS data sets of satellite temperature measurements of the same atmosphere. They are universal surveys of the entire Earth that are calibrated for accuracy against another independent means of balloon launched radiosonde temperature data collection.   There was a satellite drift error that occurred in the 90s but this was easily corrected by measuring the period of each of the satellite orbits which indicated precisely the amount of orbital decay of each satellite and from there it was simple inverse-square law correction to account for the precise amount of orbital decay. There is no global warming so the entire AGW theory is wrong (pseudo-science). I agree that carbon dioxide should theoretically warm the planet a little and all of the models use ""positive feedback"" (extremely rare in nature) to amplify this theoretical AGW. The fact that this has not occurred is probably not the lack of understanding of the quantum mechanics as it applies to atmospheric physics as much as it is due to huge misunderstandings of the complexity of our global natural systems.

I am from Tennessee and all my Uncles and Friends worked at the Coal Mines in the Area (around Oliver Springs, TN). I myself joined and went into the Navy back then. But one of my friends Dad, died from Black Lung. He worked in the Coal Mines from the 1950's. Stuck underground in a confined space full of Coal Dust. Now that we can strip mine, people complain about how the Land Looks. I mean Really? They would rather keep the Area looking Nice and Kill Humans !! Yet Oliver Springs was Stripped Mined in the 1980's. And Today it is a beautiful Area, due to the Fact that after all the Coal was taken, the Mining Company replanted Trees to erase any footprint that they had ever been there. Of course this method takes Time and is an Eyesore during it's operation. But it saves Lives. So far the Only good Source is the Hoover Dam. Creates Energy and there is No Pollution. Yet what if the Dam Breaks? It would Kill Millions of People plus all of California (West Coast), and parts of Canada would lose Electricity. Now that would be one hell of a Disaster !! So really what is Safe Energy? I myself am working on an Energy Source to Power My Own Garage. (No it's Not Solar). But My Idea is for another Time. I can already Power a Computer and Television for Free !! I just need to Scale it Up.. I will Patent it if I can power a Garage.

The F/A-18 Hornet is the US Navy's Aircraft. Think of it like this. We have the LX Package (LOL). With all the Bells and Whistles and even the 402 Engine. Of course Now we have the Super Hornet with an F414-GE-400 Engine. But we sell Our Allies a Standard Model F/A-18 Hornet. With the Smaller Engine and Less Bomb and Missile Capabilities. I had to Fix a Jet for the Kuwait Airforce back in 1995. They flew me into Kuwait to fix it. Because I was the Expert on it. And I was right there at the time. Also you're thinking of the F-16 (has 1 Engine) not the F-14 Tomcat. The F-14 has 2 Engines, It use to have the TF-34 Engine (Movie Top Gun), then they changed it to the F110 (Which is an Airforce Engine). Believe me, this is my Expertise. I was one of the Best Mechanics in Lemoore California where the F/A-18 Hornets are From. I was stationed there from 1994 to 1998. But I flew out to catch Ships to go on Deployments. I have been on a total of 3 Aircraft Carriers in my Career in the Navy. (Just 5 Years). But Our F/A-18's are Way better than what we sell everyone else. LOL.!! Again Like I said Ours are the Decked out Versions with Automatics and theirs are Stick Shifts with No AC. LOL.. (My Car Reference).  Lastly, No the USS Nathan James is ""NOT"" a Real Ship. It's a Movie Ship that is based on a Real Destroyer. The Navy Ships Destroyers replaced the Battleships. Due to the Fact of they are Faster (Much Faster) and the Carry More Weapons. Yet Battleships are Better Equipped for Armor and taking a Hit. (Or Punishment). But Battleships Now are Obsolete. The Enemy has Better Torpedo's now a days. So we upgraded to Faster Ships instead of Slow and being a Tank on Water. I finished my Career in the Navy as an E-5 (Or AD2). So if you have any Questions about the Navy, then I'm your man to answer them. Especially anything to do with Aircrafts. (My Specialty - aka, I'm what you call an Expert). LOL !!

Bill Clinton fixed Our Country by doing nothing but cutting Our Military in Half. And my Main Point is Don't Run for President if You Can't handle the Situation and Make the Right Calls. You talk about our Foster Care Problem. My friend in the US Navy made an extra $ 4,000 a Month for his Foster Kids. I myself would Not have a problem fostering a Kid that I personally know for time to get his Mother off Drugs. 1st thing to stop is Celebrities from Adopting children  from other Countries. Then Downsize Our Military and Quit Policing the Entire World. Only Fight when Necessary. Last War I Supported was George Bush Sr. in Desert Storm (1990). That was when Iraq invaded Kuwait with Our Weapons we (Ronald Reagan) Gave Him. We need a president that actually knows how to balance a budget. If Our Income is 10 Billion Every 3 Months, then don't spend 11 Billion. I was onboard 3 Aircraft Carriers. Which takes 1 Million Dollars a Day to Operate. And since 9-11 We have to keep 2 Air Craft Carriers In the Persian Gulf at ALL Times. Plus Each Aircraft Carrier has 2 Nuclear Submarines and 9 Other Ships. (11 Total in Battle Group) This is Where we are wasting The Majority of Our Money. If we cut our Military Budget by Half, then that alone will be enough money to take care of Everyone in the USA for Health Care. Why pay more money for killing people instead of Saving their Lives? We do NOT have to raise Taxes, we just have to use the Money Correctly. We have 330 Million People in the USA. And NOT counting their Taxes on their Paychecks, but counting the Money the USA Receives from Gasoline Taxes, Food Taxes, Clothing Taxes (Sales Tax), Property Taxes (Not just Houses but Cars, Boats, Etc.) We make Billions Everyday as a Nation. And if we don't fix the parents (Or can't fix the Parents), then maybe we can fix the children. And maybe we can use more programs like ""Big Brother"".  Where Adults get children from Orphanages and take them Fishing, Hunting or whatever the area does for Fun and human Growth. I Know What I am saying is ""NOT"" going to be Easy, Fixing Problems Never will be. But it needs to be done for our Future as a society. We need to take care of Children and teach them how to work for a Living instead of selling Drugs for Quick Money. Now I have to go and finish mowing my Yard be back in 2 hours. I hope you reply.

Where they use to give me 6 a Day Plus 90 15's a month. So I know exactly what I'm talking about. They are Legal Drug Dealers that caused Me to Get Addicted a few Years Ago. Now I get just enough to Not Hurt and don't get too many to Kill Myself.

It's Just a lot of People Don't understand that We Know that the Medications we Get don't fix the Problem. My Tissue is ""NOT"" going to Grow Back. It's Gone forever. So All I can do is take a Pill to Block that part of my Brain that says ""I'm in Pain"".

I think that they should have 3 Chances. Also Welfare is for Children. So I think if you fail a Drug Test 3 Times then you should lose your Children. I think that if you are on Welfare and you Fail your First Drug Test, then it's automatically 6 Months Treatment (Out Patient) And you still get to keep your Welfare. But if you fail a 2nd time after the 6 Months, then you should have your Welfare Cut in Half for 6 Months Along with 6 More Months of Treatment (Mostly Out Patient - But one weekend a Month you should have to spend the Weekend in House). Now I hope this would have Everyone Pass, but if they Fail a 3rd Time, Now this is Where I would Take their Children and Put them in Foster Homes and Take ALL their Welfare for 1 Year and the Only way to Get everything Back will be to Pass a Drug Test Every Month for a Year.. And if they do Pass then they can get their Welfare back and their Children Back. If they don't then they can't have anything Back until they complete a Year of Drug Tests and Programs.

If they can do 100K on their own, good on them, but if not their income should never fall below what they earned dodging bullets and IEDs. As I said they earned it. Drug testing welfare civilians is pointless however unless real treatment is offered, which it isn't. Half the people are on welfare *because* they're drug addicts. If you deny them welfare you just increase crimes of desperation and homelessness. (I don't know if you ever skipped a dose of painkillers and went into opiate withdrawal, but I have and it was so awful I too would've stolen ANYTHING to get out of that hell. Luckily I just took my morphine pill and felt better in a couple hours). You cannot get welfare without proof of residency, so it serves to keep people from sleeping on the streets. And if an addict WANTS help, there's often month+ waiting lists for state run minimum requirements treatment. Which is a cot, 3 meals, and talking. No doctors, no cutting edge addiction research and treatments, not even a Valium to sleep off the worst of the withdrawals. It's a pathetic excuse for treatment, that you have to wait 8 weeks for a bed to open up, meanwhile you're stuck with a habit you can't stop taking, and your pimp breathing down your neck. If he hears about your plans to get help he'll frame you to nullify your spot on the wait list. If zero use is a requirement, he only has to hold you down and shoot you up.

I was divorced when my son was 4 years old. So I got my son on Summer Vacations and Every Other Holiday. My Girlfriend before my Fiancé I was with for 2 Years, then caught her cheating on me so I kicked her out. But when we got together she had a Daughter that was 12 years old. And after we broke up I took care of her until she was 18 years old. Yes, She lived with me. Her Mother was a piece of Shit honestly. I even went to Court when she was 16 to get permission for her to live with me. I didn't want anyone to say that a 16 Year Old Girl lived with me (I had a Great Job before I retired). When we went into Child Custody a woman got Me, her mother and her grandmother together and talked to us in a room. At first the woman was mean to me, she asked me ""Who the Hell are You"" (because I wasn't Amber's Father). And that I didn't need to be there. So I just sit back and didn't say a word for awhile. Then after Her mother and the Social Worker got into a heated Fight (Argument), I spoke up. I told the Social Worker the story. I told her that even my Dad said I have a Room at his House if I ever need it. And that WILL be the case for Amber. The Social worker asked why can't Amber live with her Grandmother. I said because her grandmother gets Government Help and lives in an area with No Children Allowed. That she would get evicted if Amber Lives with her. So Now the Social Worker started Liking Me. She said Well Amber ""WILL NOT"" live with her (talking about the mother). Then she asked me to Adopt Amber. I said ""NO"". (because Amber was a little out of control by this time and frankly I didn't want the trouble if she missed school) They aren't going to put me in Jail like they do a lot of Adults because their Kids won't listen. And I told the Social Worker that Amber will be 17 in like a Month or so. So that she only had a Year until she was 18. So they gave me permission with the Judge to have Amber living with me. Instead of sending her to an Orphanage. So in other words, I have raised someone else's Daughter.  And even my current Girlfriend, I have been with her since her youngest kid was 14. And when we first got together I told her that Amber Lives with me. (My Fiancé Becky Hates Amber's Mother) But it wasn't a problem with Amber. So my main reason is because I have 1 Kid with my Genes, and I would like to have 1 more. And we aren't going to get those Fertilization Shots. Those are the people that have 4 or more kids at 1 time. We are just doing 1 egg and my sperm. And if it doesn't take then we are just out $10,000 for nothing. So it's a risk. Also I use to own a Suzuki GSX-R600. It was a bad little machine that I sold because I was going to give it to my step son when he turned 16. But that Bike was way to much for him, so I decided Not to give him a bike that would probably Kill him, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if that happened.",UC5xfc4M1z1sYPnwE-ISXs4Q,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I was at the Local Bar a few years ago and a Good Friend of mine came in. (He is an E-7 in the Army). He is a Republican and I am a Democrat. We always argue Politics when he comes in. And if you didn't know us, you would think that we were going to Fight if you listened to us Argue (LOL). But on this particular Day he brought another Guy with him to the Bar. (Now I hung out at Beer Joints, your typical Run down Bar full of Misfits and Bikers - But some really Good People as Well) Now with the Story: We started with our regular conversations about Politics and we started talking about welfare and Poor People on Welfare having 4 or more kids living off the Government. (getting extra Food stamps - Where A lot of the Families Sell their Food Stamps for $0.50 cents on the Dollar FOR DRUGS) And they know that more Kids gets them more Money. So his friend spoke up and started saying that should be illegal for Poor People to Have Kids. That pissed me Off. (See my Friend Jason, his Sister was the Bar Tender and she has 2 little Daughters) Also she doesn't make a lot of money because the Bar owner pays her $40 per Shift and then she gets her Tips, but a Bar like this Most people don't Tip. So Jason's Friend and I started arguing because I asked him directly, ""So you think that anyone that gets Food Stamps should Not be allowed to Procreate?"" And he said without blinking an Eye ""YES"". The Conversation started getting really heated up. I think he thought I was a Poor Man and was talking about myself. But in reality I was talking about Jason's Sister behind the Bar (And with what I was saying Jason figured it out Quick - But his friend didn't). I forget exactly what he said to me, but it had something to do with ""Am I Leeching off the Government and if so then I am the Problem with everything that is wrong with our Country"". (LOL). I looked at him and Said ""Buddy you don't know me!"" I said that I make Twice his Salary and he better wish on a Star that he can do as well as I do after the Military. That's when I told him I'm ex Military Myself. And I told him that I was talking about Jason's Sister who was working right then. I told him that there are Hard Working People out there that can't make Ends Meat and needs the Money for their Children. Not because they are Leechers, but because here in Tennessee they don't pay a Livable Wage. Then I noticed a Table full of some Drunk Bikers starting to get really pissed off on our conversation. So I told Jason to look over at that Table and he might want to get his buddy out of here before they put him in the Hospital. So Jason Did!!!! So my point wasn't to say that Poor People shouldn't have kids. I myself have 1 Son (like I said Before). To carry on the Family Name (Funny how that is very important to Me and Most others). But on the other hand, I myself am not Starving to death. And if I was and living in an environment (another Country that doesn't help their own), I myself couldn't bring a child in the world to starve to death. I would work hard to get myself in a good financial place, then have Kids. But if your talking about having a lot of Kids (like we did in the USA in the 1800's), To help work the Farm or even get a Job to help their Family. Then I understand that 100%. Most People are Morons here in the USA, and what I mean by that is they think everywhere is just like the USA. They want to say things like ""a 12 Year old Girl working in a Factory in China for $10 a Day is Wrong"". What they don't understand is that maybe in China that little Girl is helping provide for her family and they really need her working. Also in these 3rd world Countries that our Money isn't 1 to 1. (in other words, 1 American Dollar here might be 10 over there). So her $10 a Day might equal $100 here in the USA. That's why I tell people you don't know their situation so you really can't make a decision like that for someone else. Maybe that Family couldn't make it without their 12 Year old Daughter working. Too many people get hung up on Age. These 3rd world Countries to me are Just like the USA before the Industrial Revolution. Sorry so Long, but I could go on even more. I hope you get my point.

In tent cities faith that things will improve is probably all you have, and getting denounced from one's community would be harsh. Then also kids are an advantage when they can work.

Before that I was on the Crew (I was the Forman) that built the New Cooling Tower at X-10 (The HIFER). The old one was made of Wood and needed replaced due to changes in EPA Regulations. A Cooling Tower is basically a Giant Radiator that cools off the water running around the Nuclear Rods themselves, then it is piped out to the Tower where it is pumped to the Top and trickles downs to the bottom of the Base that is the size of an Olympic Size Swimming Pool. Then the water is pumped back into the area containing the Nuclear Rods and the Process repeats itself. In Oak Ridge we made the Uranium Bomb. To make a Nuclear Bomb you must separate U235 from U238. U235 is the Only Weapons Grade Uranium. I myself have my Dad's Old paper Weight. (Which is a 1 Pound Uranium Block - Depleted). Depleted means that the Weapons Grade Uranium was already removed from what I have. But it is still very Radioactive, I used it in Class to teach how to read a Geiger Counter.

Sounds like Candu had many good innovations that led them to become the must-have reactor in the 70's and 80's. Perhaps Gen III took some of these concepts to the next level, like the way each individual Calandria will deform if it gets to hot, reducing criticality, and exposing the fuel to coolant. Chain reaction stops. Yeah the Admiral had his reasons, but it locked in commercial energy production to the same technology they were familiar with. Heavy water low pressure cores have many safety and convenience factors, but high pressure light water reactors were what they knew. My point is all current reactors are children of the cold war era, military designed, and not always the best tool for the job. Candu took a step away from America's norm; partly because we lacked the heavy industry to make the high pressure Calandria, thankfully, cos it led to individually pressurized tubes surrounded by CO2 and susceptible to gravity distortion when too hot! Enabling refueling on the go. Sometimes a negative can be turned into a positive! But the fact still remains that you'd need to cover the entire Sahara in this shit. Miles and miles of reflectors and supposedly decreasing price. In salt based heat distribution, if the salt cools below 400° F it solidifies; putting that entire line out of commission until they open the pipes and knock the salt out. Over hundreds of hectares this can be a problem. Sun farms that use mirrors to direct sunlight onto a tower are easier to maintain, but we're talking hundreds of them on each desert. All to produce far far less power, on sunny days only. Nuclear powers itself up, hidden underground out of sight and protected (and protecting us) and gives Gigawatts of power 365 days a year. For possibly less input capital, I'm not sure on that but startup money is a short sighted method of weighing costs anyway. That's true; if we can all hook up into a global solar/wind/tidal system with nuclear taking up the slack I'm pretty sure there would be no surplus. 3rd world countries are starving for power, and will buy it at a reasonable cost rather than burn coal. They have 50K coal plants because it's all they can do. A little forethought and interconnected nations is what's needed. To save the climate and solve the issue of surplus power coming from our hypothetical zero emissions global electricity production system. If arctic windmills go down in the powerful freezing winds, solar and nuclear takes up the slack. If nuclear is over producing, we can turn off the solar. Tidal is easy to forecast because tides are regular and consistent. I think this varied source planetary electrical production is our best bet. Not too windmills, not covering deserts in mirrors, but also not putting our eggs in one nuke basket. It's by far the incredibly powerful uninterrupted cheap clean source, but married to other green sources we have a chance of meeting demand of the future. I don't see us meeting future demand on green power alone and even if we did it would be everywhere you looked and at the mercy of super storms.

The big thing about the Candu IIRC is that it fails in a manner that safely spreads out the material and gets and keeps it temperature at something that can be withstood without active control.  None of the US designs are that way but they do contain the radioactive materials in the event of a failure.  It is just that the cooling system must remain working.  The reactor for a submarine needed to be small enough to fit in the ship and could be designed to be run by the well trained.  A power plant for electrical power can be twice the size needed and there is little down side.  Solar power is coming down in price as the cells get more efficient and lower cost to make.  The same is happening to wind power.  Nuclear has basically a fixed cost whether you run the plant near full power or at 10% power.  As a result, its price structure will be a lot like that or solar and wind.  It will be very heavy on the initial cost and a lot less on the cost per following KWH. All of the options need an energy storage system to go with them.  An atomic plant comes up to full power rather slowly.  Thus under varying loads, it is likely the power company would shut off the solar if the load gets light.  With a solar panel, opening a switch is all that is needed.  With a nuke plant, you cant suddenly start and stop the reaction so the power must go somewhere when you have extra and must come from somewhere when you have too little.",UCAMNUB4d_oPVJytmtUH3nzw,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Let me check my facts but, In the 80's the heavy water Candu was a leading model that other nations purchased. It can have its fuel rods replaced without shutting the chain reaction down, and in the event of a runaway reaction the fuel tube will kink and break the outer tube, letting coolant rush in. The Russian versions were light water Generation II reactors built in 1977 (with reactor 4 which went supercritical in 1986 built in '83). They were *1950's* designs. The US has the fourth largest uranium deposits in the world so of course they opted for the reactor design that most efficiently uses uranium. Being that there are dozens of designs that all work differently I'll take your word on it that it's in between Canadian and Russian designs. As for the least awful option taken as the starting point for the next design: Firstly one Submarine Admiral choose light water non-breeder designs that worked best on a submarine, in his opinion. This Generation I design was then carried over to energy production in the US and once all the auxiliary industries and uranium mining is in place it's very hard to change over to better systems. Secondly, the Gen III/III+ puts safety and redundancy in place first and builds around that. Which is the opposite attitude prevelant during the cold war, when pure output was the gauge that success was measured. (And when most currently operating reactors were designed and constructed). I can't stress enough the lessons learned, in design, fuels, construction, human error compensation, computer error redundancy, unqualified personnel, inadequate inspections, and much more. As I said, I believe future generations will see nuclear in a light untainted by current incidents that only occurred because these new lessons haven't been implemented (except in the dozen research-only Gen III reactors, and the other dozen commercial Gen III reactors). As for solar and wind, if zero emissions is the ultimate goal, these green technologies cannot possibly provide enough cheap uninterrupted power. Those without will continue to burn coal. Those with will see windmills scarring every vista, except strong arctic and offshore winds no one ever sees, but these are difficult to maintain because of their location. And solar is expensive. For the same cost of covering and maintaining the Sahara and Nevada (for 24hr sunlight) dozens of reactors could be setup for the 60 year lifespan of a reactor core. But don't be fooled, the gap between demand and green is *huge* because solar and wind doesn't really add a significant amount of energy compared to fossil fuel and nuclear- and we currently fill that gap with coal and oil anyway. 1kg of uranium is equal to 50 million barrels of oil. It's extremely efficient, this E=mc^2 law, and with green technology they burn gas to keep up with demand when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing. Without uninterrupted power we'll always have to have backup fossil fuels to prevent brown outs and/or power rotation. And demand just keeps growing. It may be the case that construction, decommissioning, and properly manning reactors makes them ""not so cheap"" as advocates would have us believe, as you said every ton of GG added to the air has long term costs. And 60yrs can pass between construction and decommissioning, that's 60 years worth of power that may drop the cost of nuclear power down to the 'too cheap to meter' classification. ﻿",UCuZkjRk2Cvwh2lo_RSXafjg,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I see solar and wind as likely to provide a significant fraction of the needed power.  It will be lower cost but less certain than the atomic power.  We should just get over the ""too cheap to meter"" thing and admit that the cost of building the plant and the cost of decommissioning combine to make nuclear power more expensive, locally, than hydrocarbon power.  It is only when you include all costs that the comparison makes sense.  Every ton of CO2 added to the air has a long term cost that is external to the power plant.",UCAMNUB4d_oPVJytmtUH3nzw,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I didn't know who to credit, as it's a valid point. Thorium fuel is definitively mentioned in the material I've read, along with spent U237 and plutonium which are attractive since we have a bunch on hand we don't really know what to do with. Breeder reactors are the way to go if we're going to bury the suckers, which I think would go a long way in alleviating fears: worst case scenarios would be contained. The liars would be the money men. We need to trust the world association of nuclear professionals, who design, operate, and inspect reactors. We would need to set it up so the owners of the plants have no leverage over these guys. They'd have to be treated like the captain of a ship: their word is God. But the technology itself is the best proof. Trying to produce a meltdown, by hook or by crook, and being physically unable to do so is a pretty convincing thing. But yeah, there will always be those who don't understand and can't get over it.

Bad designs, improperly maintained and operated, and subjected to the very same weather they are meant to prevent; i.e. super storms from temperature differentials, which are occurring, regardless of the cause. 700 new design (Generation III+/IV) breeder reactors, buried underground in seismicly inert bedrock or salt deposits, could power the whole planet, 1st 2nd and 3rd worlds.

It would take an extreme amount of time to completely turn into solid Core. (Maybe 5 or 6 billions Years - Maybe More). So we kind of need to restart it. I look at it as simple as a fire going out needs more fuel. But in this case needs more heat, the fuel is already there. The thing about Mars is that we don't know what happened to it. We don't know why the same thing didn't happen to Earth. Maybe our Moon was the culprit. (If scientists are right about our Moon). It was the same size of Mars and Hit Earth creating a bigger Earth and a small Moon. But if it would have missed Earth instead of a direct hit, then (like so many NASA Simulations) it theoretically could have ripped away our atmosphere. And without an Atmosphere the Radiation would have boiled away our seas and froze our Earth. This is what we thought happened to Mars. (I know we are ALL still guessing). But our brightest minds are working on this and have been since Einstein's time. Then we get people like Professor Hawking's and Dr. Kaku who with their intelligence just have to go where others left off. Not start from the beginning. We think that raising the temperature of Mars by a few degrees will in turn warm up Mars enough to unthaw the Crust of Mars. Which will unleash CO2 in the Atmosphere an start a chain reaction of a Runaway Greenhouse Effect. This won't happen overnight. But after many generations (A fraction of time in Universal Time Line), the Planet will heat up again. The Oceans will form and nothing but Plant Life will start. (The same thing that Earth Did in Earth's Evolution). The only difference Is that We Humans can do this now. Mars can't do this on it's own. This is all new to all of us. For the first time in Human History we have the Power to transform a Planet. We have even thought about setting off Nuclear Bombs at the Polar Caps. (They will have other elements in the Bomb to help with the Terraforming) Basically Giant CO2 Bombs, like the worst accident that could happen on Earth, we want to do on purpose on Mars. CO2 on the Earth is now at around 200 Parts per Million. I don't know what we need a CO2 level to be at, but it's small like around 5 to 10 parts per Million. But over an Entire Planet that is a lot. But here on Earth we raised the CO2 Level up to 200 Parts from like around 20 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution. And they have found out that the Earth was as Low as 5 parts per Million, Millions of Years Ago. This is where we need to get Mars to. Here is a lot of information on this: http://www.science20.com/robert_inventor/trouble_terraforming_mars-126407. If you have time, It's a Big Read. Last your Moon Theory, about the Trebuchet. Remember that the Counterweight would also be less than you think. You can't take a 1 ton Weight on Earth and use it on your Mars Trebuchet. (1 Ton on Earth 2,204 Pounds is only 365.8 Pounds on the Moon). So I can Bench Press a Ton on the Moon. But anyways, a Rail Gun is the Easiest way to launch stuff in Orbit or even Deep Space. I was thinking about the Moon Lander. If it was on Earth, it probably wouldn't have thrown them up 200 feet. Yet on the Moon it launched them into Orbit.

I still have questions, but I guess none of our theories on Martian history and inner workings are proven yet. Yes the size of the planet determines the core temperature, due to gravity exerting pressure. But that's where the kink lies: Mars is too small to keep the pressure on. Back when it may have been a world with running water it still had heat left over from it's formation process and constant asteroid impacts (as with earth). A molten core provided a proper magnetic field the same way earth does, but due to its smaller size it cooled off over the eons and solidified. As a result solar winds stripped most of the atmosphere away, and radiation began bombarding the surface. The volcanoes went dormant and the tectonics ceased. Ken stated any current magnetosphere is residual EM from the planet's metallic rocks, which obviously wasn't enough to protect the surface from the sun. That's my understanding but I'm open, and I certainly believe in the not very distant future we'll make it livable, and in a few centuries will breathe oxygen atmosphere on it. But radiation will be the biggest problem because of that solid mantle and core. I know there's new theories of a liquid core because the cooling process is a long one, and is still happening. In other words it's cooling from the outside in. Like I said I'm open to being corrected :)﻿",UCuZkjRk2Cvwh2lo_RSXafjg,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I can't tell if that's a typo, with regard to the height of our hypothetical trebuchet. I don't know about building a 1000km apparatus... Dividing the trajectory into vectors isn't really helpful in determining whether the same trebuchet launching the same payload will be different on the moon. At least not to me. Using simple, precise language: on the moon the payload weighs less so it is much easier to throw. However the trebuchet's counterweight weighs equally less, so much less force will be applied into throwing the payload. Ergo, the same trebuchet will throw the same weight, the same distance, regardless of the gravity of the body we place the trebuchet on. On a bigger planet the payload weighs more, but so does the counterweight. That's my assessment anyway. ﻿Edit: Oh I see you do arrive at the same conclusion.

The top most point in its flight is where the gravity has brought the upwards component of the motion to a stop.  This height will be the same on the moon as on the earth if the height is very small compared to the distance to the center of the body.  The 1/6 things cancel. Since we already said the launch is at 45 degrees, we know that the shapes of the paths are the same and the heights at the highest points are the same so the range is also the same.

And an Ocean that would cover Most of the Planet, again just like Earth. Because they said the Water is There, it's just frozen underground.

They'll need something, and even if we say a 50 foot radius on the crew quarters, that's still only 100 feet in diameter. Big but not huge and certainly not undoable. Plus only the crew section needs gravity, and it doesn't have to be a complete ring. Sections can be pressurized for crew, sections can even be removed altogether to save on materials that would be assembled in earth orbit. We don't understand gravity enough to have gravity plating in the works. We're only just now trying to come up with a theory of the force carrying particles responsible for gravity in the Standard Model. And why it's so weak compared to the other 3 forces is a mystery that some are trying to solve using a 4th spatial dimension. I'm way out of my depth even describing the problems, but I think even Dr. Kaku and his optimistic outlook would say gravity plating is something that will not be playing a part in near future space exploration.

And If our Polar Caps go away, then so will Millions of Square Miles of Land. Mostly which is heavily Populated by Humans. England as a Island Country, could be mostly Lost or Entirely Lost depending on the Sea Level. Of course this won't happen in our Life time.

Because if we can create a Runaway Greenhouse on Mars (bad for Earth, good for Mars), Then we as Humans can make Mars Habitable in around 250 years. (And it uses the same scenario as what is happening here on Earth, We need to add CO2 to the atmosphere). Once we raise Mar's Temperature by a few Degrees, Mother Nature will do the rest for us. Same thing happening here on Earth. And once the Ice melts it unlocks even more prehistoric CO2 that is locked in Ice underground on Mars. (Here on Earth the Prehistoric Ice is actually on the Ocean Floor - Most of It). Like I said I have done my research on this for many years (For Mars). I believe within 1,000 years from now we will call Mars a New Home for Humans. (once we figure a way to get us there safely - due to Radiation). (BTW - I was a Rad tech in the Civilian World, then I became an Instructor to train HT Specialists) That's basically Rad Techs to work at Nuclear Plants.

Potential problems with any carbon tax: Production may shift to countries with no or lower carbon taxes. (so called ‘pollution havens’) The cost of administrating the tax may be quite expensive reducing its efficiency. Difficult to know the level of external cost and how much the tax should be. Possibility of tax evasion. Higher taxes may encourage firms to hide carbon emissions. If demand is price inelastic, the tax may have to be very high to reduce demand significantly. In the short term, firms may not feel they have many alternatives. Though other time, demand will become more elastic as more alternatives are generated. Consumers dislike new taxes and often don’t believe that they will be ‘revenue neutral’. This is not an economic argument, but it is a political reality and explains why it is often difficult to implement. A global carbon tax may curtail economic activity in the poor developing world because they can’t afford the small increase in energy costs, but the developed world may simply be able to pay. There may be need for a carbon tax to reflect different abilities to pay.

The solution was to have the people's farm animals rotate where they would graze frequently (essentially) so now it's possible that the Sahara desert might not even be a desert after some decades (or something like that- go watch the video for yourself! It's truly fascinating!).     I really hope that people start to realize that a carbon tax isn't the best answer, nor the only answer out there.  And that it actually might be quite a bad one.  Keep in mind that most of these laws and ideas like the carbon tax come from politicians that are using the law to get *votes* NOT because it's necessarily a GOOD idea.",UCLmPNl1TRhATiXifBsvBGbw,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The ""fetish"" is based on basic physics. Yes water vapour is more abundant and more powerful but it's concentration doesn't change without the warming or cooling of the atmosphere. Thus it cannot cause climate change on it's own. Now there are other GHGs such as methane and it is also increasing due to man. But because it is breaks down to CO2 within a decade it rises less quickly although if certain things happen it could begin to rise faster. There is also CFCs, which are entirely man made but their level is too low to affect climate too much. The other GH gases are not ones with big effects.

Which groups are these? Global warming theory goes back over 100 years and the seminal paper may well have been Plass 1956. If you are trying to say government wants this theory out there (they fund much of the research) then I would have to ask what this is based on? With the overwhelming evidence that's been around for a bit if their real agenda was action then why have they done so little about the problem? The best one can say is they are dragging their feet, You also mention meteorologists a bit. An interesting study recently. It showed that less than half of the meteorologists surveyed were convinced so it is frequently on denier sites. But when you drill into the numbers it get interesting because meteorologists specialize in weather not climate. And when you broke down the meteorologists in the study it turned out that those who had studied and published  on climate were 93% in support of the consensus position. Those who study the topic become more convinced as their expertise grows. Those past super volcanic explosions did lead to increases in temp. In fact when there were similar rises in CO2 levels (only happened this fast a few times) there were also mass extinctions. There would be a drop due to aerosols but that would last for a short time. Aerosols drop out of the atmosphere pretty fast by comparison. Milankovitch cycles are related to CO2 levels because they warm the oceans and that causes CO2 to be emitted. (It can't happen now despite warming oceans because we are putting so much CO2 in the atmosphere that the partial pressures of CO2 keep pushing the CO2 into the ocean. That wasn't true in the past. However as I said before if it were only Milankovitch cycles the temp variations of the last 400,000 years would have been much, much smaller as they aren't that powerful. Speaking of ocean temps here's the data: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Ocean_Heat_Content_(2012).png/400px-Ocean_Heat_Content_(2012).png Yes some parts rise faster than others (and maybe some point are even cooler) but the oceans are absorbing energy at a massive rate. 4 Hirohima sized A-bombs every second. You seem to be denying the fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Perhaps it's just the way you wrote it but... No one is suggesting CO2 alone is the culprit for all climate change but climate changes for a reason. There are loads of attribution studies and studies on the various things that could contribute to global warming. There is strong evidence only CO2 can account for the warming of the past 50 years and way more than half of it for the last 100 or so years. Most natural influences seem to be in cooling phases yet ice continues to melt and the Earth continues to absorb increasing amount of energy.",UC9nPUN2iDgi58BiwFO8gMVA,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

And these missing charts and graphs? I still see many of things like this put up by the usual suspects but what it usually turns out to be is an partial data graph by Royer that shows CO2 and temps out of sync in Earth's long term past. However CO2 isn't the only factor and as soon as you put in the slowly increasing power of the sun back in you immediately get a very good connection between CO2 and temperature variation. Your claim that a) historically CO2 follows temps is only partly right and doesn't demonstrate what you think. In the last 400,000 years the ice age cycle has had that pattern but what happens there confirms the power of CO2. While Milankovitch cycles start the warming (and cooling) without the feedback provided by CO2 the temperature changes would not have been anywhere near as large. The lag was predicted by James Hanson before the ice core data was available. However there are other times where CO2 has led temperatures such as the snowball earth period and the Ordovician ice age. A couple years ago Richard Alley gave a talk at the AGU yearly conference. It was called ""The Biggest Control Knob:.CO2 in Earth's Climate History."" It is available on youtube and in it he explains how CO2 has been the dominant (but not only) force in climate change throughout earth's history. You pretty much can't explain anything without it. Otherwise your other claims are incorrect. While there are a few places where polar bears are increasing (global warming will initially help bears further north) Most of the bear populations are shrinking.

5684,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-2Fvv7-QWhfcNTLl,,2,2014-09-02 16:11:19,Cameron Taylor,"@Veritasium I appreciate your reply. I'll address a few of your rebuttals, and if you have time to respond to mine then great! I'm not sure that I agree with the idea that >95% of working climate scientists think that, and I'm wondering where you've read that? The meteorologists and climatologists I know are people I went to school with or met through geog-career centric networks. I attended a school that was very pro-conventional global warming theory, and the students I attended it with were taught the conventional theories as well - we have all come to be critical of the theories through our own research and contemplation, and are not part of any fringe groups which might suggest we've been conditioned to have these views. I should add that not all of these ""climate scientists"" share my exact views, but all feel that CO2 is being over-hyped as a cause of climate change. If you know 20 people (who you know personally and feel will give you an honest opinion) in the climate/meteorology field and 19 of them have told you they believe CO2 is responsible, then that's fine - but that's not my experience. I generally find that the majority of people in these fields who support the CO2-culprit theory are employed by organizations who have affiliations or direct interests in the carbon credit trade, or overpriced green energy technologies. An example of which would be a large wind farm which is being produced by Samsung in my local South Western Ontario. Wind is great, but these turbines cost far more than comparable European models, and are subsidized. Furthermore, the idea was promoted based on studies by ""climate scientists"" who were employed both by Samsung and the provincial government, and with conclusions which were unrealistically optimistic about the potential benefits. Suspicious circumstances in my opinion, and these are typically the types of studies which are cited as being the ""common opinion"" of ""climate scientists"". I don't disagree that the fossil fuel companies are paying people to say there's nothing wrong with pollution in the petroleum industry. It's definitely one of the most evil things going in this world, and I fully support your opposition to their agendas. I'm not so sure about the relative funding for non-petroleum funded scientists, because like I said above, most of the rah-rah CO2-culprit studies I see are funded by organizations who are pretty determined to get the theory out there, and I can't honestly say I feel they're any less biased than the oil companies. The funding may well not be on the same order of magnitude, but neither side ever seems to conduct studies addressing all possible variables. Milankovich cycles are responsible for temperature variation, and act as one of the few constants in atmospheric variation, but of course have no direct impact on CO2. It's true that CO2 has generally followed in sync with temperature changes, because various factors in the environment do connect CO2 with temperature, but it's a two way street. I'm not sure where the 90% of temperature rises follow CO2 rises could come from. I know there's a 400,000 year chart that is often referenced where it seems like that in some of the spikes, but there are parts of that chart where CO2 clearly leads temperature changes. More importantly, if I remember correctly the major contradiction with those charts was that there are many occasions where spikes occurred simultaneously, but then temperature dropped back down to normal levels while CO2 remained high - suggesting that CO2 alone wasn't the mechanism for high temperatures, and that spikes were likely the results of a common trigger, rather than primarily on any sort of isolated relationship between CO2 and temperature. As far as the volcanoes go, you're probably right about that. I don't have a lot of time to spare (on top of this essay, haha) but I did read through the link, as well as a few quick searches and I can't really refute that point. It was a few years ago when I read about that, and perhaps it WAS based on the idea that supervolcanic eruptions in the past have rapidly increased atmospheric CO2 levels without a corresponding rise in temperature, and not based on typical annual flows. Although now that I think about it a supervolcano would also block out a lot of energy from the sun, so that could explain a relative drop in temperature - I'm not sure, I'm gonna have to think about that one. Ocean acidification is a whole different problem in my opinion, and definitely needs to be addressed. I'm not so sure about the ocean warming part though - it's been a couple years, but the last study I read (that I felt was unbiased) found that temperature rises tended to be more regional than global, with a significant number of spots having cooled over the same time period. All the same, I'd say we have a lot more to worry about going into the ocean than CO2. In all honesty, it's been a couple years since I did any serious research into this subject, and since then my knowledge has been maintained through casual discussions and any studies I come across. It just often seems like anything I read on the topic is biased and heavily rhetorical (not including your video in particular, I should add). I'm certainly lean towards the idea that we should lessen CO2 emissions, because most bad pollutants accompany CO2, but I get frustrated by either side being so sure of their beliefs, and lambasting the other side as being paid-for. I'd really like the general public opinion to be 'We need to lower all levels of pollution, and we need to move towards clean, renewable energy. We need to make this transition in a reasonable manner, in a reasonable time frame (20 years, in the west?) in a manner which is equitable and fair for all parties involved. We should not make sweeping and sudden changes with drastic economic impacts based on studies where a clear consensus is not found.' And again, I guess it comes down to belief - but I feel like the professionals I personally know represent a reasonable sample of the climate-field's professional population, with no clear interest in promoting one side over the other - especially in private conversations with myself.",UCGHWdDhRFTbmeTWhNJmc3dg,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

The reason I mentioned the consensus is because most people don't know that >95% of working climate scientists think humans are causing the climate to warm. You may know some of the 5% that don't. If one doctor diagnoses you with cancer, it's not good. If 19 out of 20 do, it's really bad. They might be wrong, but I would go with them. Right now 7 of the 8 biggest companies in the world are fossil fuel companies, together pulling in over 2 trillion in annual revenue. Climate scientists receive about 10-15 billion per annum in the US and I think this figure wouldn't be much changed if their findings were different. Scientists are paid to study things, not to get particular outcomes. Fossil fuel companies sell only fossil fuels. The money, political power, and conflict of interest are not of the same order of magnitude. Regarding the science: a) CO2 has followed temperature rises. Milankovich cycles triggered warming, which resulted in outgassing of CO2 from the oceans. This led to further warming in a positive feedback loop. Over 90% of the temperature rise follows the initial increase in CO2. Where did you get your data about volcanoes leading to massive spikes in CO2 emissions? Annually they release less than 1% of human produced CO2. No eruption in the last century caused a significant change to the increase in CO2: http://static.skepticalscience.com/images/CO2_vs_Volcano.gif Even a super eruption would only release 1/8th the amount of CO2 we emit annually. If CO2 were not causing a problem I would be all for continuing to emit it. It's only a pollutant if it's causing ocean acidification and/or warming. So do you think there is evidence for these things or is CO2 not a problem in your opinion?",UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

To give some background on myself, I spent the first two years of university studying meteorology before switching to Urban Planning. I have a strong distrust and dislike for the motives and actions of petroleum companies, as well as other public-private entities that have a vested interest in carbon emitting technologies. That being said, I have to play devils advocate, as I often hear some of the arguments made in this video and find them to be frustrating and faulty. First of all, the only people I ever hear say ""most climate scientists agree"" are journalists, PR reps, or people citing either of the former. I know a good number of people who are professional meteorologists or climatologists and none of them feel this issue is anywhere near settled. Of course there are many parties involved who are willing to spend millions of dollars to see that CO2 is allowed to keep flowing freely, and I'm opposed to that. What's often lesser talked about is the amount of money that can be made by private corporations (equally as selfish and untrustworthy as the oil companies) off of many of the proposed ""solutions"" to carbon emissions. Many of the scientific studies done which promote CO2 as being a major contributor to climate change are quite misleading, using time periods which fit the theory, but excluding time periods which do not. I don't blame people for falling into this trap. I did a quick search on google for some of these charts, and it seems like everywhere you look it's the same biased charts. Five years ago it was a lot easier to find broader and less biased data. The two major points are that a) historically atmospheric CO2 increases have FOLLOWED temperature increases, and not the other way around, and b) there have been numerous occasions throughout history where natural phenomenon such as volcanic eruptions have led to massive spikes in CO2 - far larger than anything produced by humans - with little change in global temperatures over even the short-medium term. The Earth has an amazing capacity to correct itself, and as was alluded to in previous posts H2O has a lot to do with it. The relative radiative force of H2O vs CO2 is debatable, 450x seems high, but to say that measuring it's base W/m2 is an accurate proportional account of it's impact on warming would be a bit simplified, as most of the Earth's mechanisms for self-correction are based in variations in H2O, with many layers of compounded affection. You're correct that higher temperatures will mean higher concentrations of H2O, but there is a fairly short reset period for that type of offset. For the record, I'm all for sustainable, pollutant-free living. I don't have any interest in seeing oil companies maintain their empires. What I'm against is the gung-ho attitude that many intelligent people seem to have about ""global warming"" or ""climate change"", and the immediate dismissal of dissenters as having the interests of oil corps at heart - because (ironically) I believe that feeling so strongly about CO2 being the primary problem signifies that someone has been brainwashed by a different faction of corporate interests - interests who are certainly not interested in environmentalism or sustainability. The tactics used by these factions are just as flawed and reprehensible. Claims that the poor polar bears will loose their home for example, completely unfounded and the opposite is actually true - polar bear numbers are increasing in Northern Canada. Citing ""facts"" like the idea that CO2 might be responsible for up to a quarter of the earth's comprehensive warming, or that the ice caps are melting for the first time in recent history is just plain wrong - examples of ""facts"" which are only ""facts"" because everyone keeps saying it, not because it's true. I'm not saying climate change isn't occurring, and it IS something we should be concerned about. We should keep pushing for clean energy, and sustainability, but CO2 in my opinion is not the culprit.",UCGHWdDhRFTbmeTWhNJmc3dg,1,UgiAiWEaNBdkYHgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

If they don't ever have cooling towers how do you explain the following from the University of Kentucky web site? ""Because of the intense heat, the water vaporizes into superheated high-pressure steam. The steam passes through a turbine (which is similar to a large propeller) connected to a generator. The incoming steam causes the turbine to rotate at high speeds, creating a magnetic field inside wound wire coils in the generator. This pushes an electric current through the wire coils out of the power plant through transmission lines. After the steam passes through the turbine chamber, it is cooled down in cooling towers and it again becomes part of the water/steam cycle."" http://www.uky.edu/KGS/coal/uses_of_coal.htm (there's also a nice diagram of where cooling towers fit into a coal plant's design.

They have been warming rapidly. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Ocean_Heat_Content_(2012).png/400px-Ocean_Heat_Content_(2012).png 2) Even here surface temps have risen slowly according to all the surface temp records. Also, Cowtan and Way (2013) used an ingenious way to infill missing data and they halved the discrepancy. Apparently you don't know what an ice cap is as both Greenland and Antarctica (the ice caps) are melting at accelerating rates. (Hint: There is no Arctic Ice Cap) I think you mean sea ice. What about sea ice? Arctic Sea ice extent is at the lowest levels for at least 1450 years and has lost ~40% of it's extent in the last 40 years. (although there is year to year variation) Antarctic Sea Ice has grown despite warmer oceans and air. There is a lot of work happening to understand this and it is very interesting. It may well be, in part, due to AGW freshening the water and lowering it's freezing point. In any case there is no case to be made for a cooling planet.

That means 3 or 4 degrees Celcius by that time with more on the way because it takes a while for the planet to catch up. 2C would likely be a major problem 4C or higher would be a huge problem. 2100. 100 years.

In the Ordovician an ice age began when atmospheric CO2 levels dropped below 3000ppm, 7.5 times higher than today. It just seems that most of the points in your big picture are actually pretty well understood. The past proves CO2 is the key cause of climate change in all of Earth's history.

If you heat up the climate it disrupts the water cycle and habitats that support this agriculture. We do know what happens to agriculture when you heat up the Earth. At a certain point (2 C) the benefits endowed by extra CO2 (which mind you we've found reduces the nutritional content of crops) is overwhelmed by drought and crop output goes down dramatically. 25% by 2050. When the population is still growing. This is in the latest IPCC reports. Meanwhile a very well known phenomenon known as ocean acidification kills off coral reefs (which host 25% of aquatic species, some of which we need for food) and also kill off plankton and cause ecosystem collapses. Combine this with overfishing and we have a shortfall of 50% by 2050 of seafood.

If your theoretical cycle is effective we would not be experiencing the effects of global warming. Sadly to say the amount of carbon dioxide being produced are far beyond the ability for plants to naturally compensate. Also a vast array or plant specious are sensitive to temperature changes effectively killing them off. Any who the vast oceans that cover a large majority of our planet are the bigger players in carbon dioxide clean up or more precisely the coral and shellfish that use the carbon dioxide to build their frames. Once again sadly the oceans are too effective at soaking up carbon dioxide making the certain waters too acidic; this dissolves the marine life structure weakening or killing the poor mollusks and other sea life. As an individual with experience in marine life keeping, fractions of Celsius are life and death for the less hardy aquatic life. ALSO!!

You may already know this but I find this site: http://skepticalscience.com/ informative. But as I have found, it doesn't seem to matter how much information (even good/new information and rigorous work on root cause analysis) you bring up in discussion about this subject, it seems to regress quite a lot of the time into a battle of opinions and misinformation. Not that this is not an excuse to stop talking about it though.. The observation of how we humans can't process gradual threats really rings true. Gradual changes to the predictability of weather and the consequence to our ability to consistently grow food, have access to good quality freshwater just doesn't seem to cut it. It makes me wonder if our collective response would be better if the effects were dramatic like this recent movie 'Into the Storm""!  'Global warming' was such an unfortunate term. Although it is correct as it describes the change in a global temperature as an index. Too often it gets applied at a local level. The changes increasingly being seen in climate modelling is that at a local level predictability is becoming less certain. ie: it could get hotter, colder, drier or wetter and at an intensity/mildness that is unusual for that time and at that location. Very boring indeed. If there is any chance, it may be in telling people that they can make a difference and although we are all different, at some level we all want the same things? (Yes this is not very 'scientific'. heh) Every little bit that everyone does to reduce their emissions helps. Choosing or growing local produce, eat a little less meat, ride a bike, walk to someplace close by instead of driving. It's seems kinda silly but there's a lot of us.. Initially inconvenient, it could be quite cheap in some ways, but maybe a healthy and fulfilling life? Maybe with this kind of living, some of us will realise how poorly our political representatives are at looking after our long term national and personal interests and well being? I think we all have this common ground, we want to be happy, be safe, be valued, contribute, not be hungry, have access to fresh water. (got this reminder from a David Suzuki talk). Sure we're all different, more often than not, we get told about our differences, but we forget that we probably have a hell of a lot more things in common! The earth will continue, with our without us, so we might as well have a go at working on this, we ARE doing it for ourselves. Yikes.. I went on a bit.

In your video everyone you ask is over ~25 years (like myself) and we were educated back then about the ozone layer hole (due to pollution) and how it wouldn't protect us against the sun and we would 'bake'. Also, pollution was all over our textbooks back then and the solution proposed was recycling. So yeah, there is this whole generation over 25 years now that thinks global warming is related to the ozone layer hole and we are all proud of our recycling. I can easily see how/why people in this age group mistake these issues. We also learned how the ocean currents were being affected and it would mess with the weather but that faded quickly when we didn't saw ice ages and severe droughts everywhere (i'm not saying it is/isn't happening). Does anyone remember that? I do believe (and hope so!) today's children are taught about the global warming and can define it pretty well. So maybe asking the question to a younger pool would yield surprising results. Science evolves, prepetually corrects itself and gets ever so closer to being right thanks to the scientific method. Here is some fun idea *+Veritasium*, get the first science textbook (grade might depend on location) from 25-30 years ago and then compare it to the next year up until the present.

Well, it&#39;s not that simple, that&#39;s the 2nd biggest hurdle (apart from educating the masses that climate change is real, and we as humans are the primary cause). Some solutions (but definitely not all)<br /><br />- Biofuel: Takes so much space to grow crops and doesn&#39;t output much energy in comparison to the need of energy, plus it takes away from space for growing food (even as we still have people starving) and also it doesn&#39;t reduce carbon emissions, only produces about equal to what they take in while growing.<br /><br />- Nuclear fission: Very good output, takes ages to dispose of waste, thousands of years burying waste is not a very good idea. It has dangers of meltdown as has been shown and also is a target for those who wish to misuse them.<br /><br />- Most &#39;renewable&#39; measures, like solar, wind, tide, geothermal etc: Don&#39;t provide much energy at all, to provide more it would need a lot of room, lot of cost, and to be honest sounds worse than sticking to coal, gas and oil. Many have limitations of availability of energy like hydroelectric, others need specific climates or sun availability, the list of downsides is almost endless.<br /><br />Nuclear fusion: In my opinion is the best bet, the way forward and where i think i large amount of money needs to be invested, the ITER looks promising but is still in research phase and extremely expensive and hasn&#39;t of yet been able to provide more energy than it uses. The project at the NIF is also promising but isn&#39;t there yet and needs more research, needs more money and has a lot of cost. Doesn&#39;t produce much waste, produces helium and it uses sea water and makes so much energy. (Not accurate figures but if i recall from a documentary 1 gallon of water would make enough energy as 100,000 gallons of oil).<br /><br />But the best would be a combination with my personal opinion of focussing primarily on fusion. But clearly this is debated and I hope my point has been made, the solution is far from clear. All I have said doesn&#39;t take into account of poorer nations, how would they cope with their current problems as well as trying to change to this new cleaner energy etc.<br /><br />Oh, one other addition I wanted to mention, one other solution is &quot;reducing energy consumption&quot;, I agree little reduction to stop &#39;waste&#39; but overall the effect of stopping the waste of energy would be little. Crashcourse uploaded a video about energy and mentioned &quot;vast reductions of our energy usage would be a step back into the past&quot; which I agree with on the most part. Stopping waste like leaving lights on downstairs while you&#39;re asleep, but overall we need ever-growing amounts of energy for everything, reducing overall is not an option. Even less sustainable than sticking to coal, gas and oil.<br /><br />The solution is far from clear. But the debate is needed and education is paramount.

Wealthy people, on the other hand, part with far less of a percentage (if they even bother at all) and it's not even close to enough for them to actually feel the loss. If I were to give a homeless person $100, I would feel it. I might not be able to pay my bills or buy enough food for the month. The homeless person might be able to buy a few hot meals and go to the laundrymat to wash their clothes, maybe get something little to make them smile for a bit. It would certainly help them feel better, but it wouldn't really improve their situation directly. If a millionaire gave that same homeless person $10,000, the millionaire would barely notice--hell, he probably has suits that cost more than that--and yet the homeless person would have been given a direct and powerful second chance at life. Yet millionaires never do this. It's completely unheard-of.

You can't really expect every average Steve to go do research, trying to verify every source.  For example, I've met with an opinion that our emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere are actually really minuscule, compared to the volume of the atmosphere. Now, to properly confirm the point, I would have to check the amount of emissions (provided they are factual), the volume of an atmosphere, learn the way CO2 dissipates into air and how that correlates to the actual heat absorption, and only then I can say for sure that things look this way or another.

I am going to say that a sky is red. What do you do? You look out the window and say ""Yeah, it's bullshit, the sky is blue"". So what If I said that I did an extensive research and found that there are actually tiny people living on atoms, which developed a far more advanced technology than ours? You wouldn't believe me? Why, because I am a random person on the internet? What if I named myself a professor of physics? Then added tens of photoshopped images to an article and presented a long list of other professors and doctors who I say also worked on this project? What if then I had my ten friends say the exact same thing in other sources, while also saying they are serious scientists? Watch Veritasium's first videos again, most people don't know how basic physics work, they are not going to study hundreds of science projects (or whatever you call it in English, the paper you write at an university to prove a theory) just to check if that guy who named himself a serious scientist in TV said truth about tiny people on atoms. Since he is being presented as an expert, he must speak truth, right? But then comes out another guy, also claiming to be an expert, and says ""What this guy says is bullshit."" So then begins a discussion on whether or not the guy who spoke about tiny people on atoms is right or not. Of course he is being defrauded as being a liar. But then one or two corporations start to think ""Hey, if those people believe in those tiny guys on atoms, we can make some money on that..."", so they make a public campaign with people posing as scientists saying that there are, in fact, tiny people on atoms. Of course the actual scientists know better, but to a common citizen you know what this looks like? Two guys bickering about whether the sky is blue or red. Only the common citizen has no way of looking out the window and checking it without spending half his life making a degree. It's not people that are to blame, it's the media and corporate whores who will do anything to get money out of people. Most of today's science is based on a benefit of a doubt, so when you have two sides saying something totally opposite while at the same time trying to convince everyone that THEY are the believable source, people are simply going to believe the side they find more comfortable/natural. And that often depends on political/social views. And before anyone says this: No, statistics can be falsified.

These are factual readings that anyone can find with a quick Google. Taking these into account and the fact (as stated in this video) that carbon absorbs more infrared radiation than oxygen and stays in the atmosphere for extended periods. More info on that here: http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/2012/03/06/carbon-dioxide-how-can-one-little-molecule-be-such-a-big-troublemaker/ That's some compelling evidence that carbon is a problem. You said ""people can twist data to say something different"". So can you twist this data to say that carbon emissions aren't causing climate change? Can you show me proof contrary to the proof that I have just shown you? You said ""co2 science is all just a theory and there are some pretty serious flaws"". Are you a physicist? The man who made this video is. Einstein's theory of relativity is just a theory too but it seems to work. What are the flaws? Can you please give a more concrete cause of global warming? The fact is if almost every plumber I could speak to told me that my toilet is broken, that it needs to be fixed and that I broke it by attempting to kick it to flush it. But I told them that it in fact is not broken, kicking a toilet is the best way to flush it and I know more than them about toilets. Then I would be a moron, because I am not a plumber or anything that better qualifies me to diagnose a broken toilet. So the question is what is you qualification that allows you to question the findings of many scientists? Research by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has identified CO2 as “The Thermostat That Controls Earth’s Temperature.” A science brief by NASA scientist Andrew Lacis emphasizes that, while both water and CO2 are greenhouse gases, they provide different functions in the maintenance of the greenhouse effect. Water vapor condenses, whereas CO2, methane, ozone, and the other trace gases are non-condensing. Lacis writes: Water vapor accounts for about 50% of the Earth’s greenhouse effect, with clouds contributing 25%, carbon dioxide 20%, and the minor greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols accounting for the remaining 5%… Thus, while the non-condensing greenhouse gases account for only 25% of the total greenhouse effect, it is these non-condensing GHGs that actually control the strength of the terrestrial greenhouse effect since the water vapor and cloud feedback contributions are not self-sustaining and as such, only provide amplification. Because carbon dioxide accounts for 80% of the non-condensing GHG forcing in the current climate atmosphere, atmospheric carbon dioxide therefore qualifies as the principal control knob that governs the temperature of Earth. Do you have greater qualifications than a NASA scientist? If you are greater qualified, can you please post a link to any papers you have written on the matter?",UCv_eQK_H5imeuK372LpYK4g,1,UghLC2aS8b406XgCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

However, to get to those concepts, you must learn vocabulary and grammar and you must practice (through extensive reading, listening to comprehensible speech, etc.) not to mention, a lot of those concepts are revealed as you're learning vocabulary (one of the first things one should learn when studying a language is that direct translations often don't exist outside of nouns and basic verbs). As for Spanish and English being similar, I'd say that's only because of the culture and extreme French (and classical) influences in today's Modern English. Even Middle English is nearly unrecognizable to native English speakers (especially in text...), and Old English is a Germanic language that must be studied almost from the ground up. All three are rightly considered different languages (and that doesn't even get into dialects).

It doesn't take much of a foray into learning theory or comparisons between different learning techniques to see that they are structured the same as most other classes in mandatory schooling levels: catering to the lowest common denominator in order to pad test averages and ensure that the average student becomes the average worker with average knowledge. This is not a conspiracy theory, it's the inevitable conclusion to mass-produced education; but even for these standards, foreign language is handled poorly (else so many people wouldn't fail it). EDIT: Oh, and might I mention that content from an introductory psych course will give you enough to know that school isn't optimized for learning, but to pump out identical drones. As for math and other subjects; I was quite satisfied with the progress once I made it out of highschool; what would've taken two years or so in highschool took only a semester at my college. I don't know what country you're from, but here, math is taught poorly as well (though now they expect most students to have studied basic trigonometry before college; doesn't mean they expect you to know it though). However, most people can fly through math class in primary and secondary schooling, so the pace serves it's purpose. To touch on the problem of schools padding test averages; I know for a fact that this is a thing, because the principal of my elementary school (public school, good standing) flat out told my parents that my performance was the only reason they didn't expel me for my behavior (I'm bipolar and was unable to control myself well as a child). They kept a problem child *because I made them look good*. That's the main thing the school administration cares about; the teachers and staff are the only ones who might give a damn about the students actual knowledge (I had several teachers that went out of their way to teach us something extra that would actually be useful as opposed to just following the base curriculum).",UC1zpoo4_GBFB5sHdnXPzGKg,1,UggitEEAUAfiN3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

I'm a native Spanish speaker, and after learning a decent amount of English, when I think inside my mind I do it with both Spanish and English concepts. Sometimes I can express them in using just Spanish words, but other times I really don't know how to do it, because some English concepts are not in the Spanish language (and vice versa). But really, at the end of the day, English and Spanish have a lot in common.

Unless he was at an excellent school that went above and beyond standard curriculum for Japanese language courses, he probably could have achieved the same amount in only half a year or so of dedicated study; languages classes are generally poorly paced, due to the massive amount of content one needs to digest, regular students (ones without real interest in the language) just wouldn't be able to keep up. I will say, though, that having an actual class gives far better opportunity to practice actual speaking than self-study (though there are many ways around this problem for learners that can talk to practice partners or tutors over the internet). I've been studying Japanese for four or five years now; most of my focus is on literacy and I have achieved a level at which I can understand most structures and can read various written works intended for various audiences with an expected curve in difficulty as the content strays from my vocabulary. However, this has been at the almost complete neglect of aural comprehension as well as spoken (I only learned proper pronunciation) and written production; I can only form basic sentences, and that takes far longer than it needs to, because I haven't practiced; instead, I worked on something I wanted above all else: to be able to read. The thing about language classes is, the vocabulary necessary to consistently understand the majority of words in any medium, genre, or topic is far too large to cram into someone in such a slow paced course, especially since they expect you to use the worst memorization technique: rote memorization. Grammar is a beast that is easier or harder depending on what language(s) you know, what language you're learning, and how much experience you have learning grammar, so I won't even get into that topic. I know I've been particularly indirect, so I'll just clarify to any who've read this far: language classes do nothing for anyone who doesn't care to learn on their own as well. If you don't study on your own and explore the language outside of the classroom, you will not learn it; you might remember a few phrases that might save you from peeing yourself (「トイレはどこですか」) and such, but that's about it. Thus, I think mandatory foreign language classes are stupid (maybe with the exception of English). I'm all for language classes being available though, I sure wish I had the chance to take a Japanese class at school (I might be able to speak a bit more); unfortunately, even in college, very few schools in my area offer it (they teach German, but not Japanese... this is the US! Unless I'm getting a music degree, I can't see any need for them to prefer German to Japanese!) and it's just not in my budget to pay for classes that don't count towards my degree.",UC1zpoo4_GBFB5sHdnXPzGKg,1,UggitEEAUAfiN3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26

Altranis does have the correct view because they do help you with many different things. I have personally taken French for three years and I have retained what I've learned. I've actually been able to help different people just by speaking the Language. I learned Spanish when I was small and I am still, even though I haven't used it for 4 years, very fluent in it. I can speak it when I go to Mexico and I have no problem communicating with other people. The idea that ""learning languages is useless because students forget what they learned"" is idiotic. If someone forgets the language, as Altrantis said, it's becuase they never knew it or never really tried. If you don't like to learn a new language that's fine, but trying to institute that all language classes are useless and ALL do a horrible job of teachign is a horrid generalization. Now for the idea that a ""universal translator"" will come about so there's no reason to learn a language also has its drawbacks. First, translators never translate actual language. What I mean by this is that the specific meaning of certain words is not relayed. Anyone who speaks 2 different languages often encounter this problem. THere are sometimes words or ideas that exist in one language but not another. Moreover, a universal translator will never give you the same understanding of an idea or culture that learning a language will. Yes, it will let you communicate but it will not make you understand an area's culture and their traditions. If you don't care about that, that's fine but then why would you be travelling anyways? It's fine to learn whatever you'd like but languages are still an important part of our humanity. Just because one has reigned supreme (English) because of global conflicts does not mean the rest are useless or do not contribute to society. Learning a computer programming language is useful in its own aspects but it gives you a different set of skills than learning a language. Programing a computer or robot is amazing (I would know, I have learned programming languages) but also is being able to speak and understand a large amount of people, just by studying a ""useless"" language.",UCSO_2c0NuOq-pV7AoNUXyOw,1,UggitEEAUAfiN3gCoAEC,eNx9tvCrvv8,2014-08-29 22:47:26
