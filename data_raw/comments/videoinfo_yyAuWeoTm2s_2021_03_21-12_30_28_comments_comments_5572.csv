Wow, I didn't realize any of that. Thanks for clearing this up for me. You obviously missed the joke associated with my pretty accurate assumption of what may be going on with all of these fear mongering global warming headlines that we see daily. No, there is no possible chance that humans have zilch to do with the climate, that the planet's climate is on a fast track to destruction due to our behavior. These are all just hypothesis, which are not proven to date. The only thing that is proven, based on our global pollution, is that we can seriously eff up an ecosystem, and it's entirety of all life that lives within said ecosystem. other than that, the rest is merely speculation driven so hard down our throats, you would think that humans in general are the deadliest poison on this planet. My original comment was a mildly laughable comparison to how our daily weather forecasting is. We literally have dozens of weather models that will all tell a complete different story for the same place and time. Therefore making my comment true, for weather. If meteorologists have a hard time predicting the weather a few days out, then i sure as heck think the predictions of climate, years out, is laughable at best.

What caused the warming and those past ice ages? Answer: Earth life cycles. It&#39;s that simple. Life is all about opposites. There&#39;s construction and destruction. Earth is in her destruction phase so all we can do is weather the storm the best we can imo. Here is some food for thought.

The latitude if London in eastern Canada would be considered northern. Also many computer models were accurate. Hansen et al., 1981 Predicted a rise if 0.65C from 1981 to 2017 (latest year with data presented on website). In reality 2017 was about 0.75C warmer than ~1980. 1988 Hansen et al. Predicted a rise of temps of 0.9C by 2017. Reality was 0.75C. This is because he predicted an increased use of halocarbons, which were mostly banned by the Montreal Protocol. This is why the prediction was higher. The prediction of CO2 concentrations was very similar to what was observed. IPCC 1990 first assessment Predicted a mean of 0.84C rise, when in reality is was 0.75. However this was within the margin of error. IPCC 1995 2and assessment Predicted a rise if 0.55C. In reality it was 0.75. This is means the projection actually underestimated global warming. IPCC 2001 third assessment Projected a 0.62C rise, which again underestimated the warming observed. As you can see, many projections that accounted for a rise in CO2 concentrations found that we were to expect warming, which is what we observed. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming",UCtwg-6pkEm62TNXBWpWJ2yw,1,UgzIIXfwRUNK5iGb0iN4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Humans are as responsible for gloval warming as ants and spiders are responsible for warming your basement. <br />One Volcanic eruption teleases more &quot;greenhouse&quot; gasses than man has in the last 5,000 years.<br />Gloval warming and cooling are a natural event/cycle. Human activity has less than zero effect on the cycle.<br />In answer to your question &quot;can global warming lead to a new iceage?&quot; The answer is &quot;yes&quot;.<br />The evidence so far indicates there was a period of global warming just prior to every iceage. Considering the fact tbat humans and industrialization were not around prior to any of the ice ages (there has been more than one) kinda shoots holes in the &quot;humans are responsible&quot; bull shit.<br />Prior to the 1700&#39;s and long before &quot;the industrial revolution&quot;, people were ice scating on the Thames River until it stopped freezing over in the late 1700&#39;s/early 1800&#39;s, again, long before the industrial revolution.<br />Global Warming is &quot;old news&quot;, its been happeninh for hundreds of years.<br />When (not &quot;if&quot;) the Gulf Stream stops or slows enough, there will be another iceage, which will last until the Gulf Stream starts flowing again. Just like every iceage before.<br />Shore lines will receed, not raise. Who knows? Maybe Florida and Cuba will be connected by dry land again, and the Mediterranean Sea will once again be cut off from the Atlantic, and evaporate to the point it no longer exists again. Sea Levels will drop enough the English Channel will be dry, connecting Britian to France.<br />Alaska and Russia will again have a &quot;land bridge&quot; connecting them. üò∑ <br />Will the shorelines be tbe same after the next iceage? Who inows? I don&#39;t. I kinda doubt they will be. The San Andreas Fault may finally have &quot;The Big One&quot; during tbe iceage, and California might be an island or sea bottom as far inland as Nevada and Utah, to the east, and Oregon to the north, when the new iceage is over.

Science is the process of observation, and then making predictions and then seeing is those predictions come to pass. If they don't then your theory is flawed. EVERY climate model that has been used for predictions so far has been wildly inaccurate. In real science when your predictions of what your theory should have happen don't happen, then your theory is seen as wrong and garbage. Any fool that actually thinks C02 is a pollutant and that 400 part per million of C02 is a bad thing, then they have no understanding of the historical past of C02 in the atmosphere. at 400 parts per million we are still at a very low level compared to the earths past. The carbon in coal and oil, did not start in the coal and the oil. It was once in the atmosphere. It got in the coal and oil by plants using photosynthesis and extracting C02 out of the atmosphere.

Kurt Dobson,"For thinking people; ah, the great debate on climate change. <br /><br />One way to test whether this is an honest exchange of facts and ideas is to to seed these sites with facts and ideas that either support the narrative, or contest it. I have done this over the last week on at least forty of the major taking one side or the other. <br /><br />What I found is that usually within 48 hours, anything I say that doesn&#39;t support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is supportive, while anything post that would support the argument stays. Makes one wonder where the money is coming from...<br /><br />From NASA:¬† Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the¬†ice age¬†would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional ‚Äúblips‚Äù every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth&#39;s orbit‚Äîeccentricity, obliquity, and¬†‚Äîaffect global climate. But it&#39;s a lot more complicated than that. <br /><br />And, the last ice age was about 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn&#39;t do so well because it&#39;s hard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis. Whales, insects and such do much better and have been doing so for 100&#39;s of millions of years.<br /><br />So, I totally believe in climate change... It&#39;s been going on for 100&#39;s of millions of years, since planet formation.¬† Long before humans arrived; and yep, the ice caps melt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive.<br /><br /><br /><br />And, finally any huge heroic effort by humanity to change things one way or another would take another 100k years (one cycle) to measure the effect. <br /><br />I&#39;ll wait a few days and see which if any of my comments survive whoever has time and access to edit or eliminate my input.<br /><br />It&#39;s pretty easy to get the impression that the narrative is being used as a political tool to try and get vast groups of people behind yet another &#39;crisis&#39;, then steer them to support a politician who puts himself up as a though-leader on the subject. The game is to capture votes.",UChiv0vaRdmkIXijxkj47TKQ,0,UgxyJBPSCSrR6BFLU-d4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Ice cores prove that the earth was 2 degrees celsius warmer than is is today. In 1975-1979 the news all was worried about global cooling. Look it up. Humans are nothing but a fart in the wind. There are also weather temperatures graphs where you can do your own analysis. Run a 30 year temperature change for your zip code or area code and you can see the ups and downs. Screen shot that, then go back another 30 years, screen shot and repeat. Overlay those and you will see the ups and downs of weather over time. In addition, if Climate change were real, why don‚Äôt insurance companies require Miami building developments to have climate change insurance packages for water level rises? Because climate change is a lie! Talk to the scientists at the south pole about ice cores. Bullshit narrative. The truth as much as science has advanced we still don‚Äôt know everything about how the earth works. Climate change is a bullshit narrative and a lie.

How far can you go down before it's pitch black in the ocean ? The upper layer of the ocean is from the surface to 700m down. And yup 70% of the sun's heat is there. But 30% of that heat is from 700m down to the very bottom. And it can take 35 years or more for that heat/energy to come to the surface. It also takes a drop of water about 1100 years to complete a circuit of it's current...... so there's a lot more to it. The caps melting will cause a drop in the surface temperature. One long winter, and we are most definitely in a solar minimum so it will happen, and the whole arctic circle will freeze. And pardon the pun, but the snowball effect would be rapid and long lasting. Also in a solar minimum the cosmic rays bombard us. These are very different to solar rays... oh and we do have a magnetosphere that's in a freefall we've never seen before. Well not for the last 12,500 years. Cosmic rays mean more rain. They bind particles, solar rays smash them apart. More melting snow caps, less reflection. More moisture in the air. And then there's the solar effect on volcanoes. One of the best coolaides this planet has.... It doesn't look good. Read up on Major White, Hapgood and co. I love smashing conspiracy theories.

With higher CO2 in the atmosphere, the ocean becomes more acidic, and with higher temperatures less oxygen rich. More CO2 can be held in water than is needed to become toxic to living things, let alone too acidic for exoskeletons of zooplankton to be built, so we don‚Äôt need to bother with CO2‚Äôs saturation since everything would be long asphyxiated before then. I should also say that the surface is where the depths get all their oxygen from. The depths will be slowly but surely asphyxiated. Nutrient flow would also be impacted. Without the waterfall system, the deep sea weakens in its ability to support life due to low trace minerals. This mixing helps drive oceanic life beyond thermal vents at the sea floor. The twilight zone becomes much more isolated from the surface zone since the warm surface water mixes less with the cooler deep water, with species that require journeying between the depths and surface for food by night getting whittled down in numbers due to less food, temperature shock, anoxia, and acidification. Eventually, marine snow volumes decrease, making the midnight and abyssal depth detrivores (those who eat dead animal and plant matter) eventually begin to starve too, causing their predators to also starve. Without the stable surface, the oceans cease to be the bustling place of life we know them to be. The poles‚Äô cooling and subsequent cooling over northern Europe doesn‚Äôt do enough to fully stop the greenhouse effect either. If anything, the effects wouldn‚Äôt have time to take hold as the climate keeps warming in a feedback loop from already existent ice loss. At most, the ice we have might be holding on for dear life for an additional few years before greenhouse gases caught up again. It couldn‚Äôt do much for long enough or fast enough to not still see widespread damage from warmer winters, since it takes centuries or millennia to grow enough permanent ice to combat our current level of warming. Despite the ice holding on for just a little longer, we still have a much hotter equator anyway, levelling out the would be ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù of the cooler north even further. The temperate subtropics might have a lovely stable climate for a short while, less perturbed by seasonal variances (which many species rely on), but would see worse offshoots of freak weather from all that ocean evaporation in the tropics and drier cool air in the north and south. The evaporation wouldn‚Äôt do enough for cloud coverage, either. Clouds only last so long, only do so much for our albedo, and storms tend to wreck natural sources of greenhouse gas absorption anyway. The one positive thing from all the clouds would be the subsequent storms‚Äô lightning making a tiny amount of extra ozone, as we‚Äôd really want it with all the heating going on.",UCgSwtc_1p316Y2QbHb1SWow,1,UgzOykBTQwqQ6A0lwax4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

CO2 back-radiation does not have the correct wavelength to penetrate the ocean deeper than its skin and therefore cannot heat the ocean. So we would need less clouds or a stronger Sun or less UV absorption in the atmosphere. Even so if the poles get colder because of a circulation breakdown we immediately would see more ice created so saltier denser water and less melt water the exact conditions for restoring the system. Also around the equator warmer seas would have more evaporation and therefore more cloud cover cooling the ocean.,UCFBmtPI1JWh92rixV3EJ2hg,1,UgzOykBTQwqQ6A0lwax4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

With more warmth, animals got huge-lots of nutrients being produced, so more life, and everything was bigger!!The planet is cooling my friends. Before 40 Million years ago, there were no ice caps, none. The planet is cooling and because this is happening, there is less CO2 as most of it is trapped as Calcium carbonate in our planets ground.

From my educational knowledge and research I have done, I can tell you three reasons why the Sahara was expanding: reason one: we are in a cold period, and when the climate is colder, the weather is dryer, deserts üèúexpand. Second reason: do you know about continental drift? Well the Sahara region of Africa is moving Northward, which means that where the Sahara used to be more south, at the equator where the climate is wetter because of the zenith of the sun (I learned this in my climatology classes when completing my degree), it rains along the equator as air rises the most there and loses its humidity, but when is comes back down to earth north and south of the equator, the air is already bone dry and so regions just North and South of the equator are arid, where lies the Sahara desert today, as all the deserts are located in the tropic regions of the earth. Finally the third reason for the Sahara expanding are all the grazing from üêê GOATS, mostly North is the Sahara. GOATS shave all of the vegetation, all of it!!!! This causes desertification! All these statements are back up by research, findings, data, stats and facts. If you don‚Äôt believe it, research it- you will be surprised. The Sahara was a equatorial Forrest at some point when located at the equator, but now located North of the equator, it turned into a desert.

Plants are more abundant and everything is growing minimum 20% faster and bigger! So where is the problem? More CO2 means the stomates of the plant leaves are not opened as wide because there is more CO2 in the atmosphere, smaller stomates means less water loss, so now plants are growing in dryer area, where plants could not grow before the area being too arid. Now because of more CO2, just 230 ppm more (200+230ppm), plants are thriving. You should watch the clips I provided earlier, and do your research. All talk is worth shit.

Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped<br /><br />From global warming or climate change there is going to be mass extinctions of humans and wildlife, we do not know when, but from pollution also we are going to face mass extinction.<br />We manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. So if we minimise our products, pollution would be less.<br />We produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things which are not required as a necessity for humans, so much pollution could be reduced.<br />What about the companies that are going to be shut down. They would have debts to pay, just excuse them.<br />If we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don&#39;t colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. <br /><br />2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form<br /><br />We can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. <br />But if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.<br />So if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, noodles, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world. Humans have to do this before it is too late.<br /><br />If this is done, then many jobs would be lost. For that many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own.<br />Is their any another solution, that humans won&#39;t lose jobs and also planet earth will be saved.<br />Industrial jobs or planet earth, which should we save, planet earth is more important. Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the earth, making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans after 100 or 200 years.",UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg,0,Ugxiaf2UScebDn4amSd4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Hey, I like many would like to be able to break it all down as we can find a massive amount of videos with that being the objective content. As much as I watch with great interest in the search for truth among many, many others who do the same, although no expert here is some analyzing of my own I have come up with in my quest for truth! To be quite honest, I&#39;m not sold on all this climate change / global green stuff, or at least as it has been promoted or presented. Unfortunately, too much diversive rationale has been mixed into the equation! Either way the &quot;catastrophic consequences&quot; that we should be even more concerned about is the massive change in &quot;global governmental structures&quot; that such persuasive assumptions has forcefully imposed upon our world, drastically erasing the true meaning of Independence and freedom that is intended to be known. Such propaganda has been so widely accepted now that people have naively become condition to believe anything that sounds supposedly factual, accepting information mixed with diversive assumptions (deception) on the basis of fear. Thus, separating the truth from lies has now become next to impossible for many, many people. As such deceptive conditioning has now been so widely accepted, the world is now prepared to be ushered into the final stages (as sheep that have been led to the slaughter) of this anti-Christ, &quot;New World Order&quot; entrapment which will ensure it&#39;s victims of no way to escape. By the way, have folks not considered the likelihood of the so called &quot;climate change&quot; actually being one of the many facets of God&#39;s wrath in the present tense (Rom <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyAuWeoTm2s&amp;t=1m18s"">1:18</a>; Eph 5:6)? Scripture makes it clear that God&#39;s wrath is not exclusively reserved for end times eschatology events! John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyAuWeoTm2s&amp;t=3m36s"">3:36</a> tells us that : &quot;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God&#39;s wrath &quot;REMAINS&quot; on them. As it is not God&#39;s will for any to perish (2 Pet 3:9), He will do things accordingly to &quot;frustrate the ways of the wicked&quot; (Ps 146:9) that whosoever will might come to repentance by accepting redemption (1 Pet <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyAuWeoTm2s&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a>) and avoid the fate of all &quot;Christ rejectors!&quot; SEE Matt <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyAuWeoTm2s&amp;t=25m46s"">25:46</a>. If you are one of the few who can tolerate literal truth as opposed to propaganda, watch these two presentations as your future will depend upon it! &gt;&gt;&gt; ttps://<a href=""http://youtu.be/lI3sXC9jhCY"">youtu.be/lI3sXC9jhCY</a> and, <a href=""https://youtu.be/sluNuVp2_TE"">https://youtu.be/sluNuVp2_TE</a>.

The transport and distribution of CO2 throughout the atmosphere is controlled by the jet stream, large weather systems, and other large-scale atmospheric circulations. In fact, carbon dioxide, which is blamed for climate warming, has only a volume share of 0.04 percent in the atmosphere. And of this 0.04 percent CO2, 95 percent comes from natural sources, such as SOILS, volcanoes, or decomposition processes in nature. The human CO2 content in the air is thus only 0.0016 percent.

You focus on rare spots like death valley or the atacama desert, while we discuss global effects. So as a simple start, do you have any OWN evidence that warming has increased? Did the evaporation increase globally? You may note that you will have to find statistical records that have not yet been altered by climate activists. Did the precipitation increase worldwide?

You need something more, like e.g. knowledge about the climate phases through the last holocene. This helps to check statements made in these publications, on correctness. Also detected contradictions tell you that something is wrong. Your GISS curve has a number of weaknesses. First, it starts with end of the little ice age (LIA), as do many sources that want to misslead. Of course, after the LIA, all temperatures are warmer, but do you know how warm it was before the LIA? Probably not! Then it shows no absolute temperatures - only anomalies. The second problem is the 1930s. The GISS curve is flat here, but this is a period, where newspapers already existed. An these newspapers from USA, to Europe and to Australia tell you that it was the hottest phase in the 20th century. Strange, GISS has flattened that. Why? Then we had a warming pause after the year 2000. Many independent institutions confirmed that. There were even articles on ""the pause"", asking, did the warming stop or is this just a temporary phenomenon. You GISS curve is in stark contradiction to previous publications, even by the IPCC.

Earths has been warming since the seventies and will keep on warming. And a song means nothing about climate. Also yes it‚Äôs been a chilly May, that‚Äôs because of the jet stream. As the arctic warms the jet stream slows down and becomes wavy. This cause extreme weather patterns. Like the extreme heat we saw out west this weekend and snow we see this weekend in the Northeast. Also weathers not climate and many northeastern cities are still on track for top 5 hottest years on record. Also idk what you mean by ‚Äúdry summers‚Äù because here in the United States, we have been seeing record wet years. Lots of flooding and rain. And the oceans are warming too.

Is it warmer now than 120 years ago? - and Are we causing it? The first answer is yes and is easy to prove. But if you ask the same question with a different point in time, the answer will be different. Is it warmer than 90 years ago? Definitely no and it is just as easy to prove. In the 1930s there were heat waves in the northern hemisphere that were much more severe than today. Your second question, are we causing it - requires that we agree on the first question. If you compare 1970-1980 to 1950-1960 then it is verifyably false. There is a famous song by Rudi Carell in which he laments that the summers of the 70s are so cold. And he braggs about the summers of his childhood in the 50s which were warm and sunny all through the summer. Please check this yourself if you are a critical thinker. I hope you understand that a question like the one you posed is not as easy to answer. Also please check, if you can, that the warming from 1990-2000 is over now. Right now we are in a proces of steady cooling. The freezing temperatures in May are an indication but not a solid proof for that. But the cooling of the atlantic ocean is a verifyable process. You can observe this yourself if you accept that the reduced rain and the drying of the country in europe is due to less ocean water evaporation. I guess you will immediately agree that the last 3 summers are dryer than before but you draw the false conclusion. A warm ocean evaporates more water and brings more rain - not a cold ocean!

Remember, when CO2 is high during an interglacial the world cools, and when CO2 is low at the glacial maximum, the world warms. Yes - counterintuitive, isn‚Äôt it... <br /><br /><br /><br />So what controls and modulates the interglacial cycle? Answer - orbital cycles and ice sheet albedo. <br /><br />Milankovitch orbital cycles provide the basis, but the surface feedback mechanism is albedo, not CO2. The albedo effect as measured in the high NH latitudes is orders of magnitude greater that any CO2 effects. Ice ages would continue indefinitely, if the high albedo of the ice-sheets could not be lowered. <br /><br /><br /><br />So what lowers ice sheet albedo? Answer - dust. <br /><br /> It is a fact that sudden dust-storms lasting for millennia, lower the ice sheet albedo just before every interglacial. Why these dust-storms suddenly happen, is fully explained in the science paper: Ice Age Modulation by Dust and Albedo. This dust production process is caused by CO2, but not in the manner you might imagine. <br /><br /><br /><br />See these Ice age modulation videos, based upon the science paper: <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99EHhiKG1ZI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99EHhiKG1ZI</a> <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fm2KMMrtXI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fm2KMMrtXI</a> R",UCsb-d7jyLoD7E-MyzwxJXRw,0,Ugz9_OYasUPfNdQkhuB4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

A period of mountain-building was also underway (the so-called Taconic orogeny) increasing the amount of rock weathering taking place and subsequently lowering CO2 levels even further. The evidence is definitely there for a short-term disruption of the carbon cycle. Another important factor is the sun. During the Ordovician, it would have been several percent dimmer according to established nuclear models of main sequence stars. Surprisingly, this raises the CO2 threshold for glaciation to a staggering 3000 ppmv or so. This also explains (along with the logarithmic forcing effect of CO2) why a runaway greenhouse didn't occur: with a dimmer sun, high CO2 is necessary to stop the Earth freezing over. In summary, we know CO2 was probably very high coming into the Late Ordovician period, however the subsequent dip in CO2 was brief enough not to register in the GEOCARB model, yet low enough (with the help of a dimmer sun) to trigger permanent ice-formation. Effectively it was a brief excursion to coldness during an otherwise warm era, due to a coincidence of conditions.‚Äù CO2 levels dropped but very briefly. That plus a dimmer sun and Earth had ice. The issue is you guys are confusing a glaciation with a snow ball. It wasn‚Äôt a large ice age. It was some brief cooling and some brief ice sheets in a very warm period in Earths history. We know the current warming caused by humans is definitely CO2. Us pumping tons of it into the air is acting as a greenhouse causing Earth to warm. https://www.google.com/amp/s/climate.nasa.gov/evidence.amp You can‚Äôt just say myths to fit your, well, whatever thing your trying to prove. That fact is CO2 is a greenhouse gas. The more you put in the air the warmer Earth‚Äôs temperature gets. Current CO2 is at 415 ppmv. The highest 5 million years and the last time CO2 was that high, temperatures globally were 3¬∞C warmer than today. There was no ice on Greenland then but there was ice on Antarctica. CO2 levels could be as high as 1,000 ppmv by 2100. That last time CO2 was that high was during the Palogene over 50 million years ago. During this time Earth warmed 5-8¬∞C in 20,000 years and the peak Hearing during this time was almost 10¬∞C hotter than today. Earth was ice free. The reason for this warm period was all because of CO2. The main cause is unknown but CO2 did warm the planet than. And the greenhouse effect is occurring. If we were to remove all the CO2 out of the air alone, Earth would be way to cold for life. But if we had too much CO2.

If you compare the West Coast, we see similar temperatures up to Portland and Vancouver than in Europe. Although, sure, it is on a much thinner strip. But at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyAuWeoTm2s&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a> you clearly show a circulation map with a cold current around the East Coast of America and a warm one on the West Coast, similar to the warm current in Europe.<br />Add to that the fact that Europe has 2 and a half inland seas (the Mediterranean, the Baltic and the North Sea that, although connected to the Arctic, is still continental crust meaning shallow waters ‚Äî¬†also keep in mind that&#39;s the case for the English Channel and the Irish Sea), then the warmer temperatures and, most importantly, warmer winters make sense. Water acts as a buffer since it takes much longer to cool down than land. That&#39;s why part of Russia that are at the same latitude as the UK are much much colder. Scotland, for example, is further North than Moscow. It&#39;s a lot warmer, though. Same goes for Norway. If you stick to the US, San Francisco and Sacramento are basically at the same latitude as Washington DC.<br /><br /><br />Now, would ice melting completely nullify those currents? Well, sure, there have been examples of the Gulf Stream halting to a stop and all. But salinity is not the only thing driving these currents. It&#39;s also trade winds that are linked to the Coriolis effect. And whatever you do, water to the south will be warmer, pushing it to the surface and making it expand, while colder water will sink.<br /><br /><br />But sure, climate is complex and it will be a whole mess.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As for a word that means &quot;less salty&quot;?

I've observed you do a lot of reacting to what somebody else said to you, rather than what the person who's talking to you actually says. Seems you're mostly looking for a fight. You put words in others' mouths so you can argue against them. And try to one-up people based on what term they use, even when it has nothing to do with the point (eg. I say melting ""land ice"" raises sea-level then you correct me that the term is ""glacier"" rather than simply focussing on sea-level rise). Not very pleasant. Seems that climate gives you a lot of meaning in life. Almost like it's a religion you can't acknowledge another person's counter-point on (because you don't want climate to lose meaning to you).

Imagine a scientist reporting back to the government that there were no serious environmental issues he was able to find. You know what happens to that scientist? No more funding, because no more problems. The media, politicians, environmental groups make a living by exagerating problems that await. It is the reason why tragic prediction continually end up being wrong. You sound like you're falling prey to them. Not to mention it's not hard to find scientists who disagree. Those with no political agenda typically do. In my observation they tend to have a lot more data and logic in their conclusions. Skip what ""scientists"" say, since you don't knoe their motive. Better to look at broad reaching scientific data that both sides agree upon (like Al Gore's chart of Temp-CO2 that actually shows temp leading CO2. Al Gore didn't mention that part in his movie. I wonder why) Don't allow others to dictate it to you. Analyze it yourself. Use logic, reason, practicality.

But the temperature back then was about the same as it is today. Some alarmist websites say it was 3 degrees warmer. But they're comparing the low of the Holocene (little ice age), to the high of 3-5 million yrs ago. It was the same temperature back then, except they didn't have glacial periods (I assume the higher CO2 is what prevented those glacial periods). So I assume our modern elevated CO2 will prevent future glacial periods, which I think you're saying too. But given the data, I don't think it will cause much higher temperatures.

That was changed in Milankovitch cycles. CO2 and temperatures stabilized and global temperatures were very stable throughout the Holocene with some very slight regional warming and coolings through out the epoch. As for I want an ice age. Um no, I don‚Äôt. The reason why I think we should stop human caused global warming is that humans can not survive a world that‚Äôs 4¬∞C to 5¬∞C hotter than today. Not been seen for tens of millions of years. A hot house won‚Äôt be good for humanity. But an ice age won‚Äôt be good either. The current interglacial is fine. The Holocene is the reason why humans arose. So anything much warmer or colder would be bad. Now are their positives to global warming? Yes, some, but are out weighed by the negatives. And the cooling we were seeing before Anthropoecene warming, we were not going to see another glacial period for another 20,000 years. And human caused global warming has already delayed the next ice age by 100,000+ years or even permanently. Some scientists think we may have even ended the Quanterney period all together.

So during an ice age Earth goes through orbital cycles known as Milankovitch cycles. This changes that amount of solar output hitting the earths surface. This warms the planet releasing CO2 and other greenhouse gasses this warming the planet. This happens through climate feedback loops and earth enters an warm interglacial period. These changes are slow, taking about 10,000 years the planet warms about 5¬∞C during this time. Which is pretty fact on geologic timescale though not nearly as fast as the current warming. Than once in your in an interglacial, earths climate is stable. I‚Äôll pop a link to how Milankovitch cycles work and their effect on Earths climate system. https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/",UCNrXngTy7SQf0tDWQ88qefQ,1,Ugzf64oXIoH-HhOOqpJ4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Every school child (should know) knows that 70k to 20k years ago much of Europe and North America was covered by glaciers. The remnants of these glaciers are still visible as they steadily recede alias melt. What made the glaciers start melting 20k years ago? Global warming. When did the industrial age begin? Roughly two hundred years ago. That leaves 18k years of melting without humans polluting the atmosphere to any significant degree. The problem with environmental activists tying everything to global warming is that the truth is there's no way to stop global warming or even slow it down and the minute this concept is discredited the need for reducing atmospheric pollution also will be discredited by people who want cheap energy, fertilizer and plastic products from fossil fuels. Unfortunately there are still a lot of us who were taught that the frightening part of polluting the atmosphere wasn't the warming part but the tipping point when a new ice age would begin.

There are many factors that can reverse that warming (for a relatively short time). Each one is a the potential straw that breaks the camels back. Not just CO2. Normally, other factors have enough time to balance the scales. E.g., in previous ice ages CO2 was much higher. But irradiance from the Sun was lower than today. Which created a balance. Fast changes in either threw things off balance. (This is true for a myriad of other things too) It's the rate of change that's disconcerting. Human activity is definitely pushing that balance. But nature has been doing the same for the last 11700 years. We live at a time during a 405 thousand year cycle when the Earth's orbit is most circular (this is apart from the 100 year Milankovitch cycle...which has also aligned to cause more warming) On top of that. The Sun also has cycles of irradiance. And it too is irradiating more since it's minimum during the mini-Ice Age...and will do so for the next 2000+ years. (I.e. The Sun is gonna be hotter) So human activity is just one factor. A significant factor yes. But removing the human factor won't remove what's coming.

Cold winters, not so cold winters it&#39;s on a wheel, what goes around comes around. Just because we can&#39;t see where it began means we can&#39;t know when it will reverse the trend. I know for sure and for certain our climate change will not destroy or harm the earth or make it uninhabitable. Because God said in Genesis¬† <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyAuWeoTm2s&amp;t=8m22s"">8:22</a> While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. {While...: Heb.

It&#39;s going to be long <br />1. it&#39;s false that global warming creates a new iceage. According to that logic PETM (Paleocene - Eocene thermal maximum) caused an iceage??? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ And You mean tropics will get warmer and poles cooler, so tropics will reach 60*c avg and poles will hit -90*c avg????? are you joking???? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<br />2. Points are here . Co2 increases temperature. Now co2 content is highest in last 35 million years. last time it was this high, antarctic ice just started forming. means very soon antarctic ice is going to melt to that level of initial glaciation. And it won&#39;t stop. It can actually reach to PETM level when earth was thriving with tropical biodiversity due to global warming. <br />3. in nature , if you notice, every thing, process, etc, when about to stop, becomes a little more aggressive or unstable, ex- flame starts flickering before getting extinguished. Similarly, seasons get destabilized before ceasing to exist. means soon tropics and temperate zones will stop wittnessing heavy seasonal temperature and rainfall changes. Earth will be a tropical paradise. <br />4. Earth&#39;s axial tilt changes, solar cycle etc doesn&#39;t determine earth&#39;s surface temp coz they have been happening since 4.5 billion years still we have evidence of hottest Mesozoic era and PETM, Triassic, late Permian, late devonian etc. So it all depends on co2 level. <br />6. Desertification actually decreases average global temp. coz a lighter coloured ground of desert reflects more sunlight than the darker tone of tropical rain forest. So co2 actually increases atmospheric water vapor content which in turn increases global temperature ana global rainfall amount. causing wide spreading of tropical forests. <br />So It&#39;s a super global warming period is what coming, not a fake iceage theory.",UCcfl45Olv63_OqXOATzddig,0,UgyjF0muLVaO8vcDujR4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Your argument relies on the notion that solar and cosmic forces have little to no impact on earth's climate. As I previously stated, climate change = human forcing + natural forcing. Let's say A is natural forcing, B is human forcing, C is total climate change. So, A + B = C. If I show that solar and cosmic forces have a significant impact on earth's climate, the entire equation is changed. It will also show that, no, the models DO NOT include all natural variabilities and that human forcing is certainly not the cause of 100% of the global warming. Hopefully we can agree on this basic logic.

They have forgotten the natural order of things. Natural Selection always has its way. This is the way of it. Their recent obscure and vile desperate attempts (their last best efforts) to restart civilization will fail. Although it may cause pain and panic among the populace, we will nevertheless witness their epic recall or demise.¬†This is the way. <br /><br />Earth is on a prophetic course toward a great transformation and must revitalize itself to regenerate and renew life for its much needed systems (Geo, Bio, hydro.. etc). If we are aware that our universe is expanding, we must also be cognizant that the solar systems, galaxies, and planetary consciousness within, are also expanding, especially those teaming with life, such as our most beloved Mother Earth - Gaia. In the timeless, all matters are relative.¬†Every evolution taking place in the universe is also taking place in the cosmos, the solar systems, planets, and all beings at the cellular level. For this reason, we are indivisible and inseparable from Divine Intelligence, the Infinite Source and Creator that binds all Multiverse, Omniverse, Universe, sub-verses and Creations together as One. What we do to another we do to ourselves and vice versa for we are One.<br /><br />Our purpose at this point in time is to learn to activate and raise our Consciousness through prayers and/or meditations by going inward to merge our imbalanced minds with the Silence of the Sacred Heart. This resulting balance and peace will enable us access to our internal and mighty compass, and forge a sacred alliance that will help us raise our consciousness and align humanity to nature¬†with love and compassion, for the transmutation of the self-destructive matrix and ascending transformation of Gaia and all species.¬†<br /><br />This is inevitable. It is up to us how benevolent nature will follow course. This will also determine how we will fair in the upcoming mini ice age in 10-15 years, if not sooner. Thought is energy and energy is life. The energy we allow to dominate our minds is the experience or fruits of the womb we will harvest. We collectively have the power to delay or expedite matters of the heart, and to transform our lives, our beautiful planet, our NOW of Time effectively and indefinitely. Humanity and all species are the collective consciousness of Earth. We are the earth in mind, heart, body and spirit. Rest not our minds on fear and thoughts of separation, illusion, division or confusion. Give permission to the Inner Self, our Mighty Compass and verbally allow this Divine Light to fuse our hearts and minds so that together we raise our collective consciousness to bring about global peace enabling love and compassion to take seat in all aspects of our lives, for our highest light path and the highest good and joy of all.",UCTRdJf2-ppV6XTsovN_o1EQ,0,UgwJUgfa26UOOuOhUep4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Another thing there are only 1 billion cars in the world. Most of the &quot;co2s&quot; are absorbed by trees and greenery. It is too heavy to stay in the upper atmosphere. In my city in the 70s and early 80s we got many smog days in the summer during those hot and muggy periods of the summer and fall. It was the norm. We rarely get 1 now during the summer.

Land tends to warm up and cool down much quicker than oceans. This way during hot periods areas like Sahara will greatly warm up while colder Atlantic air will remain pretty cold (compared to Sahara). Currently wind blows mostly from Sahara to ocean because it is sucked by ocean winds but when they stop, then the only thing driving winds will be density difference. Obviously hot Saharan air will be less dense and will cause sucking colder, humid air from above the ocean to be sucked on land. This will reintroduce vegetation, lakes, rivers and even seas to Sahara similarly how it happened roughly 12k years ago when famous Atlantis was the biggest &quot;seaside&quot; city located where we have only sand. Surely we&#39;ll have much colder climate up north but at the same time we&#39;ll gain huge area of habitable, humid space.

And he later forgot to include a crucial aspect from early on: ""the westerlies"" pushing warm water towards Europe. As long as the AMOC stays intact, it will keep Europe warmer. Second, he makes no mention of solar activity. The Maunder Minimum etc. are closely related to solar activity cycles, specifically the 115 year cycle. Right now we're at a minimum, yet still temperatures rise globally and now even in the Antarctic ice cap shrinks. In about 60 years there's the solar maximum. This further speeds up ice melt, and I don't think there is any telling of what effect this will have at the deep ocean current. The massive cold ""unsalty"" water dump can drastically slow down the deep current, but if in 60 - 70 years there isn't much Arctic ice left to melt anymore... that dump is over really fast. Third, the more Arctic ice retreats, the more the cool surrounding meltwater retraits too, that creates a northern barrier for both the westerlies and AMOC. Fourth, the past years we've seen cold air being pushed down from the Arctic, particularly in N-America. With ever more ice melting, this push weakens. Meaning warmer air farther up north. Which then ties into the end of my second point. But at this point much is still speculation.

Nothing we do has the slightest impact on this fundamental balancing process of the planet. We do other things that are extremely harmful to the environment: nuclear waste, plastic waste, overfishing and other irresonsible exploitations of the natural world, depleted uranium munititions, chemical and toxic waste and so on. But CO2 is not on this list. Claiming that it is betrays an almost complete ignorance of the planet you are living on. Carbon is what all life on the planet is made of, which is why plants are so hungry for it. They in turn remove the carbon atoms from CO2 molecules and the end result is oxygen. So by insisting on this deranged fantasy that CO2 is pollution you are saying that oxygen, the end product of CO2, is pollution. It is hard to imagine a more imbecilic viewpoint - one that befits the atomized zombies of the three TV-watching generations of humans in world history. There is nothing so stupid and degenerate that you can't be made to believe it when televized propaganda is applied. Again: this has NOTHING to do with science or protecting the environment. It has to do with political power, economics and oligarchical genocide of poor people, who are the only ones affected by the rampant increases in food prices and deindustrialization caused by the absurd nonsense being peddled as the ""solutions"" to your imaginary problem.

Faint Sun Paradox,Snowball Earth and the Hot House Equilibrium. The faint sun paradox is not a paradox. It is another evidence of how strong the terrestial force Ice Albedo is and therefore again the continental distribution. Even with a 25% lesser sun, Oceans occur,hence the term ""paradox"".While precambrian snowball effects due to a supercontinent at the south pole, demonstrate the lesser sun effect. The so called paradox underlines the trumendos forcings of Albedo and it describes the fundamental drive towards a hot house equilibrium whenever the poles are uncovered by land. This Basic heating Trend that is strong enough to even compensate the faint sun paradox puts CO2 further away from having any thermal influence. This basic heat trend is documented by all the terminations of glacial epoches and even more so in the precambrian, with a barrier where no more heating seems possible.

Small variations in the level are normal, just because the absorbtion rate varies. I also know that the CO2 level was at an all time high of 24% during the precambrian geological era, also known as snowball earth. So the entire planet was frozen solid at the moment of its greatest CO2 concentration. So much for this idiotic link between CO2 and warming. It is even easy to understand why: all the plants were fucking dead, so for millions of years atmospheric CO2 was retained. Then once plant cover returned in the Cambrian the CO2 was scrubbed right out, as indeed it is being at this very moment. Plants are able to eat all the CO2 spewed forth by volcanoes, much more than the human species has ever produced just from a single eruption. This entire thing is nothing more than addled nonsense.

There is a 60 year cycle that happens if the earth is warming or cooling and has done so for thousands of years, that we can find its imprint. When the earth is in a cooling trend, such as in the early days of the little ice age, the 30 years of the warming half cancels a portion of the cooling. Then the 30 years of the cooling half increases it. When the earth is in a warming trend, such as since the end of the last phase of the little ice age, in the early 1800's, the trend can be even be¬†reverse temporarily, such as in the 1960's, when the temperature fell slightly. From 1970's to 2000 we were in a warming trend AND a warming half of the cycle, so it warmed rapidly. Since then there has been a period when only the other cycles are doing anything. Two El Nino's (still no one knows what causes them or if there is any cycle to them) and the hot side of a 12 year cycle made the last half of the 2010's look hot. It is a fact that in a control environment, co2 WILL cause an increase, but the truth is not that simple. The earth is not an enclosed environment. Study have proven that the atmospheric¬†sensitivity to an increase in co2 is less than .5¬∞C per doubling. That means that if co2 increases from 400 ppm to 800 ppm by 2100, the total increased caused by co2 AND all feedbacks¬†would be .5¬∞.

I've been a mechanical engineer for 40 years and make a living running computer simulations of structures. So I know a thing or two about the limits of what conclusions can be drawn from simulations. So yeah, I understand the reasoning. Do you? Engineers have an adage: ""If you torture data long enough, it will tell you anything you want to hear."" I have several beefs about how we're approaching climate change: (1) There's no accountability for the predictions because there are no metrics for the accuracy. It's one thing to predict a certain reduction in, say, the rise of the sea-level. But we're not even doing that. In the equation, CO2 is an input, not an output. Making a goal of an input is useless if there is no continuous comparison to the output. It's great to make a goal of reducing CO2, but is that reduction providing enough of the desired end effect? If it doesn't provide the desire effect, who is accountable for that failure? No one? (2) There is very little evidence that there has been any thought given to the validity of the risk assessment and the effectiveness of the risk management. Climate change is indeed a real risk. But how severe of a risk, really? Might they be fear-mongering a gullible population and making feel-good proposals to virtue-signal that doing something is better than doing nothing? Money is a limited resource. Everything has an return on investment (ROI). The equation must always begin with ""How much money are we willing to spend?"" and the answer is NOT ""The cost doesn't matter because we must do this."" For every proposal to reduce sea-level rise, I want to know up front how much money will be spent, what the ROI is predicted to be, and milestones along the way to measure whether or not it's working as predicted. And it if falls short of predictions, then you re-calculate the ROI to decide if the money isn't better spent elsewhere so that you don't throw good money after bad. And if you say that the climate is too complex to hold people accountable for the accuracy of the predictions, then what's your rationale for being so certain that we know what changes have to occur? They're not talking about running experiments to test theories. They're acting like it they are already certain of it, and there is so much money at stake they are going to be very motivated to maintain the consensus. (3) Among climatologists, there isn't even agreement over whether or not the current trends can be halted (outputs like sea-level rise, not inputs like CO2 emissions). Some say that it is already too late. If true, then there is little value to throwing money at preventing a disaster that is inevitable at some uncertain time in the future, just because the ones who want their pet programs to be funded are hawking the notion, ""Doing something is better than doing nothing."" That's a conflict of interest, and billions of dollars are at stake. My being skeptical of the effectiveness of the proposals is justified.",UC6Z-0AIWy1MSY9G_7G2PwLQ,1,Ugy2eBQ-c82J5s6kTGF4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

More concerning though is our magnetic field and its rapid decrease that has been occurring in the last 50 years, so much so that we could possibly have a reversal in the next 20 to 100 years, we know it happens approx every 12,000 years and its been 12,000 years since the last reversal, that coupled with a decreasing magnetic shield letting in more space weather is very concerning and yet, we focus on fossil fuel usage. Ah well, The climate has so many factors and what upsets me the most is the simplicity it is presented to the public, Basically the climate normally does this so if its different it has to be because of humans. We have learnt more in the last 15 years about the Sun alone than we ever knew in total, Id be curious when this information is added to climate models.

Back in 2004, Roland Emmerich (the director famous for &quot;Independence Day,&quot;) made a Climate-Change fueled sci-fi movie about Global Warming reaching such a hostile pinnacle that the &quot;Gulf Stream,&quot; or &quot;North Atlantic Current,&quot; lost all salinity due to rampant melting polar ice, and completely shut down. What makes this film fictional is the idea that the current shutting down caused an immediate planetary climate-holocaust that affected the entire Northern Hemisphere, and a month-long, planet-wide blizzard that covered everything down to Mexico and Africa in hundreds of feet of snow. <br /><br /><br />Now, obviously, the speed at which this event happened was entirely fictional. No Ice Age ever came about in a matter of weeks or months. It came about in YEARS, if not centuries. But the fundamental theory that shapes the film, according to this video, is absolutely plausible! If the North Atlantic Current (which powers the entire world&#39;s current-system by sheer momentum) were to break down. The ocean&#39;s natural recycling of warm water to northern climates would cease. Over time, this would cause an equalization of Earth&#39;s latitudinal temperature rules, causing hightened warming at the equator, but excessive cooling at the polar ice caps. The ice caps themselves would, over centuries, replenish their ice sheets and traditional cycles, but at the expense of the warm-temperate climate, worldwide, that enabled mankind to dominate the Earth to begin with. <br /><br /><br />As this video points out; it would happen VERY SLOWLY, (over a century&#39;s length, at the very fastest) so none of us alive now would ever live to see the final result. It might even be happening right at this moment, but since we&#39;re at the very beginning of this process, none of us can notice. To us, the Earth seems to be still warming. It&#39;ll take years, if not decades, for that momentum we are all used to seeing, to slow to a stop. Decades beyond that to move in the opposite direction. Nothing by Earth&#39;s standards moves fast. If an Ice Age of our own cause is approaching, it is not us, but our children, and most prominently our grandchildren, who will face the consequences. &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; appears to be a not only plausible, but LIKELY, outcome of our fiddling with nature. It just won&#39;t happen at &quot;Hollywood Speed.&quot; It&#39;ll happen at (pardon the expression) a &quot;glacial&quot; pace. We&#39;ll live long enough to see the beginning of the process, but none of us will ever live long enough to see the end result of it. <br /><br /><br />And none of us may want to.

If the whole ice of poles melt than there will not be any heat differences in the water which cause to stop streams. If streams stop than seasons stop to change. However cold pole icy water affects the weather and turn it to colder. Again if green gas consantration is too high to create a barrier between sun and crust than the heat of sun will have no effect on crust tempature to increase. All and all we know whole ice of poles will not melt so quick and even it is not so possible in long term.<br />3. However if equator region becomes more hotter than today than thermodynamics works again and oceans streams keep continue to flow.<br />4. The main problem about grean house gas and plastic (micro &amp; macro) pollution on oceans has big negative effect on sea life and phytoplankton which produces ~70% of oxygen. <br />5. Heat on crust cause fires at forest. Forest is the skeleton system of plant life, rain, agriculture, insects and animals. If we lose forest than we lose all.

Even if high co2 levels could cause a warming this would not be enough, because it is a non accumulative gas that begins breaking down and being absorbed by all the carbon based life on the planet, and to date there has been no actual science done to show if co2 even has the ability to cause a warming affect. NASA recently released data that shows the planet is getting greener ( more plant life), which would verify that the small amount of additional co2 we are responsible for is being absorbed as fast as we are making it. Also the ocean currents are controlled by orbital influences as are the winds and the jet streams and the rivers of lava beneath our feet. The process you described wouldn‚Äôt be enough our cause the ocean currents. And the reason the currents appear to stop during ice ages is because ice sheets don‚Äôt flow very well. Interesting the global warming crowd is now doubling down saying the current and future cooling we are heading towards is because of the global warming we didn‚Äôt believe them about. üòÇ A couple of years back NASA also released data showing the Antarctic ice shelf is about 20% more in volume since we‚Äôve been keeping track. These global warming guys didn‚Äôt skip a beat and began to blame it on global warming, and then really got themselves worked up about, wait if there‚Äôs more ice then why are the ocean levels rising, it was almost complete hysteria. The oceans haven‚Äôt risen, even if all the ice melted, the oceans don‚Äôt behave like your coffee cup or bath tube. Land sinks land heaves, increased evaporations so on. It‚Äôs just another stupid scare tactic like the ocean currents, we will be drowning but some how all dying of thirst in the same sentence nonsense. Natural systems doing there natural cycles. If anything we are doing a good thing by releasing all that locked up co2, so all the carbon based life forms can thrive.",UClbExl1Tem6TW13YkykKOnQ,0,UgwPDzQaUaEdsqZ9uAp4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Those all at once periods are called tipping points. They happen with both warming and cooling periods. The earth is located in our solar system to not only be conducive to life but also one that creates a climatic spectrum of environmental factors to challenge living organisms to evolve. I know, change is hard. But we as humans can enjoy our ability to employ migratory patterns in response to our changing environment as we have always done in the past. The climate of the earth can not be viewed within the existence of human life on earth. To lends some perspective, the dinosaurs were on earth for millions of years, we have not been in existence for half a million years (plus lots of different life in between).

We are in a solar minimum period which will continue into the next cycle++ and create even more cooling. If you want to understand climatic changes, you have to understand solar cycles and solar forcing in addition to ocean oscillation, the main climate drivers. CO2 is completely irrelevant. Atmospheric particle levels were MUCH higher during periods of high volcanic activity which caused much cooler weather. Ice cores show clearly that evergreen forests once thrived on the south pole while ice was completely absent from the north polar area.These are very normal cycles that ultimately sort themselves, obviously. More CO2 = more green plants and faster tree growth. At 400 ppm, CO2 is at deficit levels for optimal plant growth. Global warming is politics, not science. Yada yada yada ... and all of those past &#39;extreme&#39; cycles happened well before industrialization and the use of fossil fuels.

Warming water is less able to absorb CO2 and would emit CO2 as the planet warmed. Water nearly doubles in its capacity to absorb CO2 between 25 C and 0 C. It also seems like the increase of water temperatures would increase water vapor in the atmosphere and increase rainfall. If equatorial winds tend to be southwest to north east, at least some rain lands at the areas north of the equator would benefit from the increased rain. Why don&#39;t we capture some of this deep ocean CO2 dissolved in water and test it&#39;s Carbon 14 level to judge how much of the carbon has been there since 1850 and before 1850?",UCiHBfVkHEq_b88n4aEyzSNQ,0,UgzaaDcTyTB1LHSHwyF4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

It&#39;s a 400 year cycle if you research it. In addition, when solar wind (among other outputs of the sun) decreases, more cosmic rays enter our atmosphere (especially as our magnetosphere lacks it&#39;s usual strength-the present condition-falling to all time lows-allowing more cosmic rays to penetrate the atmosphere). Energy from the cosmic rays increase cloud nucleation, causing more cloud formation, AND strengthens storms already in progress. The result is increased albedo, cooling the planet, more rainfall (snofall), and changing weather patterns, The sun&#39;s decreased output is even having effects on other planets in our solar system. I am not going to write a book here, but I encourage you to research these claims. You will find them to be accurate.<br />Man&#39;s contribution to the sun&#39;s output is insignificant, therefore, MAN is not responsible for the warming then subsequent cooling of our planet. Period. <br /><br />Pollution is still not acceptable, but isnt the reason our climate is changing. <a href=""https://youtu.be/gSbdiiaVmII"">https://youtu.be/gSbdiiaVmII</a>",UC5psBwDBuNgjMiU7zIrhTkA,0,UgxrNyuhwo34ZATp0SV4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

This can cause much stronger storms, including blizzards, hurricanes, tornados, and floods, so the mixing of the air masses continues and is less relevant to ocean currents. <br /><br />Perhaps with other balances as were the case with the last few ice ages, the argument might make sense, as indeed it was proposed before there was so much gathering of actual data.",UCRbYSDON2LYKFmphMVQlELw,0,UgzXeRdF5EQ1ejgfARp4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

What ended 11700 years ago was a glacial period (called the Pleistocene Epoch) within the current ice age (called the Quartenary Period) . An Ice Age has glacial and interglacial periods. Glacial periods are periods of glacial expansion (rapid global cooling) Interglacial periods are periods of glacial retreat (rapid global warming.) We are currently in an interglacial, called the Holocene Epoch (that started 11700 years ago). These periods of warming and cooling are triggered by the Melankovich cycles (these include eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, tilt of the earth's axis and precession of the Earth's axis) These factors change cyclicly. Thus they produce cycles of glaciation when certain other factors are in place (eg. ocean currents...which are mostly determined by the position of continents. As well as feedback loops. Eg. exposed continental crust near polar regions covered in snow, reflecting sunlight. etc). These state of conditions currently exist...and are responsible for the presence of ice caps. Which have been there for 2.6 million years. As long as those conditions exist and ice caps are present...we're still in an Ice Age.",UCRoJD4J407x4_r4Et46oA3g,1,Ugy--bgIppwXqdnP0yV4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

CO2 only makes up 4/10 of 1% of the gas in the atmosphere of that 4/10 of 1% humans only account for 3% nature produces 97% and of that 3% that we produce United States map produce 5% of the CO2 gases created by humans. There&#39;s not a whole lot more that the United States can do considering what we produce for the amount of CO2 gas that we produce wow India China and all of Africa create much more CO2 gas without any restrictions or any effort to a Deep Deuce their CO2 emissions. So in the end if you continue to put forth that humans are causing climate change your wrong there is not enough humans are not enough human activity because climate change because the CO2 gas in the atmosphere is 4/10 of 1% and of that humans only produce 3% that&#39;s not enough for humans to affect the climate by their production of CO2 gas. Quit wasting your time on the false narratives put forth by the climate change theorists.

Trouble is, this time there's nothing natural about the shift. The gradual changes that used to take generations not only are happening all at once, but to say it was happened with ten times the intensity, beyond anything seen in the fossil record short of asteroid impacts would be to understate the matter, and scientists have been warning us since the 1904 (not the 80s as you claim) and now folk are like 'nothing to see here, folks.' You've a lot of research to do for your own sake. See 'feedback effects' and exponential math and a little thing called entropy, especially in regards to the sudden doubling of energy addition into an increasingly enclosed medium. Hell... put two fish tanks on a sunny porch, one sealed with a big 'ol block of dry ice and both with thermometers, give 'em a while, and get back to us.

The positions of the continents and their influence on the directions ocean currents can take help define this pattern, and it's not likely to end for quite a while yet.

Nothing predicted by the IPCC has come true. Climate Change, Global Warming, or Global Cooling debate does not matter. You have been purposely distracted from ""Global Crop losses."" Go Subscribe to Ice Age Farmer, Oppenheimer Ranch Project, Adapt 2030, and Yanasa Ama Ranch to get the truth. You are running out of time to prepare. 2019, is the worse crop yeilds since before the Little Ice Age, and by the way... The Ice Core study showed that there was high CO2 levels before every Ice Age, or ""Grand Solar Minimum."" History has shown that during every Grand Solar Minimum Civilization's Collapsed because of crop losses. However, do what you want. Only the chosen who research this, and have been preparing will survive without being dependant on a Government who has no problem lying about what is happening to our Planet. If you want to pay for a carbon tax to save the Earth. Have ""they"" said how they are going to fix what they are unjustly accusing us for? Are they pressuring China, and India to get on board? No, they are using that money to pay for their Agenda 2030. A one World Government.",UCYqcCvPSKF8JhXPdyzHWvbQ,1,UgzKbe7kRr0v01lwAZ14AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

It's the Sun. The Sun goes through different cycles of Maximums, and Minimums. When the Sun was at Maximum it melted a lot of polar ice that desalinated the North Atlantic and Pacific ocean. The BP Oil spill clogged up the Gulf Stream, and those two events weakened the AMOC. There is no more warm equitorial Currents flowing into Northern Europe. Go to windy.com and click on Currents. This skipped sea level rise. The Sun is in what is called a Grand Solar Minimum. Global Warming leads to global cooling, but the Earth will not be in another ice age, or interglacial period till about 2050. However, non of this really matters. Global Warming, or Global Cooling, it's the crop losses which we all must prepare for now.

Here is one fact: I was born in a town in Siberia torn apart by thr SOVIET communists! And you completely missed another point: 1 small change and bigger events come sooner after. And 1¬∞ tilt? Are you scared of the cold? Cause the way you phrased it, you said ""1¬∞ tilt and everyone is dead"", that just states you afraid of the cold. If the poles are shifting, does that alter the weather that drastically? No. Does it alter the magnetic field that alters solar radiation and how much hits our planet? Yes. There are many things that alter our weather, not just a tilt! If the poles are switching, that just means your compass is going to be thrown off, and the magnetic field is going to have a big change. But, if the earth tilted by 1¬∞, that does not kill everyone! It would affect sunlight mainly, but the magnetic field is more the worry. Now, if we tilted 1¬∞ back, we are just colder by a big amount, unless the sun is heavy on solar activity, and that has a big role to play. If the ocean water got warmer for a short time, that also affects more than you think! The west coast of the North American Continent got warmer and that heat later hit Alaska. Alaska broke records by hitting the 90¬∞F temperature range it was not supposed to, but thanks to the Ocean warm-up. So, just a change in a small tilt has not say to kill us. There is more than you think. If the Solar activity dropped by a massive amount, the ocean water got brittle cold than normal, and we tilted by 1¬∞, then many would die. If opposite, 1¬∞ tilt would have the smallest affect than you think! There are many key-things in play.

Less Coronal holes, means less solar wind, and an increase in cosmic rays which are directly linked with increased cloud formation. This cools the earth.

Ice cores and tree rings show a huge plethora of CO2 in our atmosphere, way before man was ever a factor. This change is cyclical. A natural order. Basic science teaches that plants need CO2 to live. The lower the Co2 the more plants have to work to get it. Which means they lose more water, basically, they are drying out and becoming more flammable.

The most likely influence during this period is variable output from the sun combined with pronounced volcanic activity. We know that from the end of the LIA to the 1950s the sun‚Äôs output increased. But since WW2 the sun has slowly grown quieter, yet the temperature on Earth has gone up. The sceptical argument that current warming is a continuation of the same warming that ended the LIA is unlikely. There is a lack of evidence for a suitable forcing (e.g. the sun) and numerous correlations with known natural forcings that can account for the LIA itself, and the subsequent climate recovery. Taken in isolation, the LIA might cast doubt on the theory of climate change. Considered alongside the empirical evidence, model predictions and a century of scientific research into the climate, recovery from the LIA is not a plausible theory to explain the observed evidence and rate of global climate change- https://skepticalscience.com/coming-out-of-little-ice-age.htm",UCcRtYvNEgzhmXhtRZa5djKQ,1,UgzShVzfzBuupuGXwah4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Self sustaining pretty much with 10% of the water usage of traditional farming as it's a recirculation system. Your basicly just replacing evoporated water. Fish waste feeds the plants and the plants can feed the fish as well depending on what you are growing. We are using tillapia and when the fish get too big you can cull it and have your protein to go with the veggies. We haven't done that yet as it's not a commercial set-up (1,000 gallon tank) and they are kinda more like pets.

Faster than the natural increases in those two inputs in the environment. With the increased dynamic weather patterns causing deluges of rain fall and trade offs to extreme droughts we don't have consistent rain patterns that allows for good water soaking in the land.

I used to regularly say ""After the Ice Age ended....."" until I did a heap of reading. That's when I realised that everything I had been taught in school was the reverse of reality. Saying the Ice Age ended implies that warm is here to stay and that isn't so. We're still in the Ice Age and will be so for a long time yet. But hey, I'm still learning too. Coming into the warm period might be the reason we have agriculture and civilisation. Humans like us evolved over 100k years ago and yet did virtually nothing development wise until 10k years ago. If you look at the Greenland cores the temps really went wild in each Glacial, it's only in the Interglacial they've been steady enough to develop crops, etc. The Anthropology and Archaeology of ancient climates is really interesting.",UC9JHU3fM9XzrTKS70BJgb3w,1,Ugy50ck-KtjN5rwwIyx4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

We exited the last glaciation about 15k years bp. (Ignoring the Younger Dryas). The previous interglacials were at about 110k year intervals and none of the last 3 lasted anywhere near 15k years. The last interglacial to last as long as the current one was 410k years bp and it only lasted 10k years. I'm going by the Vostok ice cores which simply do not show what you are describing. AFAIK these are pretty definitive, so if you have data that contradicts them, I'd like to see it. And I have seen estimates that this interglacial will last 50k years. I doubt this simply because the average temperatures have been dropping for the last 8k years. The bottom of the ""Little Ice Age"", circa 1800 was the coldest the planet has been in about 8,000 years. While temps go up and down over a thousand years or so, the pattern has been that each peak is lower than the last and each trough has been colder than the last. Our current warming has not reached the Medieval Warm period temperatures yet, the MWP was cooler than the Roman Warm Period which in turn was cooler than the Minoan Warm Period.

So far, at least. The average interglacial is 15 thousand years... Glacials and interglacials are triggered when Jupiter tugs at our orbit and puts the earth in circular or elliptical orbits. The elliptical orbits last about 95 thousand years (hence the reason glaciation lasts 95 thousand years)... The circular orbits last 15 thousand years until Jupiter's next tug (hence the reason interglacials last 15 thousand years on average) All of that only applies if the right conditions exist (as they do today). Antartica being the main culprit in this story. The current interglacial is expected to be an unusually long one (regardless of human intervention)....hence the reason my estimate is 5 to 10 thousand years (which is actually a modest estimate).",UCRoJD4J407x4_r4Et46oA3g,1,Ugy50ck-KtjN5rwwIyx4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Here is an example of link for albedo: https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/misr/gallery/global_albedo_seasonal I don't know much about GCR. However I can tell you this: clouds are atmospheric humidity (water vapor) transformed into water liquid or water solid. To transform water from liquid to vapor state, energy is taken, - when evaporation occur at the ocean, or on land, it is cooling the environment. This energy is later on released in the atmosphere, when water vapor transforms into liquid or solid. Anyway the point here is: there can only be as much clouds as there is water vapor in the atmosphere. GCR won't create clouds out of nowhere. I saw on article on GCR but I could tell it was a weird article as it was denying atmospheric CO2 is increasing - something that we have measured accurately for years. Do you have a reference for an article about GCR and clouds? About the sun cycle, it is an easy exercise to answer your question. (clouds are much more complicated). Remember the equation on wikipedia: (1-a)S=4 e s T^4 you can easily calculate equilibrium T from this. I'll do it for you: S = 1367; % Solar constant a = 0.3; % Earth average albedo s = 5.67e-8; % Stefan-Boltzmann constant e = 0.612; % Effective emissivity of earth T = ((1-a)*S/(4*e*s))^(1/4) - 273.15 = 15 (degree C) now if you google solar cycle, look for images, you'll see the value of S varying between 1367 and 1365 (W m-2) if I use S = 1365 I get: T = ((1-a)*S/(4*e*s))^(1/4) - 273.15 = 14.9 (degree C) As you can see... that's not a big change. The solar cycle doesn't have a big impact on Earth climate (but milankovitch cycle does!! but on much longer time scale.) In the equation, what has changed and continue to change is global albedo (a) and the effective emissivity of Earth. If e was 1 (without atmospheric CO2), we would have: e= 1; T = ((1-a)*S/(4*e*s))^(1/4) - 273.15 = -18.3 (degree C) 33 degree C colder! So it's a good thing we have some CO2 in the atmosphere. now, if the effective emissivity of Earth was 0, that would mean that all heat is trapped on earth... at 0, the temperature would just keep increasing (there is no T equilibrium, because there's only heat going in, and no heat going out - T keeps increasing). On some planet, such as Venus, there is a lot of greenhouse gas, causing T to be very high. Average temperature on Venus is 462 degree C. In the next 2 or 3 decades, global temperature will probably continue to rise, as CO2 will increase and trap more heat.

Water gets warmer at the equator, evaporating faster than at the poles, and therefore being more salty.<br />This salty water is more dense than average water, but also warmer, allowing it to float at the surface. The water drifts form the equator to the poles (for a more complicated reason, that will be left out), loosing its heat on the way. As it cooles down, but by keeping the same density, it starts to drown through underwater waterfall currents. Also because of temperature, some water gets trapped into Ice (maybe the reason why it gets pulled to the poles in the first place?).<br />Anway, water sinks, goes to the south, comes back up, and does the route again.<br /><br /><br />What happens if we warm the wind temperatures?<br />Ice at the poles melt, letting go of more &quot;pure&quot; unsalinated water. This mixes with over-salinated water, changing its density, and stopping it from drowning back again.<br />If this current stops, cold water won&#39;t flow back to the equator, not cooling the land on its way, removing a temperature stabilisator phenomena at the same time.<br /><br /><br />So although the poles get hoter, the waters get less salty, and more &quot;floaty&quot;.<br /><br /><br />But if the equator get hoter, more wind turbulances will occure. The land in between the poles and the equator might not get wamredup as much for the waters, but maybe hoter from the winds. We will get more into the extremes, and have less &quot;stable&quot; climates.<br /><br /><br />Am I right?",UCHNEO8cZQwm_jUFNt4UkpNA,0,UgxgPs8Th417c_Q4TXl4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

When seawater freezes, it typically freezes slowly enough that water forms crystalline structures which do not leave space for the salt molecules to remain. This is why icebergs and glaciers contain freshwater. You are right in the sense that ice already in the ocean does not contribute to rising sea levels. But the point of this video is to describe how current climate change patterns causing the melting of ice in the Artic lead to an Ice Age, causing higher temperatures near the equator and lower temperatures near the north. The rising sea levels is also an issue but not caused by melting ice already in the ocean. It is a separate issue related climate change, but would also still occur in conjunction with another ice age.

Still, if the climate gets stuck in an upward spiral of self-reinforcing warming where melting permafrost releases more greenhouse gases and making it even warmer globally and so on, eventually you'll get hot again. The earth has had periods in the past when CO2 levels we're so high and the earth so warm basically everything was rainforest or deserts and there was no ice left even at the poles, and even the poles were green because of the massive amounts of floating algae was growing there, look up the carboniferous period for example. The thing is rainforest can't come out of nowhere though, it needs time to spread and build up, so if the climate warms too fast, i.e. over mere decades or centuries instead of tens or hundreds of thousands of years, you just get desert and no rainforest to regulate the climate and everything is far hotter and drier than it would have been naturally in the past at that CO2 level.

The one constant of climate is that it changes. CO2 doesn&#39;t have that big of an effect at the low quantities it is at. The atmosphere is comprised of only .04% CO2 and we have given rise to .008% in that. Not to mention Water Vapor which exists at around 22000 PPM in the atmosphere is a much bigger greenhouse gas. Has a much higher specific heat capacity than CO2 anyways CO2 sits at .84 and Water Vapor sits at 1.93 more than double with higher concentrations in the atmosphere by 50 times the amount than CO2. So lets take a step back and look at reality. Glacial and interglacials are caused by orbital patterns. The further you get from a glacial period the hotter it will get, look at any of the data from the past and it shows exactly that. People need to have a better understanding of the sudden end of the last ice age/glacial period. If a certain theory is correct then there might have been a huge impact on the natural warming process.

Ice doesn't heat up as fast as basalt in sunlight, because ice _reflects far more sunlight than basalt._ If we create an atmosphere that does not lose heat quickly, then heat (from the sun, yes) will accumulate on the planet faster, simply because the atmosphere traps more of it. Just like a blanket doesn't warm you up; it merely traps your bodyheat. 'Climate Change' is a complicated issue; in part, it's weather changes due to deforestation and desertification, in part it's weather changes due to increased temperatures affecting the oceans.

If you are right about your second statement (solar cycles), then you are wrong about your first statement (there's no such thing as global warming) because your second statement claims global warming is real (and caused by solar cycles). I'm no expert on the whole 'solar cycle' thing, so I'm gonna assume solar activity does play _a_ role in climate change (though Earth's shielding mechanisms are pretty damn good, so I'm gonna go with 'it's but a relatively small effect'), but if we look at the earth's history, then activities of life have played a monumental role in causing climate change through chemical atmospheric alteration. Human activity incorporates machines that add to that, while we've also (in the past) been stripping Earth from mechanisms that lock atmospheric greenhouse chemicals down (trees, for example). The anthropogenic element to climate change is but one of many, it's absolutely true, but if you take a bucket, put it under a dripping tap, wait until it's nearly full, and then pour half a liter of water on top of that, then denying that that half a liter of water had any influence in the bucket overflowing is just nonsense.

It is simply a fallacy to think that you can moralize your way out of a problem created by collective activity. The reality is this problem can only be solved top-down, through concerted collective efforts of entire nations. You cannot solve climate change through a change in what you consume, nearly every product and every service you use is part of a long chain of production which relies on activity that is exacerbating climate change. You cannot as an individual stop the CO2 output by megacorporations in industry and agriculture and transport. All you can do is vote for a government that will pass laws to stop these things, that will direct vast amounts of manpower and resources to undertake a change toward a sustainable infrastructure and economy. Individual activity is only a small fraction of the problem and you won't make a dent in the CO2 output even if everyone went vegan overnight and only ever used public transport, because the majority of the CO2 is produced by industry. The corporations have to be forced at gunpoint to change the way they operate because they will never do it of their own volition, no company will willingly sacrifice profits for their shareholders unless the government makes them. Hence the need to take political power and control the army. Capitalism will never stop climaten change of its own accord, it's the reason why we're in this shit in the first place. China is doing it right, they keep capitalism on a tight leash, strictly controlled by the state and they're making the biggest strides toward green, renewable energy of any country in the world.",UCpUz97TXmjDzbVWu9sTBViA,1,UgyTjbYD8uEvKNX08sp4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Lastly, 1 meter of sea level rise isn't threatening, especially when it occurs over a span of 285 years. Even Miami Beach wouldn't be threatened, at our current rate it would take 400 years for Miami to regularly flood during extreme high tides. Also, sea levels could do a lot of things, we don't know, all our ice sheets could melt in 30 years, or they could drop 110 meters by 2100. Scientist aren't prophets. So I'm going to base it off current rates, because the current rate is all we know. Lastly before sea level rises 1 meter our current warm phase will have probably ended.

It doesn&#39;t even matter if the conveyor shuts down or just continues to operate underneath the fresh water. In global heating events like what we are seeing happen in front of our faces, is that the EU is having freezing events in late May, destroying 50% of the vineyards in France and Italy. And most of the fruit and vegetable crops of the EU. <br /><br /><br />Because of the jet streams and other wind patterns from being on a rotating planet, only Europe gets hit by the cold, meaning N. American coasts get to burn while Europe freezes to death. <br /><br /><br />The equatorial regions see a mild increase of 1/6th the temperature increases at the poles, also due to the spinning globe transporting all the latent heat in the evaporating ocean waters, towards the poles. <br /><br /><br />The only time that North Atlantic conveyor belt shuts down is if a very large chunk of land ice actually breaks off of Greenland and plops into the ocean. This is probably why there is conflicting data sets on if that conveyor is shutting down. In the summer chunks of ice fall into the ocean, causing hiccups, and in the winter everything usually freezes, making it function normal.<br /><br /><br />Now look up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23noplant19"">#noplant19</a> on Twitter to see what climate chaos looks like to a farmer.",UCyLp6dGGba_B3QeOJIjF68Q,0,UgwgrOVwwgNs4bUq4mp4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

America in winter as cold as the Arctic sometimes. Here at Lake Huron I checked on January 21, 2019 and the air at 7,000 feet above sea level was colder than the air at 7,000 feet over any of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS), 2/3rds of the Arctic Ocean and most of Siberia. It's ridiculous. The global warming has fucked up the Jet Stream so much that the North Pole cold is sometimes 3,000 km south over James Bay and the north pole is warmer. Right now it's 7.5 degrees on June 4, 2019 at Lake Huron. The coast of Greenland is warmer. It's all fucked up here in eastern N. America.

What caused the end of the MWP and the beginning of the Little Ice Age (LIA) is up for debate and the two leading contenders I&#39;ve seen for what caused it to end are volcanic activity and solar activity. The coldest period of the LIA began in the 1600s, by which time solar activity was being monitored, so we know that in the 1600s solar activity decreased greatly and entered what called a Grand Solar Minimum. This grand solar minimum is referred to as the Maunder Minimum named after the scientist who was measuring daily solar activity at that time. In 1815 the eruption of Mount Tambora caused a volcanic winter which lasted for a number of years and caused the year without a summer in 1816. After the effects of the Tambora eruption subsided the earth began to warm until the 1940s when a global cooling trend began which lasted until the the late 1970s. This is why in the 1970s many scientists and some government agencies were concerned about or predicting the beginning of a new ice age. Here are a couple of examples of the kind of news articles I was reading in the 1970s and what I was seeing on TV.<br /><br />U.S. and Soviet Press Studies of a Colder Arctic<br />&quot;The United States and the Soviet Union are mounting large‚Äêscale investigations to determine why the Arctic climate is becoming more frigid, why parts of the Arctic sea ice have recently become ominously thicker and whether the extent of that ice cover contributes to the onset of ice ages.&quot;<br /><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/18/archives/us-and-soviet-press-studies-of-a-colder-arctic-us-and-soviet-press.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/18/archives/us-and-soviet-press-studies-of-a-colder-arctic-us-and-soviet-press.html</a><br /><br />The Cooling World <br /><br />&quot;Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change, or even to allay its effects. They concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed, such as melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers, might create problems far greater than those they solve.&quot;<br /><a href=""http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/newsweek-coolingworld.pdfClimatologists"">http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/newsweek-coolingworld.pdfClimatologists</a> are<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_861us8D9M"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_861us8D9M</a><br /><br />Beginning in the 1970s solar activity began to increase causing NASA&#39;s Skylab to crash to earth earlier than expected and by the late 1970s/1980s cooling had stopped and warming began. <br /><br />&quot;Greater-than-expected solar activity heated the outer layers of Earth&#39;s atmosphere and increased drag on Skylab. By late 1977, NORAD also forecast a reentry in mid-1979; a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist criticized NASA for using an inaccurate model for the second most-intense sunspot cycle in a century, and for ignoring NOAA predictions published in 1976.&quot;<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab</a><br /><br /><br />In the 1980s and 90s solar activity increased to the highest level seen in modern times and is called the Modern Solar Maximum. In the early 2000s solar activity began to decrease which caused the global warming pause. Since the early 2000s there has been no &quot;significant&quot; warming and the small amount of warming that has occurred is far below the predictions made by climate models. Based on the paleoclimate record grand solar minimums occur about every 400 years and the last grand solar minimum occurred 400 years ago. The last two 11-year solar cycles have seen a huge decrease in solar activity which mirrors the solar activity seen at the beginning of the Maunder Minimum in the 1600s. <br /><br />Here is a BBC report from 2015 about the decreasing solar activity: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DueVWamHmYs"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DueVWamHmYs</a><br /><br />Here is a news article from 2018: The Chill of Solar Minimum - As 2018 comes to an end, the Thermosphere Climate Index is on the verge of setting a Space Age record for Cold. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not there quite yet,‚Äù says Mlynczak, ‚Äúbut it could happen in a matter of months.‚Äù<br /><a href=""https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2018/09/27/the-chill-of-solar-minimum/"">https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2018/09/27/the-chill-of-solar-minimum/</a><br /><br />Here is a documentary about the Little Ice Age: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFXZ0bATyc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFXZ0bATyc</a><br /><br />By the way, during the Little Ice Age witchcraft and Satan were blamed for climate change.

Your right to say that there will be another ice age but saying humans will cause it is a joke. You could take the entire population of the world and give them a 2 bedroom house on a 1/3rd of an acre and put them in the state of Texas and still have a 1/3rd of the state to grow all the food needed to feed people. The Sun is going to sleep and we will get cooler. The Chinese have history of this happening. The dynasties there always begin coming out of a solar minimum and end in the middle of the next. About 400 years on average as populations get larger then the planet cools causing less food to grow leading to starvation in some of the population until it ends at which point it starts to warm. more food is grown and people start making babies again because the food supply grows as well.

If the Greenland ice sheet melted it would only rise sea 7.2m. Not enough to stop the ocean current. <br /><br />The Little Ice Age was caused by a Grand Solar Minimum called the Maunder Minimum. A weakened solar magnetic field leaves the earth more susceptible to cosmic rays penetrating our lower atmosphere. Cosmic rays initiate nucleation, which is how clouds form. With more cloud cover reflecting sunlight, the planet cools. <br /><br />The jet-streams in our upper atmosphere which keep the cold air at the poles, also seem to be affected by GSM. They become more wavy and events like the Polar Vortex, which America experienced this year, can happen more often. <br /><br />The U.S. has just gone through it&#39;s coldest wettest winter in a hundred years.

We have no doubt kicked the planet into a territory which is unprecedented in recent geological history towards far warmer times where tropical forests grew in the higher latitudes. As my professor for atmospheric physics said we have taken a sledgehammer to the Earth climate system.<br /><br /><br />Additionally the breakdown of circulation has profound negative consequences for marine life since it allows the waters to stagnate and probably become anoxic a process that is already occurring in places with the expansion of the oxygen minimum zone meaning sea life is going to be very difficult .,UC2vXqt1H_1nkVF9Px_RyLKw,0,UgxqZgpI3Ss6Bx3cZNN4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

4097,UgzNZLSryA8FzZXif654AaABAg,0.0,0,2019-06-04 12:37:07,ShadowMatter,Not all studies are created equal that being said you&#39;re leaving out a massive piece of the puzzle and by you&#39;re I mean climatologists but since the piece of the puzzle they&#39;re leaving out is outside of their wheelhouse it&#39;s almost understandable I mean they&#39;re climatologists not solar physicists<br /><br />Let me go ahead and jump in here and say that there are a million and one reasons why we need to stop poisoning our planet and things need to be done about that immediately if not sooner with that being said<br /><br />To clarify what I mean here let me preface this by saying the 90 something percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and man-made line of bullshit the news media tries to feed us comes from a single conglomerate study that&#39;s a decade-old that only counted scientific papers put out by climatologists at the time that took a hardcore stance on whether or not climate change was man-made and real if the paper did not take a stance either way or only took a stance on either it being real or it being man-made they were not included so the end result only included roughly 30% of the climate papers available at the time a decade ago<br /><br />Since then the bread and butter of securing funding for further research for climatologists has been anything having to do with climate change and this has resulted in some dishonesty cherry picking of results and poor interpretations a lot of times just by leaving out highly significant variables<br /><br />Most climate papers studies and ergo the simulations and predictions based on them only count one type of solar forcing and that is UV exposure which only counts a 4% variance in irradiance which is negligible and occasionally you&#39;ll find a study that factors in sunspot variability when in reality there is closer to a dozen different types of solar forcing and many of the other types have a vastly greater impact on our planet and When taking into account they paint a entirely different picture as to why our climate has been changing<br /><br />There is one significant piece of evidence that is counted as scientific fact Undisputed and simultaneously somehow has flown under the radar of climatologists whether intentionally or by accident and that is the fact that every planet in our solar system has experienced a significant change in climate during the same time periods as Earth knowing that fact you can realize that either somehow driving your car here on Earth affects the temperature of every planet in the solar system or these solar system-wide changes in climate are being caused by something that affects the solar system as a whole and there is only one thing that can do that and that&#39;s the Sun.<br /> has the sun been doing anything interesting during this period Of time possibly something that correlates with the observation that every planet in the Solar System&#39;s climate has experienced a significant change yes there is the Sun goes through Cycles where it is more and less active and while most people are familiar with the seven-year sunspot cycle they are unaware of the larger 400-year activity cycle known as the grand solar maximum Grand solar minimum cycle and if we look at geological evidence and historic records of the climate 400 years ago we come across a time in our history known as the maunder minimum sometimes nicknamed the mini ice age<br /><br />I know what you&#39;re thinking you&#39;re thinking but the climate is getting hotter not colder but let me tell you that&#39;s the thing the way the solar Cycles work you hit the peak of grand solar maximum right before the start of grand solar minimum and in 2018 the sun started going long periods of time without a single sunspot currently the sun is so inactive that the number of sunspots as of June 4th 2019 hasn&#39;t exceeded double-digits in the preceding decades it was not uncommon to have literally hundreds of sunspots on the sun simultaneously<br /><br />The other problem with the man-made climate change argument is the fact that greenhouse gases compose of 0.1% of our atmosphere and of that 0.1% carbon dioxide only accounts for 4% and of that carbon dioxide Mankind&#39;s contribution accounts for 3.4%<br />So just for emphasis the whole of Mankind&#39;s contribution to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in total is 3.4% of 4% of 0.1%<br /><br />That&#39;s so small of an amount it&#39;s ridiculous to think that it has even the faintest hope of changing the average temperature by even one one hundredth of a degree that&#39;s like putting a drop of boiling water into a swimming pool and thinking it&#39;s going to change the temperature<br /><br />There&#39;s a YouTube channel that has a video series on this it goes into far more detail the name of the channel is Suspicious Observers if you need any references

The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era ‚Äî and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth‚Äôs orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal. - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.1 Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate. The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response. Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth‚Äôs climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warmin The evidence for rapid climate change is compelling: Global Temperature Rise The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year ‚Äî from January through September, with the exception of June ‚Äî were the warmest on record for those respective months. 5 Warming Oceans The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969. The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.6 Shrinking Ice Sheets The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade Glacial Retreat Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world ‚Äî including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.

The leading hypothesis is that the end-Permian extinction was caused by massive volcanic eruptions that spewed more than 4 million cubic kilometers of lava over what is now known as the Siberian Traps, in Siberia, Russia. Such immense and sustained eruptions likely released huge amounts of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide into the air, heating the atmosphere and acidifying the oceans."" The End-Permian extinction reminds me of the sudden death of 1,700 people living near Lake Nyos located in the Cameroon Volcanic Line in August 21, 1986. A huge quantity of volcanic gas including CO2 was trapped at the bottom of Lake Nyos under water pressure. The warm water at the top of the lake was unable to sink to the bottom because of its lower density. Therefore, the CO2 was trapped in the bottom where the temperature was lower. However, on that fateful day, an earthquake and possibly one or more landslide disrupted the concentrated CO2 at the bottom of the lake and cause huge quantity of CO2 to rise up to the surface of the lake. ""an explosive degassing of 1.6 million tons of carbon-dioxide occurred, forming a 160 feet high cloud. The invisible and odorless carbon dioxide was heavier than normal air and the cloud descended quickly from the slopes of Nyos and filled the surrounding valleys, covering the villages with an asphyxiating blanket of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is toxic, and at concentrations of 6-8 percent (the normal concentration in the atmosphere is 0.04 percent ) it causes almost immediate unconsciousness and death. "" (For comparison, the scare mongering ""high"" concentration about 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere today is only 0.04% , or about 0.57% of the concentration that is toxic to humans. Therefore, it is foolish to talk about the CO2 at today's level as if it were as dangerous as the sudden release of huge quantity of volcanic CO2 in the End-Permian extinction. ) To prevent future catastrophic events, degassing pipes with water pumps were installed in Lake Nyos to allow the CO2 to be released to the surface instead of allowing the CO2 to be accumulated at the bottom of the lake. Since the CO2 is released gradually day after day, year after year. The concentration of the released CO2 is not high enough to cause harm to the people and is low enough for the plants in the valley to absorb over a long period of time. The degassing works to keep people safe instead of having to worry about the accumulated volcanic CO2 like a ticking time bomb. The global warming scammers trying to ban the use of fossil fuels today under the scare mongering fear of CO2 released into the air would cause catastrophic global warming is like some fools pretending to be smart by forbidding the release of any CO2 from Lake Nyos.

They then jumped rapidly to 4,500 ppm and guess what! Temperatures dove to an estimated average similar to today, even though the CO2 level was around twelve times higher than now. Yes, as CO2 went up, temperatures plummeted. About 438 million years ago, atmospheric CO2 dropped from 4,500 ppm to 3,000 ppm, yet according to fossil records, world temperatures shot rapidly back up to an average 72 degrees.

Water can absorbing huge amount of heat energy from sunlight when it is turned into water vapor WITHOUT RISE IN TEMPERATURE. Water's ability to absorb heat is more than two thousand times that of CO2. Water vapor can absorb almost 5 times the heat absorbed by CO2 for the same rise in temperature.

At night time, while the sand deserts would become cool or cold, places with large open water and moist air would be warm when some of the heat energy absorbed by water and water vapor is released to the ground, the air and to space.

The thing is that what you might perceive as gradual (im judging you here) is not gradual at all, is only gradual for your span of life. Which is subjective to say the least. But the world was one degree lower before industrial revolution and that is artificial shift for sure. The sun dont make those abrupt changes all of a sudden, all the ice age or global warmings on the past take around hundred thousand years (sometimes more, sometimes less) to occur. The current tendency speaks of only decades or maybe a hundred years to rise another one degree, how is that natural or gradual to you? And why do you dismiss the greenhouse gases protagonism at all? You can create a greenhouse in your backyard and see the effects yourself. We can also calculate the tones of emmissions of those gases into the atmosphere and correlate the information we got. Also its observable in the solar system, we can easily disregard the sun as just one variable. Venus is hotter than mercury being more closer to us than anyother planet, but having a thick atmosphere make it have almost 400¬∫ C instead of the 25¬∫C it should have by its position on the goldilock zone.

Also the ‚Äúlittle ice age‚Äù want an ice age. It was regional cooling in Europe. The global average didn‚Äôt change much. And those aren‚Äôt trends you saw. We know the glacial-interglacial cycles. Those are caused by Milankovitch cycles which depending on sunlight can effect the amount of CO2 in the air which warms/cools the earth. https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/ However this can‚Äôt explain he current warming.

Now we are in the phase of cooling, which is seen with the little ice age, but we emit C02, greenhouse Gases, harm the nature, destroy forests and oceans, etc etc and we are warming up way too fast unlike before, and if it is true that after warming up suddenly a cooling comes, then we will see a sudden more extreme ice age that would last also short as this warming period or less.

Also: Sun-induced glass on a moon far away has nothing at all to do with our situation. It's a red herring. You're taking 'yeah, climate change is gonna happen anyway' to mean 'therefore the _rate_ at which climate change is currently happening is not in part due to human activity.' Basically: You're being lied to. Nobody in the environmentalist corner is denying natural climate change cycles happen regardless. The normal climate change cycles are not the point. Sure, those would have a great impact. Again; not denying that. But with a denser atmosphere that still allows plenty of light to pass, the world is retaining _extra_ heat. More heat than it otherwise would. And the growing Sahara, which human activity contributed to greatly (albeit that activity was greatly reduced some 3000 years ago; still, the lack of trees in the region is still a fact) doesn't exactly help matters. The desert belt is allowed to grow much faster than it ordinarily would have due to human exploitation of the landscape. China and the South and Midwest of North America have been doing that much more recently, and have been doing it for thousands of years. Yes, climate change is happening regardless. But human activity greatly exacerbates it. We're not going to stop it by diminishing our resource use. But we can at least diminish the rate somewhat, and take steps (such as the reforestation siege lines now being built in sub-Saharan Africa) to further reduce the _impact_ of climate change.",UCTzgY-DUj1fZPweZqPnYSCQ,1,UgyXdujYLNyI0k17aXR4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

The earth is gonna experience rapid global cooling eventually. There's nothing we can do about it (it's a result of the earth's orbit changing periodically...due to Jupiter tugging at Earth periodically) When our orbit is more circular (as it is now), the earth experiences rapid global warming. When the orbit is more elliptical, rapid glabal cooling. (This happens under certain conditions, relating to ocean currents, which in turn is determined by things like the positions of continents) Even if we pumped 10 times more CO2 into the atmosphere, it won't stop rapid global cooling when Jupiter tugs us back into an elliptical orbit.

Everything else in politics is a smokescreen. I disagree with your assertion that everyone has to be paid equally under communism and historical implementations also prove you wrong. Under Soviet socialism the more highly skilled (requiring higher education) or more dangerous labor was compensated better than average menial work, and excellence in the technical fields like math, engineering and science was encouraged and fostered by the educational system. In China during the cultural revolution when many people were organized into autonomous, self-managed collective communes, they set their own wages according to a democratic system of points awarded based on quality of work, difficulty, work hours, etc. they were not all paid equally but ownership was communal and management democratic and had a lot of worker participation, they would debate issues in local worker councils and express their opinions on the best course of action. This is what communism means, it's about collective ownership and workplace democracy. Private ownership automatically results in exploitation by those with means of production of those without. A market economy even when regulated will still be unstable and periodically crash, it will always lead to wealth accumulation and thereby accumulation of political power by a few elites, thus undermining democracy. Capitalism is inherently anti-democratic, companies are run in an undemocratic way and this seeps into the rest of a capitalist society.",UCpUz97TXmjDzbVWu9sTBViA,1,UgyXdujYLNyI0k17aXR4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Value is not an inherent or easily quantifiable trait. There is, indeed, no such thing as a 'pure capitalist market.' Not in a system where value is given quantifiable representation (money). However, 'capitalism' is not the same as 'pure free market.' As I have argued before. Capitalism can be maintained in a controlled market, and still be capitalist... And it can be overruled in an exploitative market, where value is lost to hoarders faster than it can be created. Please understand that I am using the term 'capitalist' completely devoid of any political biases. I find that politics muddies the water and makes it impossible to fairly discuss these topics; we get so bogged down in tribalist competition that we forget about solving the issues at hand. Communism offers an alternative to capitalism, but communism in its purest form can only maintain an equilibrium of value at best, and a loss of value at worst. After all, if a labourer gets the same average for their effort as everybody else, even when they work harder, then to the labourer, value is lost and can only be regained by working less hard. (The same problem exists with wages that lie below the minimum living wage, which is a prominent feature of the USA's economic system). Socialism, however, offers not so much alternatives to capitalism as safeguards against exploitation and corruption of capitalism. In order to keep the market free, it has to be controlled against the actions of bad players. There's many methods that can be employed, from imposed parameters to active government market undercutting (an example of which is Public Healthcare; the private sector isn't banned from participation, but everyone is ensured coverage at reasonable prices set by the competition of an undercutting Third Party agent, which is the government. Another example is China, whose government buys up farmed produce so that megacorporations cannot control, and thereby reduce, the agricultural options). 'Capitalism' is not a dirty word. It's just used the wrong way, used as an excuse by the NeoNobility to get away with what is essentially malpractice that hurts the economy.",UCTzgY-DUj1fZPweZqPnYSCQ,1,UgyXdujYLNyI0k17aXR4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

The simplistic, idealized model of capitalism you described doesn't exist, has never existed and never can. There's no such thing as an ideal free market or ""pure capitalism"", economic power is always combined with political power. Capitalism is the mode of production based on private ownership of the means of production. In practice this means capital being used to generate more capital, surplus value being extracted from exploited labor and market speculation. What you described happening currently is correct but it's the inevitable and only logical conclusion of the capitalist market system. It can be no other way. Wealth accumulation from the bottom to the top inevitably creates a ruling class of privileged elites who control the state apparatus and maintain through violence or threat of violence their wealth, power and private property.

The idea that capitalism requires infinite growth isn't entire true. Rather, more truth would lie, if you ask me, in the assumption that the kind of world economy we are currently enjoying is not, strictly speaking, capitalist. Capitalism occurs when two parties trade objects, and both parties consider themselves to have gained more worth than they lost. For example: A hunter trades a deer for an axe at the flinter. The flinter, who has worked to create the axe, values a deer more than the hunter, who is in need of a new axe. In this transaction, _worth_ is created in excess by the experience of value of both participants. This is the sense in which capitalism has a theoretically infinite ability to generate wealth through worth, through essentially people's _perception_ of the value of products. What is happening currently, however, is an upper class who siphons that value out of the overall economy. An example here is investment and shares. Shares were initially created so that entrepreneurs could create businesses that were too large for the entrepreneurs to afford. They did this by selling shares of the future profit to people; people would buy those shares, and in return would (eventually) get profit, while the entrepreneur would now have a vast sum of money to invest. The problem is that those who held those shares would then sell those shares to other people; the stock market. Every time a share is sold for a profit, a bit of that share's value disappears in the profit that is made. When the top % of the population makes its money by doing so (or employing people who do so on their behalf), then that lost value disappears into their bank accounts, where it effectively doesn't exist. It does not circulate back into the economy. That is why this system requires infinite value; because value is depleted infinitely (over time), rather than created. I think that itself makes a very good case that this system that is our downfall is _not_ Capitalism.",UCTzgY-DUj1fZPweZqPnYSCQ,1,UgyXdujYLNyI0k17aXR4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

It's not only at fault for causing this disaster in the first place, putting profits over the warnings of scientists, but it's the reason why we can neither stop nor reverse climate change until we radically change the economic system. As long as we continue to practice capitalism there will never be a concerted effort to solve this crisis, because capitalism requires constant growth, it requires immediate profits, it is simply unsustainable, and it could never organize nor muster the political or economic will to sink money and effort into a project of a global scale that will deliver no financial gain. Capitalism simply cannot operate in a way that does not kill the environment. Capitalism is a system that is driven by the pathological need for profit at any cost, market economies are anarchistic and irrational and cannot help people, only enrich a few at the benfit of the many.

(With a siege creep, I am referring to planting trees at the edges of large deserts, and slowly but surely creeping farther into desert areas with plant growth).

Unlike the cult of climate, the data here will, for all the wrong reasons, provide some degree of accuracy in predicting future climate. For those with the guts to face the truth, mankind was never the driver of climate. The climate already had a reputation for change long before man and like all anthropocentric thinking, man has over assumed itself as the only source of change. In fact, it was changing long before us, and if you follow the changes, you will find no deviation from historic trend has occurred (something that surprisingly, a few people have trouble swallowing). There is a yet bigger picture of cause and effect in and around Earth&#39;s environment, the details of which comprise the next major scientific era. But in short, the poles generate cold. The equator generates heat. Warm and cold eras are built on which one gets to transport it&#39;s temp over most of earth&#39;s surface. So in the depth of an ice age, the equator will be cooler, in a hot house Earth, the poles warmer. There is no greenhouse effect because there is no trapping of the heat like in a greenhouse. The entire &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; is built on a very low IQ. Right now, a cold era is dominating in total contradiction to global warming theory. That is why, in the US, we just had the coldest spring ever in US history. A lot of rain is occurring because warm air is being hit with cold that knocks the moisture right out of the air,... just like how every cold era starts. As is expected of a sleeping scientific community more concerned with money and existential affairs, the scientific community will shake it&#39;s voodoo dolls at the sky and tell us the cold is wild and out of control, a human caused threat. Never mind that the cold will entirely abate by 2045 back into a warm era where a new pseudo science will claim it is all our fault yet again.",UCyWXae-CVK5UOBqyk64piLw,0,Ugwpjtwb0uqFQVRFss54AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Ice ages are caused by the planets rotation around the sun and the tilt of the earths axis over a 48,000+ year time frame. It is why there was an ice age 12,000 years ago that had just lasted 12,000 years long. There will be another Ice age form over the next 12,000 years. Then, 12,000 years from now. Ice a mile high will be covering Mich, NY, and NJ, in June. This will last for about 12,000 years when it will start to go back to today&#39;s temps over the next 12,000 years. THIS IS WHAT MAKES ICE AGES! We are trying to keep up with this 2 oct-trillion ton of burning plasma called THE SUN. Which is shooting threw space at an ave speed of 515,00 MPH. After a while the orbit of earth stretches and we spend most of the year farther away from then sun. Then the sun&#39;s OVER WHELMING gravity drags us slowly over 12,000 years back into a more circular orbit like we are today. This process takes about 48,000 years to complete and the earth&#39;s axis is changed 4 times during this time frame from a southern tip, like we are in now, to a northern tip. This tipping is caused by the entropy of the earths electromagnetic shield. This is what caused the last ice age to make ice to be a mile deep in NY 12,000+ years ago. The northern hemisphere was tilted away from the sun for 12,000 years. And our orbit was just ending a more elliptical pattern around the sun. We are again now into 1,000 years of the earth going in a more elliptical orbit away from the sun. The temps should be going down but they are not. We should have continued the mini ice age. But the warming of 6 billion people has stop the earth from freezing are pants off. This may be an issue in the next 100 to 200 years... But, and listen carefully... 12,000 years from now? You are NOT going to be In NY, NJ, Or Mich, unless you are standing on an ICE sheet about a mile deep. And for most of that year? It will not be warm and the CLIMATE WILL BE CHANGING! As to the mini ice age from 1300 to 1850. That is well documented that the Sun went into what is called a GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM during this time. Less pressure means colder temps. This is why we freeze during ice ages. We have less pressure from solar mass ejections hitting us most of the year when we are farther away in our yearly rotation around the sun. Less pressure from the sun on earths water vapor air and you get FREEZING WORLD WIDE TEMPS! To be clear. It is pressure from the sun that causes climate to change. Man may have warmed the planet. But nature will cool them off no matter how much heat they produce. You are not going to out due the cold of space or the heat of the sun even if you used the whole mass of the earth. Stop with the fear mongering. It gets old. 10,000 feet above your head it is freezing right now even with the sun out full all day, why?

If humanity would set aside all of its differences and work as a single entity, then I think your ideas might work if we can act fast enough.

Once a serious enough issue presents itself all the bickering goes out the window and progress becomes rapid. We could probably build enough infrastructure to both feed and house the entire worlds population around the equatorial regions within a decade if we really set out to do it.

As saltwater around the poles get more fresh from the melting glaciers and ice sheets, the salinity will drop, which, will result in the water being able to freeze at a higher temperature (100% pure water freezes at 0 degrees celsius, obviously). Then the ice sheets will reflect alot of the sunlight back, and they will form a solid platform where snow can sit, which will reflect even more sunlight back. That will also cool down the earth even more. And as the gulf stream is weakened from the previous cooling of water from the ice being melted, the amount of warm water being able to hit the poles is reduced a lot, which also, will cool down the poles even more, to the point where sea water with higher salinity will freeze more easy because of the lower temperatures, which will create ice and do the same exact thing as I mentioned first. <br /><br /><br />So in theory, the poles will get MUCH colder for a period, and the average temperature on high latitudes of the northern and southern hemisphere will also get colder. But the equator will heat up, because the warm water around there has nowhere to go as explained in the video, which in the end will reverse most of this (For a period). <br /><br /><br />I am located in Denmark btw, and another thing about why Europe is on average much warmer than America, is because we have sea (Island) climate, instead of continental climate (like the USA has). The sea around Europe, (Which is also warmer than that of the USA at same latitudes), will cool down the land in the summer, but heat it up in the winter. Oh yeah and the main mountain ranges here in Europe are also mostly running from west to east (Alps, pyrenees, dinarian alps, scottish highlands, and some parts of the scandinavian mountains), which will block the amount of cold air being transferred from the poles, to mainland Europe because of pressure systems building up on the north side of the mountains. That also explains why we usually get the coldest cold fronts from the east (Siberia/ Russia), and not from the Scandinavian peninsula (We also get cold fronts from there, or Denmark does atleast). Oh yeah and the average altitude in continental north Europe (North of the alps, south of the Scaninavian Peninsula) here is also a bit lower than the US.<br /><br /><br />I am not a scientist. I have just been thinking a lot of this, and been using common knowledge and sense. <br /><br /><br />Forgot to mention a thing. It would be really nice if tou could please leave a like. I spent a lot of time on this comment, and it would be kinda sad to see it getting lost in the comments. Oh another thing.

That‚Äôs basic physics everyone should learn in Highschool if not sooner. You appear to be predicting that we‚Äôre in large danger of turning Earth into a second Venus (or to at least produce a climate never seen before when actual reports are that we‚Äôre producing a climate not seen for millions of years, not never), and well, I have seen no credible source indicating either of those except yours, and forgive me, but your credentials of random YouTube commenter don‚Äôt exactly lead me to believe you over the majority of Climate Scientists. Also I did the math, assuming that the Sun has radiated about 5 billion kg of mass per second for the last billion years, that any mass headed our way was able to make the entire journey, and that the magnetosphere hasn‚Äôt blocked any of the heavier elements that reached us, and that a whopping .1% of all solar wind is carbon and oxygen in the right amounts to produce carbon dioxide (2 oxygen atoms for every carbon atom as apparently we‚Äôre specifying stupidly obvious stuff), then we‚Äôre talking about 600 metric tons over the course of a billion years. Let‚Äôs say that I seriously lowballed it and round it to 10,000 metric tons. That sounds like a lot, until you realize that the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere weighs about 3 trillion metric tons. Now I am just a random YouTube commentator so it‚Äôs certainly possible I did my calculations wrong especially as they were fairly back of hand stuff. And if you got even an article or something that backs up the idea that we‚Äôre gaining enough carbon and oxygen to make any real dent over any scales other than the largest of geological then that‚Äôll be interesting, but so far it doesn‚Äôt seem we‚Äôll be hitting even 1000 ppm CO2 concentrations, when Earth has had a whopping 4400 ppm CO2 concentrations during the Cambrian era. That‚Äôs not to say it isn‚Äôt a problem, but Earth will survive, it‚Äôs a big uncaring rock orbiting an uncaring sun, that will kill us all if we let it in a measly 900 million years, in a vast uncaring universe that does not care because it isn‚Äôt intelligent or even alive. The Earth will stay that same orbiting rock, until the Sun engulfs it or goes SuperNova. The life on it unless we blow up the surface with nukes, will still be going until photosynthesis fails in 900 million years when temperatures are expected to rise to such a degree (from the sun‚Äôs expansion and increased luminosity as it ages, not humans at that point), and we‚Äôre talking 50 to several hundred of degrees warmer, with current projections of what humans are likely to cause generally maxing out at 4 degrees celsius under almost unrealistically bad worst case scenarios (we‚Äôre currently looking at more likely 2 degrees). Until you have anybody to corroborate your claims, good day.

There have been a few periods in which the world could have been ice free for a few thousand years, but I have not found any indication that we know for certain. Those were periods where either global temperatures and CO2 concentrations were well above current levels, or the geography lended to a very smooth global temperature with the poles not being much colder than the tropics. Examples include parts of the Cambrian, Ordovician, Cambrian, and Cretaceous. CO2 concentrations in those times were anywhere from 800 ppm to 4400 ppm. The only one that seems reasonable for humans to reach is the lower 800 ppm. I also have yet to see any reliable source saying the glaciers will take any less than several thousand years to melt even if it gets warm enough all of them will (which I also haven‚Äôt seen, rather that they‚Äôll be greatly reduced and reach an equilibrium with much less area covered under worst cases). I‚Äôm not certain why you bring up solar wind as oxygen and carbon are trace elements in them, the amount of solar wind itself is fairly minuscule itself on the timelines we talk about when talking about Global Warming and what we can do about it, and it‚Äôs pretty reduced by our magnetic field, so feel free to illustrate why you brought it up. The increased tectonic activity is new that I hadn‚Äôt heard of before, though the principle makes sense. Doing a quick search is bringing only a few studies, so hopefully we can research this more so we can better determine the exact effects. That said, your solution of producing no heat is unfortunately not a solution. Humans themselves produce waste heat, and killing ourselves would doom Earth to burn in about 900 million years when the planet is cooked by our aging sun. My original point, is that exact future effects of Global Warming are still not 100% certain, but they generally aren‚Äôt good, and that we need to find ways to deal with them especially as many of them we‚Äôd have to deal with anyways even without Global Warming (hurricanes have been around for much longer than we‚Äôve had to worry about Global Warming, and even if we solve Global Warming that doesn‚Äôt solve Hurricanes still occasionally coming and destroying coastal cities). Furthermore the point is that humans will adapt. That‚Äôs not necessarily a good thing. Humans will adapt to any situation, good or bad. Prevent what we can, fix what we can‚Äôt, and Mitigate the rest. Ultimately though, the reason why we‚Äôve decided Global Warming is bad, is because it harms people. The easiest solution would be to create a virus that kills off all of humanity, but in that context then Global Warming is no longer a problem, it‚Äôs just a weird tiny blip on the Earth‚Äôs paleoclimate. For anyone else who has read to this point: If you are saying that Global Warming will end humanity then I call bullshit. If you are not and think that I‚Äôm understating Global Warming, then I feel the statement Millions will die doesn‚Äôt apparently mean anything.

Less rainwater means less flooding, unless you weren't afraid of that in the first place. More rainwater means cheaper water, unless it's already free because you get too much. Warmer temperatures means shorter winters, i.e. longer growing seasons. The problem is that the biosphere prefers to have a few centuries to adapt to change and we're already straining many species, many of which we already strained past what they could adapt much faster than what we generally see in the fossil record outside of extinction events. We tend to like the biosphere for the most part and don't particularly care to find out how much of it we can remove before we have to start supporting ourselves biologically. In addition, different weather patterns means that we're going to have to change our infrastructure all over the world to deal with whatever the new climates become. You start having more droughts, that means more water storage in reservoirs. More flooding, better drainage, and perhaps the need to construct large pipes that take excess water to the places with droughts. More storms, better methods of dealing with them so you don't have a refugee crisis on the coasts every storm season. All of that is expensive, and especially for poorer nations, they're just going to have to change their lifestyle to cope while richer nations like America are going to need to deal with higher costs associated with living the way we want to where we want to. Now personally, I think that some of these solutions should be undertaken even if Global Warming weren't a thing. Honestly, it's pitiful how poorly we deal with major storms that hit cities. But yea, the story of Global Warming for the most part is, we know that temperatures on average are going to rise, and we're not seeing too many positive outcomes and plenty detrimental ones, but exact effects on places are still subject to many things we are less certain about. In a way it's like the fact that we can understand how the universe is likely to end despite the fact that predicting human society past a few decades is currently impossible as there are way too many potential technologies each of which could have major effects on society.",UCPVkTk1mNlc7UGtsTSa0chg,1,Ugwd7KqAiiL_IAlW_Il4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

The fact that it already happened without humans (Multiple times...... More times than we probably know and before extinction event's actually happened) begs the question ""is it us doing this"". My point isn't that co2 is not building up, but that there's cycles which allow for co2 to be released at a higher rate. The fact that our planet is warming because of the sun, allows for more vegetative growth and so more co2 to be released........ And that cycle goes on and on until it doesn't and all hell breaks loose. Cycles of the sun have a far bigger impact on our global climate than the use of and release of carbon by humans. You're taking that whole number and blaming it on humans when there is far more at work than just humans on our planet. Whats above us and below us counts too. You mention that the last time there was a drastic change in the amount of co2 being released was because of an eruption - but failed to mention that said eruption caused 100,000 Billion tons of co2 to be released in a short period of time(which is what in ppm??(Parts Per Million)). Obviously very deadly. Comparing what we do (with incorrect information) and that eruption is of a very impudent manner. It seems that way because it most definitely is that way. As you may have seen, the renewable energy sector has taken a hit throughout this winter and will continue to do so as the world gets colder. Deforestation isn't even happening on that big of a scale taking into consideration how big our world is and how many trees/forest's and all different kinds of plant life there is. Once upon a time (during human times) The Sahara was green. How big are Russian forest's? African? South American? American? European? How many trees and forests do they all have that are untouched. The world changes and so do facts..... Cycles on the other hand, they have proven to be continuously persistent. HOWEVER..... I do agree about plastic in our oceans and over-fishing which steps have been taken and laws put in place to minimize this, so that isn't even a part of this conversation right here. You've gone right off track. And how we deal with fossil fuels and natural gasses needs attending to, I agree. There have been unforgivable mistakes that have taken place and will continue to do so if we don't have pipelines and other means of transport for these goods. I say, we should use both energies (nonrenewable and renewable) to the best of our capabilities.

Do you want to know what happened the last time that drastic an increase occurred? There was a mass extinction event. The time before that? Another mass extinction event. In fact the only time in the history of Earth that there has been a more sudden increase in CO2 levels in Earths history was after the eruption of a mega volcano that caused the largest extinction event in the planets history, The Great Dying/Permian extinction, which wiped out 98% of all life on Earth including all advanced land based life forms. The natural cycles that you refer to saw CO2 vary between 180ppm and 300ppm. It seems we have a rather different definition of what constitutes a serious shift in the atmosphere composition. Besides all of that even if you take climate change out of the debate entirely a shift towards renewable and clean energy is the logical option. I'm sure you don't like having polluted air to breath and water to drink do you? How about sea life, I doubt you want that to get wiped out by overfishing and dumping plastic into the ocean? Or forests, do you like those? Well if you do then you should support clean energy and sustainable farming.

I wasn't talking about all Brits, but Brexiters or even more particularly those people in government who felt they could get away with half-assed negotiations. Whether you like it or not: Brexiters did make arguments based on post imperial delusions of grandeur - like ""The EU needs Britain (and access to its market) more than the other way around, so desperately the UK will be able to dictate terms and get all the benefits of EU membership with none of the resposibilities"" or ""once the UK leaves the Britain will be able to negotiate trade deals with the entire world - as though the entire world just waited for that and would make getting a trade agreement with 65 million consumer Britain their top priority..."" And enough people bought into that crap to give ""leave"" a majority. Though, granted; It's possible there were people who voted leave just to give Cameron the finger, not because they actually wanted to leave the EU. We both know how close the referndum was and that almost half the population didn't buy into into the nationalistic ""better off alone"" rhetoric - at least not enough to actually vote ""leave"". I thought that was so obvious it didn't need mentioning. The point I was trying to make is a very different one: The people in Britain should be aware how badly the government bungled the process and not let them evade the consequences because ""leaving the EU is hard"". Even with the hardest task there's a difference between failing honourably after giving your best and failing miserably by neglecting even the most basic aspects.",UCDQEALJIlDemLU5r6pGuLXw,1,UgxCpltHwmbWZOzv30x4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

That said, the old 'Britain is being nostalgic about its empire' line is one I have heard from non-British Europeans _over and over_ again. I get it, for most of the world the image of Britain as a (now-ex) imperial power was the single defining trait of the country for centuries - how could a major IR decision be unrelated to it? But, surprise surprise, political discourse has kinda moved on and the average person the street never felt close to Empire anyway. It's crude cultural essentialism. But hey, the Germans are still Nazis, the Scandinavians are still Vikings and the French have another Revolution right around the corner, right?",UC2irH5qC_klr4yzEZBZy25A,1,UgxCpltHwmbWZOzv30x4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

It was madness to go into the negotions with no idea what the country wants to get out of the separation agreement. Decisions like soft brexit or hard brexit or how to deal with Northern Ireland, should have been made before the negotiations started. But since these issues were not settlend within the UK, they couldn't possibly be settled in the separation agreement. And when Theresa May finally defined a position (the Chequers-Plan) - one and a half years late - she lost about half her cabinet. It's as though someone went to a car-dealership to negotiate a lease with no clues whether he (or she) wants to lease a car, a lorry or a tractor. Had the UK government done this properly and defined its goal before it started the process, the UK wouldn't be in that ""quagmire of indecision"" now. When the negotiations started, Michel Barnier complained publically how poorly the british delegation was prepared, how little interest his the counterpart David Davis seemed to take (the man couldn't even be bothered to be present the entire time) and that the delegations leaders didn't seem to understand the consequences of their positions. Davis is a brexit hardliner and in retrospect it seems he wasn't negotiating in good faith but deliberately sabotaging the negotations to make sure there wouldn't be a successful separation agreement, thus guarantueeing a diamond hard brexit. Having someone oversee the negotiations of the separation agreement who wants to cut all ties and doesn't understand why a separation agreement is needed in the first place was a royally stupid move. Neither of those issues have anything to do with how complex the matter is. They have to do with infighting due to poor leadership and the failure to make decisions when they needed to be made. The EU has gone out of its way to protect the British people from the idiocy of their leaders. I'm not sure about Spain. But the Netherlands were a founding member of the predecessor organizations of the EU. They have plenty of experience with multilateral negotiations and coming to a consensus within their own country. The fact that Netherlands didn't have a global empire from which draw delusions of grandeur that led lots of Brits to believe the EU would be a pushover and the UK everything they want. So I'm pretty sure, if they had decided to leave the EU they would have known that there was plenty to discuss and decide before article 50 is triggered. The issue there is: British political culture is based on competition and a ""winner takes it all"" approach which is fundamentally incompatible with the more consensus-oriented politcal culture on the continent. British politicians are not used to compromise; most of them see compromise as a sign of weakness and failure.",UCDQEALJIlDemLU5r6pGuLXw,1,UgxCpltHwmbWZOzv30x4AaABAg,yyAuWeoTm2s,2019-06-03 12:00:16

Especially when it comes to the Northern Irish border. The current quagmire of indecision was a 100% inevitable after the vote decision.

It gets confined by the South American continental shelf and then the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and then flows north. It starts with the equatorial trade winds (blowing east to west) and the rotation of the Earth. The return system starts under the sea ice in the Arctic ocean where it sinks and stays in each Arctic ocean basin for 400 years or so. Then it finally flows over the choke points out in the north Atlantic (at the very bottom bottom because it is the most dense water there is on the planet) and it flows all the way to the south Atlantic where it runs into the Antarctic bottom water and slowly surfaces somewhere in the south Atlantic. So stop the winds, stp the rotation of the Earth, stop the 180 days of darkness in the Arctic, tilt the Earth differently and you can stop the AMOC.
