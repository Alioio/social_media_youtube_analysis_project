Our geological period is the Quaternary, and is characterized by massive glaciation.  Vast ice sheets stretching from the Arctic all the way down to the Missouri River, through Siberia, much of Europe, and spreading out from all major mountain ranges.


Right now, we're in a brief interglacial phase, a relatively summery stretch in which the glaciers have retreated.  These interglacial periods are short lived.  The Quaternary Ice Age has lasted 2.5 million years so far.  It's 10,000 to 15,000-year warm patches are separated by glacial periods that last several times as long as.  The current respite is called the Holocene era, and it began around 11,000 years ago. 

So in short, that respite of 10,000 to 15,000 years... we're now beyond it's minimum and in that window where the warm patch could end!

Don't tell them about the Viking colony of Greenland, (the CLUE is in the name) that Viking cattle grazed, a colony that sent delegates to the Vatican. A colony that was wiped out when the climate cooled. The Polar Bears got their ice back, but the cattle and farmers died. 
Don't tell them to read the diaries of Pepys or Woodforde, when they might see how variable the climate was then, and how you can trace the plagues and great fires to years that were remarkable for the length and intensity of the summers.

I have been doing intensive daily observations of jet traffic for over fifteen years, having made thousands of sightings and taken hundreds of photos. I have done hundreds of hours of study about jet engines, their fuel and its post combustion by-products, and I study a lot of other subjects also.
I live in a forest, have an off grid home, and I drive Suzuki Jimney, as I need a four wheel drive vehicle. I burn fire wood from weed trees taken from around my home and outbuildings.

Where I live in the antipodes, we have just lost 5,000,000 acres to uncontrolled forest and scrub fires. I have watched my beautiful little river dry up due to over logging, clearing for cattle, deliberately lit fires, and especially lack of any real forest management. The carrying capacity of my river is around one one-hundredth of the original capacity just over one hundred years ago. Some holes have thirty feet of debris in them, and this has happened in the past fifty years. Once boats came twenty miles upriver from the sea, and now it is difficult to get a canoe down the same stretch. 
I am under one of the busiest air corridors in the southern hemisphere, and the air is sometimes green with aluminium nano-particulates from ordinary Jet A fuel combustion. I watch as the continuous lines of contrails descend and expand in diameter, as they condense virtually all of the atmospheric water vapour and drag it to lower altitudes. The UV radiation is so intense that plants are scorched, something only seen in the last few years. 
The bulk of the insect life, amphibian life and bird life has markedly diminished in the last ten years, and my plants have radiological damage. So, Mr. fake name, tell me that I am mistaken again. All of what I have described is directly connected to human activity solely. In my opinion, it is criminally negligent to deny anthropogenic climate change, even a monkey can see it. Apparently the moronic comments on this page have come about by deliberate obfuscation of the evidence, and you lot of ignoramuses have swallowed it hook, line and sinker. 
Undoubtedly the deep state swamp-elements have a climate change agenda, but they use much truth in order to disguise a big lie. They want climate change to get so bad that they can seize power and mark us like cattle with an RFID implant, and the ONLY way to avoid this looming catastrophe is to take care of the planet ourselves. We need to form green corps units to manage the forest fuel and convert it to humus, and we need to restore and rehabilitate the catchments of most of this beleaguered planet.

Can't fix stupid though...All those anecdotal anomalies you mentioned have been happening for millennia before the industrial age and human population explosion.  Global warming ""scientists"" got caught cooking the books (climate gate) and changed their trope to climate change.  The sea levels haven't risen, the earth has cooled since their prognosis of warming doom, the earth didn't end.  If TPTB were interested in reducing carbon emissions they'd time the lights in every city, since there's a traffic light engineering department in every municipality with traffic lights ALREADY BEING PAID FOR.  At 8 lbs of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline burned, cutting gas consumption in half would do some actual good, if it actually caused warming.  Remember, these same greedy, lazy, inept politicians swim in the same soup we call an atmosphere.  Climate change is a fear mongering boogeyman tactic for the purpose of concentrating more power/control and coercing more theft via carbon taxation.  They're going to tax the fucking air, buddy.

Problems affect society and the planet, if we have a big problem with the environment, it is our economic model, if we have a problem with our social it is because of our economic model.

But no, instead of being a doomsayer- like this speaker- one must look at future-casting the possibilities of what is the next step, the next discovery for mankind, the next massive achievement  of the near-limitless human mind & spirit.

In addition to the enormous warehouse for food storage, they have a 40 acre farm on site for vegetables, fruit, and dairy where I've volunteered. They also provided meals to students in the after-school program I worked for at another nonprofit and created a food pantry on my college campus. Basically, if you live in or around San Antonio you'll see how much impact this one organization has over a city of 1.5 million people PLUS the surrounding areas. So why is it troubling to see so many cars and know there's still not enough food to go around? Well, other orgs from around the country sent their staff to SA Foodbank to learn from their procedures but if our food bank is one of the best in the country and still doesn't have enough food to go around (especially when there are smaller orgs helping out too) then we have a real problem. We're seeing tens of thousands of people depend on SA Foodbank alone but if they can't even provide food to everyone then it speaks volumes about our society and the lack of government and corporate efforts to end hunger. TLDR; If we rely solely on nonprofits to fix hunger then we're never going to have enough for every family that needs it.

It is a heat engine driven by fossil carbon, and there is no alternative with a similar EROEI and robustness, so we have never developed any real alternatives to the Diesel engine for rural areas, for tractors, for trucks, for generators.
Without fossil fuels---and we will eventually run out if we don't stop using them--we don't know how to produce and distribute food on an industrial scale. We may need other types of heat engines that can run on a wide variety of fuels, not necessarily internal combustion engines but maybe also external ones, like steam turbines or Stirling engines. 
The future will be rough, we will need technology which is robust and versatile, and which is as modular as possible so that it can easily be taken apart and reassembled into something different. We will need farm machines that can run on anything, and which every small village can produce on its own in a tiny factory.

The reason food rots on the field isn't because there's no infrastructure.  Its because nobody bought them.  A trucker isn't going to buy potatoes off a farmer to then give them away to a food bank.  Nor is a farmer going to donate his crop when doing so could cost them their farm.  Talking new tech ignores the fact that in times of crisis government should be organizing purchase and transport of food, and they didn't.  They didn't even think of it.  And that's the problem.
The only solution to food security in a post climate change world is to decentralize it.  Every home should be designed with food production in mind. It won't completely solve distribution but it provides individual households a buffer, so that distribution from larger farms can catch up.  It also reduces the amount of land needed to feed everyone significantly since a sizable portion of production is moved into urban and suburban landscapes.  Allowing nature and reforestation efforts to take over. At the end of the day climate change can't be solved with capitalism or innovation.

1) Here is a problem, X. (In this case, lots of produce in one place and lots of starving people in another place.)

2) I have absolutely no education or expertise in this topic. However, I come from a wealthy family and went to an Ivy League university, so I was able to get other people to pay for me to take a FIVE YEAR VACATION, where I talk to people who are solving an entirely different problem that happens to be peripherally related. 

3) All of the proposed solutions require capital, so they can only be implemented by capitalists.

4) Denigrate solutions that do not require capitalists. 

5) Utterly ignore the fact that simply improving the supply does not solve the problem of getting said supply to the people who are demanding it.

6) Invent a new term to describe what other people are already doing so you can pretend that you had some part in inventing the solution.


The problem is almost never been that we could not make enough food. The problem has almost always been that capitalists continuously find more and more ways to make accessing that food more expensive so that the capitalists continue to wring more and more blood out of those turnips. 

The solution is:
A) Tuning our production to match an appropriate nutritious diet. Instead of producing tons of potatoes because they are a high profit item for fast food restaurants.

B) Distributing production so it is physically closer to the demand.

C) Putting that production in the hands of the people instead of capitalists.

By developing CRISPR and all sorts of technology from capitalist societies..  crops can be protected from oscillation in weather conditions (especially East Africa) and intruders...such as locusts.

Our plants need carbon to grow and can't without so soil turns to dirt amd that carbon creates globbing warming when its in our atmosphere.

The framing here is screwy.  She is right about GMOs, they are the way to solve a lot of problems, but there is a huge portion of the audience she is literally talking to that is anti-GMO.  These are your wealthy audience who will gladly pay 6-8 times more for ""organic"" products that use farming methods that produce too little to be nationally sustainable.  These are also the people who will pay 3 times more for a burger patty made out of plants, grown with bad farming practices and loaded with things the make them approximate the real thing, that are by every metric worse for you then the burger made out of beef.  Part of the farming revolution has always been the ability to make more out of less.  Less land, land fertilizer, less work, etc.  It's better to have real animals on the land, consuming the inedible parts of it, excreting nutrients the land needs, and then that animal can feed a person. This also has the ability to sequester huge amounts of carbon.  She also basically invoked the healthy user bias when it comes to those lab meats, but they are not market ready.  I know this because I can't buy them anywhere.  And if a piece of lab grown chicken is going to be more expensive than using real chicken, you have a real problem.  Innovation is interesting.

They won't stand for targeted weed or crop spraying- they'd rather farmers continue wasting tons of their chemicals and fertilizers - potable water supplies be damned. (Lake Eerie toxic algal blooms from agricultural runoff has had Toledo and surrounding areas curtailing potable water supply and usage a few years ago already).

And yet midwest corn yields are up, prices are down, and the specter of repeated formidable toxic algal blooms remains a constant threat to drinking water for the 54M people served by the Great Lakes watershed.

Farm bill policy has for decades been incentivizing farmers in the heartland to pump the Ogallala Aquifer dry. Kansas City has already encountered zero day (when wells run dry) and more cities will soon experience this. 

This is bigger than food. It's the availability of potable water that's being threatened which needs our attention firstly. The food concerns can be dealt with after we secure and protect our potable water supplies.  That's going to take more than just science.

From a hot ball of fire to ice age to the optimal temperature that we know today is due to change in climate which took billions of years. But thanks to humans, climate change has been faster than ever. Earth has heated by 0.8¬∞C from the start of this century. Every decade has been warmer than the previous. According to IPCC, 1.5¬∞C average rise might put 20-30% species at risk of extinction. 2¬∞C average rise will harm almost everyone. *Average rise* means winter will be colder and summer will be hotter. The first kind of species to be affected by this change are warm blooded animals like Aves and Mammals. 750Billion tons of ice melts every year with the amount increasing every year. Thats 24,000 tons of water every freaking second, thats like the size of 10 olympic pools every darn second. Due to which the sea level has risen by 8cm in just 20years and at this pace it might rise by a meter by the end of 21st century. This is utmostfear for any island nations. 8 islands got submerged in 2017 alone, 3 in 2018. Countries like Tuvalu, Marshalls island, Maldives, Kiribati are at greatest risk. Maldives even held an underwater conference to highlight this issue. With increasing water level, the amount of CO2 trapped in ocean also increases thus increasing the acidity of water and making habitat of pisces much harsh. The increasing water level (as well as climate change especially from deserted area and area of high rainfalls) also contributes to immigration/refugees. The estimated number of climate change refugees is 250million by 2050. Rapid climate change has also contributed to harsh weathers/weather extremes and natural calamities. Recents examples include Amazon fire (altough was mostly highlighted due to political tensions between Brazil and USA), Australian bush fire 19/20, which occurs every year but this time it was the harshest and resulted in death of wildlife  more than any of the previous years, thanks to climate change aswell, Atlantic hurricane, Vietnam floods, etc.  The climate related disasters in the decade 2000-2010 was only 59 which jumped to 111 between 2010-2019 (2020 is still ongoing).

  We need to give people a reason to not reproduce so much. There's just not enough resources to support so many people for very long. But who doesn't want to have children when see how difficult things are as we grow old? Especially when things happen like threatening our social security system, instead of making it better. Not to mention how horrible our national healthcare system is. That and constantly rising costs of a home, food, utilities. Not to mention that people deserve to live their retirement in some comfort.
  Give people a good life and they naturally gravitate towards doing things they love. Like taking better care of the children already all around them. Inventing ways of living cleaner and healthier, and leading more fulfilling lives, instead of living in constant fear. All of these things lead people to *choose* to have less children, or even none. Because it's what they want, not because they are in fear of survival witch absolutely necessitates procreation. 
  This would help children as well because there are so many good people in the world that would love to be teachers if they were paid and treated well by society. If we directed our focus away from war and towards education and health instead of the chance for a very few to become incredibly wealthy, leaving most people struggling, literally everyone would be better off except for one very small group of people: the wealthy elite. They know this too and that's why they do everything they can to keep us fighting each other.
  It would be a great change yes, but if we all just decided to work as a team, we can do all that and much more. We just need to see past those who want to stop others from having freedom too.

Does this issue need to be new to acknowledge it? This issue is far more alarming than global warming! It's because of active sentient beings who produce wasteful materials, commit dangerous acts through policies constructed behind closed doors that we face global warming now; which is also an old problem. 

It's these people who misinform by poor education systems for the youth growing into adults with immature brains, and disinformation by political and media means by which the uneducated become ill informed. Thus does the masses become a cancer to the very easy of life they can't live without and had very little to do with in the decisions for us construction. 

We did build this nation or world. We were given options on a shelf, a commercialed tv slot, and salesmen who knows no more than we do about what it is he sales to us.

Assuming that the climate is not affected by an increase in CO2 emissions, there are still many consequences that could destroy the planet and us if we continue with our unsustainable amount of fossil fuel emissions:
An increase in CO2 in our atmosphere will result in the acidification of the world's bodies of water.
As we all know, water (H2O) makes up our lakes, rivers and oceans. We also naturally have some CO2 in our atmosphere. When they come into contact, they create carbonic acid, a weak acid:

H2O(l) + CO2(g) ---> H2CO3(aq)

Now normally this isnt a big deal, since the skeletons from dead fish in our bodies of water, when they decompose, emit carbonate( due to a reaction with the carbonic acid), a weak base. And since bases and acids cancel each other out, we return back to relatively pure, maybe slightly acidic (6.9 ish PH). Well what happens when we keep throwing CO2 into our atmosphere into our bodies of water? More aquatic life dies, more carbonate is formed to balance out the carbonic acid. Eventually we reach a threshold were there is no longer enough carbonate produced from the remains of fish to stabilise the PH of the water. Then the PH of the water continues to turn ever so acidic. But wait, there's more! Because water exists in many states of matter, we know that acidic water will eventually make its way into the clouds by means of evaporation. And when it rains... Boom! Acidic rain!
Now, a lesson in Biology:

All living things that exist in their habitats survived by living in a carefully balanced ecosystem. Plants use water the action of absorbing water to also sustain itself by pulling in nutrients to produce fruit, which are then consumed by herbivores, who are then consumed by carnivores, who then die and have their remains eaten by the tertiary consumers. Well, what happens if plants start to die off, or yield far less fruit because the water they absorb is the equivalent of a toxin for them and is destroying their cells? That problem is then passed on to the herbivore, who eats less, which is then passed on to the carnivore who eats more at first, then runs into problems, when the herbivore population plummets, etc. Now, onto us, humans. 

The human body has many means of maintaining homeostasis (maintaining adequate internal stability) the skin protects us from most bacteria among other things, our cells themselves have barriers that prevent certain things from entering and leaving, our blood has a relatively neutral PH of 7 to ensure that everything works properly. Now, imagine we started to drink slightly acidic water. Everything in our body would fall apart, cells would die, our DNA would break apart slowly, causing genetic problems, organs -one by one would fail. If you don't believe me just search up all my claims to fact check them.

This is just some of the ways that increased CO2 is killing us and the planet.",UCwGuwFO3azV47wfLFFrnUSg,1.0,UgyPcrk8GbnXB_OnoVh4AaABAg,7ErKuXByRto,2020-11-17T07:00:01Z,climate crisis

Go ahead and believe in whatever invisible stuff you want to, Jack, but the time to believe in something is when you have evidence FOR it, not simply because there's a lack of evidence against it.

What melted the last ice age?
What froze the last ice age?
Was not CO2,  it was the sun, orbit, volcanism, or comet or asteroid.
92% of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is simple water vapor.
Chemical energy got man into the Industrial Age.  Does oil and coal pollute you bet.  It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up.  Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors.  It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron.  Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid.  More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more.  Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..",UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow,0.0,UgydIQ0yqS1rOmLGT314AaABAg,gzksqQDI_kE,2020-07-27T09:00:09Z,climate crisis

Whatever vitamins and nutrients we get from milk, if we can get it from other eatable things, then we can stop drinking cow's and buffalo's milk. As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to places. All of this can be stopped. 
For infants whose mother's have died or mother's who cannot breast feed their infants, only for them cow's and buffalo's milk should be given. We use milk in tea and coffee. Instead of milk we must use lime with tea and coffee. A lime should be cut into a few pieces and cooked with tea and coffee or something else can be used instead of lime.

10. A Manufacturing Company Which Is Not A Necessity For Human Beings, If It Is Stopped, Then We Have The Following Benefits

When a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings, if it is stopped, then we have the following benefits.
That company which is built in a place, that much land is saved, machines does not have to be manufactured, for machines to operate oil is needed and many other things, for which we have to make oil manufacturing company and all other companies for all other things like cartoon boxes, plastic ropes and plastic cans, registers, pencil, pen, stationery products. To make cartoon boxes papers are required and to stick papers gums are required. To make gums so much dough is needed and caustic soda is needed. If we don't manufacture cartoon boxes then that dough can be eaten. Transportation is needed to deliver things to all the shops. Roads have to be constructed. For transportation we need vehicles and to operate vehicles petrol is needed, to get petrol we have to set up oil rig platforms in the sea or land and to deliver petrol to a petrol pump that petrol is needed to be put in a drum, a plastic drum has to be manufactured and then many ships have to be manufactured for shipping the petrol to all the places. For all this works so much land is lost and so much pollution is created, from that pollution humans, land animals, sea animals, aerial animals and earth is suffering. Also many transportation items which requires huge trucks for transportation a driver has to drive only at night and his day life is lost. Surely at night time driving the driver would become sleepy sometimes and accidents do happen. 
All of this can be reduced and this will be our benefits if we stopped a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings. When you stop making a manufacturing company then all the problems related with it won't occur.

11. Why We Should Manufacture Less Nutrient Foods Like Horlicks And Bournvita

Bournvita, Horlicks should be given to only persons who cannot exercise and are too weak. For others who have deficiency and are not too weak, they should eat natural foods and exercise so that the foods would get absorbed well in their body and their deficiency would be alright. If still they cannot exercise and get tired easily, they could do some light exercises or yoga in their spare time which would take long to get tired. When a person has calcium deficiency, they would be prescribed calcium tablets, but instead they could be informed that if they eat foods which have calcium, their problem can be solved. If this is done, we won't have to prepare so many horlicks, bournvita and other nutrients foods like that. So then we don't have to prepare the plastic, glass or paper pack bottles and hence less pollution.

12. To Reduce Television Time

Television programs is for 24 hours a day. A human works for 8 hours a day, 1 hour for getting ready in the morning, travelling time assume for 2 hours a day, half an hour would be spent in relaxing, talking to friend's for half an hour, talking with family for half an hour, 1 hour spent in a park and sleeping time for 6 hours. Altogether 19 and half hours are spent for weekdays. So only 4 and half hours are left. In that why television is then for 24 hours. Well non working women's and students going to schools and colleges have extra free time. As television is for 24 hours now, then many students instead of spending their time in studying watch television more and study less. Non working women‚Äôs in their free time instead of watching television could do some other activities. Television should be shown in evening from 7pm to 8pm, cartoon shows should be shown for kids at that time. From 8pm to 9pm teenagers programs should be shown. From 9pm to 11pm programs should be shown for grown-up peoples. If you watch colour television for more than 2 hours, the rays coming from television affects your health and eyes.

At present due to problems going on in the world, 24 hours news channels are required. So we can keep news channels for 24 hours. Sports channels can also be shown for 24 hours. 

On Sundays television can be shown for 9 to 11am in the morning and 2 to 5pm in the afternoon and 7 to 11pm in the evening.

Also in a year so many movies are made. In a year there are 52 weeks, so only 52 movies should be produced in one country. One Sunday one movie should be watched. Their should be no production of video or CD cassettes of the picture, only uploaded in the internet, so that if anyone wants to watch any movie again, they can download and watch it again. 

Also if their are only 52 movies in a week, there would be less downloading of movies in the whole world and less time spent in the mobile or computer.

13. How Much Should Be The World's Population

How much population should the world have, that our earth can handle the pollution created by our work in which no harm comes to any living beings and the earth, it should be researched and that population has to be maintained.

For example if our earth can handle pollution of 5 billion people, then the world should have only 5 billion people only. We would have to have one child only from now on till the population reaches 5 billion. As if everybody had only one child, population will decrease. After that everyone can have 2 children's. When 2 children's are born, then population will increase. When the population reaches 5.5 billion, then everyone should have only one child till the population reaches back to 5 billion. After that everyone can have 2 children's. In this way population can be maintained. 

But if the world doesn't want to keep the population limited, then this would lead to disasters. The world should not want that to happen. 

In countries like india and china population is too much. In china people's are having 1 child only. In india the government has said to people to have 1 child only, but it is not followed. India has to agree to have one child only. Even if india agreed, still it would take a long time to reduce population for both countries. 
To reduce population fast, this method should be used. 
Couples would be 1st born, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and so on. In this when a person is marrying another person, and they are 1st and 2nd born and also their father, mother and grandparents are 1st and 2nd born, then they can have 2 children's.
If the persons marrying each other are 1st and 2nd born, but the man's father or mother or grandfather or grandmother is 3rd born, 4th and so on, and the woman's father, mother and grandparents are 1st or 2nd born, then they can have 1 children. Also if the man is 3rd born, 4th and so on and his wife is 1st or 2nd born and wife's mother, father and grandparents are also 1st and 2nd born, then they can 1 children.
If the man is 3rd born or 4th and so on and also his wife is 3rd born or 4th and so on, then they should not have any children's.
If a man and woman are 1st or 2nd born, but both their father's, mother's or grandparents are 3rd born or 4th and so on, then they should not have any children's. In this way population can be reduced fast.

14. Instead Of Television We Should have Projectors

To manufacture a television so many things are required, but if we have projectors instead, then we do not need that many things for television production.

15. Other Things Which We Can Stop Using

Exercise equipments, hair straighteners and shampoos. Only anti dandruff and hair lice shampoos are needed. Whatever vitamins and nutrients we get from shampoo for the hair, that should be found in eatable things and people should do exercises so that it gets absorbed well in the body. With regular exercise your hair would become healthy. Robots are not needed in large numbers. A few robots are needed to do some work's in companies. For jewels like gold, diamond, etc., which are manufactured in ring, necklace and other forms, just manufacture a ring as it is needed for wedding and stop other forms of manufacturing. Like this less mining would be needed of jewels and less forests would be cut down for mining. We use steel utensils, instead of that if we use mud utensils, less mining would be needed of iron ore.",UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg,0.0,UgzKdUpoPLRSwzkqBC94AaABAg,gzksqQDI_kE,2020-07-27T09:00:09Z,climate crisis

1. Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped

We manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. Well maybe we won't have a major natural disaster soon, but it will come some day. So if we minimise our products, pollution would be less.
We produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things which are not required as a necessity for humans, so much pollution could be reduced.
If we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. 

2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form

We can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. 
But if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.
So if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world. Humans have to do this before it is too late.

If this is done, then many jobs would be lost. But human jobs or planet earth, which should we save, planet earth is more important. Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the earth, making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans after 100 or 200 years.
Prior to the industrial revolution or before that humans worked everything handmade. So if after shutting down many manufacturing companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if we started doing many things handmade only then many people would not lose jobs. Many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own.
Is their any another solution, that humans won't lose jobs and also planet earth will be saved.

3. We Should Stop Using Makeup Products

Many women's all over the world do makeup. Makeup is not a necessity for humans. Instead of doing makeup to look beautiful, women's should do exercise daily. If they exercise and sweat, eat fruits daily, they would have less dead skins and be naturally beautiful. They could save so much money if they stop using makeup products. If this is done then all the makeup manufacturing companies can be shut down. In this way all the pollution resulting from the makeup manufacturing companies would also be stopped.

4. Electricity Pollution

We create electricity from many types of sources like coal, water, etc., but it creates pollution. If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs. But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would occur.
As I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not a necessity for humans, then the world would not require so much electricity. Then maybe we could provide electricity to the whole world from windmill and Solar panels which are not pollutant. If we stopped producing electricity from coal, water, etc., then the pollution resulting from them won't occur. Shouldn't we take this step to protect our earth as already our earth is suffering so much from pollution. 
At present the world is researching how to solve the pollution problem, it would take how many years I don't know and also would it possible or impossible, God knows. Could we wait till that time when scientists would find how to solve pollution problems and till that the earth won't have a major natural disaster, nobody knows.

5. Firecrackers should be banned

Firecrackers should be banned because it is harmful for animals. Animals have different levels of hearing and when we burst crackers which have a loud noise the dogs run away from that place. The dogs may hear the noise more louder than humans. When we fire the rocket cracker up in the sky and it bursts and if any bird is near to the explosion then that birds internal organs are damaged and they die just because of that explosion sound. Also peoples who have asthma illness, they face problems during Diwali. So much papers and threads are used in manufacturing crackers. The persons working in the manufacturing companies also suffer.
Now when their are animals rights for not harming them, then this step of banning firecrackers must be taken.

6. Hair dye manufacturing should be banned

People use hair dye to colour their hairs. The hair dye manufacturing companies after production dumps its waste in rivers or seas which pollutes the water. So all hair dye manufacturing companies should be shut down.

7. We Can Stop Eating Sweets, Cakes And Stop Drinking Liquor, Wine And Beer

We consume sweets and cakes. We make it from many things such as wheat, coconut, etc. and add sugar to it. But what we want is the sweet thing to consume which we are getting directly from fruits. The fruit is naturally sweet. So if we want to consume sweets and cakes, we do not have to prepare it, just we have to eat fruits. So all the sweet manufacturing companies can be shut down. If you shut down a sweet manufacturing company, then so many paper boxes need not be manufactured which are used to pack the sweets.
Liquor, wine and beer are also made from fruits. So if you want to consume liquor, wine and beer, just eat fruits. If this is followed, then you do not have to set up liquor factories and prepare cartoon boxes for liquors. Everybody should go to the rehabilitation centres those who can't live without liquor.

8. To Stop Using Perfumes And Powders Which Is Not A Necessity

For bad smell in body both men and women should exercise and sweat, it would reduce the bad smell.

""Time Has An End""
Time has an end, with much of God's word, the Bible, to comprehend, but most won't contend, and climate change won't mend; Global warming is God's final warning, as He is always in control, and He is our Weatherman (Isaiah 45, Nahum 1, Jeremiah 23....)Because of too much rebellion and sin, and wicked hearts within. (Jeremiah 7, Psalm 48, Romans 1-3...) God gave us His written word, originally in Hebrew and Greek, and called this book the Bible, to show us how to live and be; The Bible was written by holy men of old, many years ago, as God moved them through the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:21); And all scripture was written by inspiration of God, for us to be corrected, and reproved, by walking in His truth (2 Timothy 3:16,17); We have a most loving, and merciful God, to be praised and obeyed, from the moment we arise, til we go to sleep at night, yet much of the world won‚Äôt take heed, and go their own way; (Psalm 113:3, Ezekiel 39, Jeremiah 12, Ephesians 5, Titus 3, 2 Timothy 3..... ) He is the King of kings, LORD of lords, He is our Savior, Creator of all, but most won't even acknowledge Him, and mock Him with much gall; We‚Äôre in the ‚ÄúGreat Tribulation‚Äù now of Matthew 24, the LORD has opened up the seals (Revelation 5-22), so we can see truth more; In Daniel chapter 12 vs 9, God told Daniel the seals were closed til the end of time; If you study from Isaiah to the book of Malachi, hopefully you will see that this is all about the end times; Too many false gospels, signs and wonders, none have the truth, since God has allowed Satan to take his seat in the temple, and now rules, according to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 (2 Corinthians 11, Revelation 2,3, 17-22)Judgment has begun on the house of God, in 1 Peter chapter 4, God is starting with the churches, and then to many more; (Ezekiel 9, Jeremiah 25...) God is our Faith, our Baptism, our LORD, and Father of all, and only He can save, not the pope, priest, you, or me, and none can come to Him, unless He draws, and only by His mercy; (John 6:44, 10:30, Ezekiel 36, Romans 1-9, 1 Timothy 2:5, Titus 3, Ephesians 1-5...)So as the days of Noah, because of too much sin, when the floods came, and took most everyone/thing away, except for the animals on ark, and Noah's family of eight, So shall our LORD and Savior, Jesus Christ (both the same), come and destroy this earth with fire on the dreadful Judgment Day, with only a remnant saved (Isaiah 1, 10, 11, Jeremiah 23, 31, Ezekiel 6, Joel 2, Malachi 4, Romans 9, 11, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, Revelation¬† 11, 12, 18-22‚Ä¶.), and He alone is the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2);Please come soon LORD Jesus, please come soon, let Satan and sin no longer rule, for many are suffering, more and more each day, especially the children, LORD we pray; Please come soon dear LORD, please come save (Revelation 18-22)

First and foremost, most experts agree that CO2 fertilization is probably a temporary effect. The reason is simple: anything that limits growth, whether it‚Äôs sunlight, water, carbon, or even physical space, can only stimulate plants up to a point. Eventually, they run into some other resource limitation. This principle, called ‚ÄúLiebig‚Äôs law of the minimum,‚Äù was developed in agricultural science to explain why fertilizing a crop with plentiful nutrients doesn‚Äôt stimulate growth. It‚Äôs proven to be a very robust concept.
CO2 fertilization also stands to impact plant growth in unexpected ways. It‚Äôs possible, for instance, that some plants are putting out more leaves at the expense of roots, which could have detrimental effects on their long-term health.
Finally, some ecologists worry CO2 fertilization will have dramatic feedbacks on the entire climate system. For instance, plants pump a lot of water from the ground into the atmosphere; a process known as transpiration. ‚ÄúWhen plants have more leaves, they can pump more water into the atmosphere, resulting in more clouds and rainfall,‚Äù Myneni said. ‚ÄúThis could make the hydrological cycle more vigorous.‚Äù

If you read in my comment describing corrupt corporate agendas that include global warming hysteria and climate change that occurs every time the sun comes up, yes I agree there -- while the real threat is geoengineering that includes massive aerosol spraying of toxic substances into the atmosphere that accumulate in the soil as well as fill the air in areas downwind. Gigawatts of energy are pumped into the atmosphere using converging frequencies to create various effects upon weather patterns and geology to the long term detriment of the Earth, supported by corrupt agendas that do not in reality carry concern for the planet while the priority is control rather than any improvements envisioned.
Geo-engineering is the massive aerosol spraying of nano aluminum, barium compounds and toxic heavy metals into the atmosphere with the nominal intent of reflecting sunlight back out to space to combat global warming, but in fact is tied to a eugenics philosophy of severe population reduction in the name of saving the planet. Geo-engineering also includes the pumping of gigawatts of energy into the atmosphere to further fuck with the weather and create other serious and damaging effects upon people and the environment. 
A massive toxification of the planet in order to save it is the most ridiculous of all inside narratives for one to buy and is eugenics based. For 90 years now they've known that developing and progressing nations will reduce their population growth rate to approaching zero and in certain cases have now reached negative growth rates. Yet they've done everything in their power to promote toxification, a toxic solution for everything from agriculture and medicine to plastics manufacture, food packaging and toxic food additives to replace outlawed non-toxic preservatives like boric acid. This was done by managing the chemical industry, to provide toxic solutions to many other industries in a process of normalization so that we are a fanatic if we want to eat like our grandparents did in the face of skyrocketing cancer rates and other degenerative conditions. This is something that began in a big way in the 40's using the war to introduce many things like preservatives and agricultural chemicals to increase yields while the long term effect is severe on human health and the environment. Glyphosate in GMO corn, when this is fed as a 100% diet to rats causes huge tumors to form, while these independent studies are suppressed in the media. Yet there have always been many non-toxic options that could have been pursued. People have proven that organic and innovative methods can produce more food of much better quality.
To take the global warming aspect at face value is to buy the cover for the eugenics based agenda 21 related programs for the destruction of most of humanity as the alleged ""scourge"" of the planet -- but in fact, the scourge is what has been perpetrated upon humanity during many decades now -- while they keep third world nations desperate and starving with exploding populations through corrupt IMF loan sharking schemes and foreign aid that serves the power players who play ball while the money [likewise with foreign aid] rarely reaches the people who need it in any form. Third world nations at one time did not suffer from population explosion until western interests disrupted their local culture without allowing them to participate in western style culture and benefits, leaving them as a result at a subsistence level in good years and vulnerable to any change of circumstances. The excuse of trying to prevent industrialization around the world does not hold water in the face of environmental degradation from the deplorable conditions that currently exist from overpopulation -- while tax and trade incentives have worked whenever they were permitted in order to promote clean technologies, many of which have been suppressed during the past century.  
The world wars as in all wars have been managed affairs to put down progressive nations who were not willing to follow the interests of international banking and trade. . too sensitive an issue for most to touch while they keep us at one another if they can over racism long past and other methods of division and hysteria -- the only haters today being the accusers who need to create someone or something to hate.

For me, 'catastrophic' means that it threatens organised human society. If this is going to be a catastrophe if we do nothing, then that means we should be suspending our whole economy to fix this problem before its too late. 

However, if it's not going to be a catastrophe, we don't need to do that. We can carry on as normal and feel more relaxed about the pace at which we need to fix the problem. 

So, you see how it matters? 

If you're interested, there is only one pole I found that asked climate scientists about how worried they were about manmade CC. 

It went something like this:
15% Not worried at all
45% moderately worried
40% very worried (catastrophic)

Now, when you see those numbers, it becomes clear that the debate in the scientific community is not about whether manmade CC is happening... it's about how concerning it is. 

So we need to stop saying 'the debate is over, there is no debate, the science is settled, 97%....'

1. Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped

We manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. Well maybe we won't have a major natural disaster soon, but it will come some day. So if we minimise our products, pollution would be less.
We produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things which are not required as a necessity for humans, so much pollution could be reduced.
If we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. 

2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form

We can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. 
But if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.
So if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world. Humans have to do this before it is too late.

If this is done, then many jobs would be lost. But human jobs or planet earth, which should we save, planet earth is more important. Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the earth, making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans after 100 or 200 years.
Prior to the industrial revolution or before that humans worked everything handmade. So if after shutting down many manufacturing companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if we started doing many things handmade only then many people would not lose jobs. Many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own.
Is their any another solution, that humans won't lose jobs and also planet earth will be saved.",UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg,1.0,Ugxlp27DlSRFFYOcBnZ4AaABAg,gzksqQDI_kE,2020-07-27T09:00:09Z,climate crisis

You never went to school? You never saw a documentary about the subject?

Well let me give a piece of very basic information you should have known by now:

 Natural past climate changes are the basis of the anthropogenic climate change theory!

Amazing isnt it?

So when you say that the climate changed several times in the past you, in your head, think that you are giving people this very new information that they didnt have and expect a certain reaction.

 Unfortunately, we all know that, Thomas. And you don't understand that. Perhaps you never will. So tragic..

Thanks, but I'm actually not trying to convince you of anything as I haven't even come to any conclusions myself. I'm simply presenting evidence for discussing. Corby seems to think that a list of facts is something that can be debated. I never told him that the moon was a hologram, or a hollowed out mega structure, because I don't actually believe those things. The scientific process starts with asking questions in order to addresses relevant  anomalies in theory. I simply listed some facts and apparently very smart Corby felt the need to argue against reality. I'm not even sure what he's doing, but whatever he's attempting to do he's failing horribly at it. 

I'm also in the last year of an engineering program so when soemone as stupid as him says ""you're not scientifically literate"" it's just another irony fail.

The metric of measurement is not relevant to this conversation, at all. Instead of using KMs to measure the distance let's make up a unit called Lunets that are equal to 100 KMs. Instead of kilometers being used to measure the geometrically identical lengths, its now lunets that are being used as the metric of measurement. The length stays exactly the same regardless of the unit of measurement. A squares sides will always have the same relationship to each other no matter how you decide to measure them. The facts that I've stated don't change when the unit of measurement is changed. The numbers will be different but the ratios remain the same. This is grade school level stuff.

Reposted comment. 

Climate is a hoax. What you call seasons and temperature is actually a false flags. Trump is an Alien and Asia's a hologram. The earth is hollow, the moon is hollow and my brain is hollow. 

Seriously though, there's some weird stuff happening on the moon. Look up videos about the moon ringing like a bell for minutes after we shot missiles it (true story). How does solid rock ring like a bell? Look up the verified ""lunar waves"" that have been filmed on the moon. 

The moon is also older than the earth which doesn't make any sense if everything in our solar system formed at the same time. 

The moon is also 72 times larger than any other moon in  relation to the planet that its orbiting. No other moon is 1/4 of the size of it's planet like our moon is, not even close. 

Why do all of the caters on the moon have the exact same shallow depth? If it were rock than the carters would be all different depths, but they very strangely are not. 

When astronauts tried to drill into a crater they were barely even able to break the surface. They also discovered processed metals like pure titanium, that doesn't occur naturally. 

*This is even more unbelievable.*

The sun is EXACTLY 400 times bigger than the moon. And it's also 400 times the distance away. 

The earth turns 366 times as it orbits the sun. The earth is 366% the size of the moon at it's poles. The moon orbits the Earth 366 times every 10,000 days. 

There are 109.2 Earth diameters across the sun's diameter. At its farthest point, there are 109.2 diameters between the earth and the sun. The circumference of the moon is 10920 kilometers. 

The moons polar circumference is 27.3%. The earth's polar circumference is 27.3% The Earth's polar circumference ism

The moon orbits the earth every 27.3 days. What are the chances of this beautiful geometry being completely random? Someone actually calculated the number. It's, .000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%. That is a real percentage describing the likelyhood of the moon being natural that was worked out by two astrophysicists. 

There is something very strange and very unnatural about the moon. I don't know what this means but you'll almost never hear American scientists talking about it. Although there there are a lot of very prominent and respected scientists from Europe and Russia that are trying to figure out wtf is going on. Everything that I wrote is 100% true and verifiable (except for the first facetious paragraph). I'm an engineering student and scientifically literate. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or a paranoid person. The things that I wrote are real scientific anomalies.

The moon is absolutely 100% older than the earth. There have been enough scientific carbon datings of moon rocks from independent sources to confirm this. Your theory doesn't make sense based on it's presuppositions. If the inner planets formed at the same time, and the moon is the result of two proto-planets crashing into each other, it should result in the two bodies having the same amount of carbon 14 when they're radio dated because they're formed from the same composition of molecules. Neighbor planets use the same accretion disks to solidify into planets. Therefore they're formed out of the same rocks and because of this they're the same age. If the moon formed the way that you say that it did than its age and composition would be closer to that of earth. Geologiscal processes do not explain these anomalies.

The hypothesis is carbon emissions heat the earth. This fails to recognize the fact that 13000 years ago the earth was covered in ice. It warmed naturally. Not because of industrialized farming or carbon emissions. That heating mechanism is still unknown. They use ice cores to estimate average temperature on the scales of years.. But you can't use those cores to estimate daily highs and lows in temperature. As a result we think we know what weather was like in the past but in reality we only know AVERAGE temperatures on large time scales. We simply don't have the resolution necessary to make causal determinations.

I remember  in the 1990s a large percentage of scientists claimed that there will be no more ice caps by 2015.. then 2016.. Scientists don't say that anymore. Now its 2045. They were wrong then and are now. Is it because we are just smarter and more environmentally conscious human beings and thus have delayed the great melt? no. In fact we produce as a species MORE waste and carbon dioxide than ever before, thanks to global industrialization. Yet the lie continues. We have even observed a shrinking of the hole in the ozone! Did we do that? Or are natural forces at play?

We can barely predict the weather tomorrow afternoon. 50% chance of precipitation (lolz) What makes us think we can predict 20 years from now? And even then, what makes us think we could change it any observerable way within our lifetime even if we were correct. 

I am all for quality driven environmentalism. Lets get the plastic out of the ocean. Lets get the haze out of the air. But its sort of like exercise. It will make you feel better. Might even make you look better. But don't promise people they'll live longer. Because no one knows.

It does not cause a run away feedback loop that raises temperatures millions of degrees, so to would the earth not continuously increase in temperature.

I am not debating the laws of thermodynamics. I'm skeptical of the long term irreversible impact of carbon emissions and their impact on geological and biological processes that have been demonstrated to be self regulating for billions of years. Climate activists ignore this.

Example: Claiming our oceans are warming and killing sea life. If our oceans are warming, wouldn't sealife simply migrate to higher latitudes.. producing the same amount of food, oxygen, and carbon dioxide? Their models are far too ridged and narrow minded.

This video also suggests hundreds of millions of displaced refugees. If it were so hot that people couldn't live there it would be likely too hot to operate vehicles which would reduce carbon emissions. Wouldnt the temperatures then go down?

For climate you measure in 1 year cicluses!
You measure every day 365 days average temp. from all that days and than calculate what was average temp. on that PLACE in that year. and for example it's  60F or 15¬∞C . We have such a data for almost all stations on the world from year 1880. 
Then you make a graph that present all that temp. from all stations in the world and their average year temp. from 1880 year to today and look what is going on to GLOBAL temp . of whole world combined and you get something like this.
Since is not allowed to post links or pictures in comment section of this channel you have to google it for such a graph to see.
Type in google (copy paste):  global year temp history from 1880 year 
and adjust google search to images and you will find that Earth temp. have go up about 1.1¬∞C or transformed to F it's about 2F from 1880 to today.

Much warmer temperatures by several degrees that existed several hundred years ago did not result in rising sea levels and flooding of coastal cities around the world.  Ice cores taken in polar regions confirm what solar scientists tell us, that the rise in percentage of CO2 follows, not precedes a rise in temperature.

Funds for research and other projects must follow the accepted current created by continued efforts to push points of view that are given mainstream attention in the press and supported by those scientists who are elevated in this process of ongoing crisis management [ongoing crises serve through division by any means, something that is increasingly apparent as corporate funds are involved in Antifa and BLM groups as well as the few ""white supremacist"" groups created for this purpose -- These are in reality less extreme today, or no one would join them]. This kind of influence also serves in other institutions of science, such as when human remains are found in burial sites that lay in or below geological strata that is demonstrated to be several million years older than what current theory dictates.  Rather than accept the new evidence according to its merits, the scientists involved are often discredited and ignored, or excuses are created in an attempt to discredit the evidence.  For this subject, look for the book by Michael Cremo called Forbidden Archeology.  The subject matter of global warming AKA climate change is no different.  The underlying agenda is eugenics based so that most or all scientists in support of the global warming agenda in fact know that it is not viable but believe in ""saving the planet"" by drastic means of toxification through various methods in order to bring about a severe population reduction.  This philosophy has been in effect for 90+ years and began to be implemented in a big way in the 40's using the war in order to justify the introduction and normalization of toxic preservatives for example [after the banning of non-toxic preservatives like boric acid] and heavy use of pesticides, nitrates and other agricultural chemicals.  This process continued as the chemical industry was used to provide toxic solutions to many other industries in a process of normalization so that we grew to accept many things without questioning their effect upon our lives and the environment.  Now those in the know [some scientists for example] are led to believe that these developments are part of the human scourge that must be eliminated, when in fact this toxification and normalization process has been occurring in a scourge as such that has been perpetrated upon people.  Such corrupt influence for many decades could very well promote the benign development of chemical and biological solutions, such as some who have taken the initiative in that regard in recent decades. When the most powerful interests in terms of money and influence play both sides of this game of environmental morality for their benefit alone, this is clearly not a sign of sincerity for anyone who can look beyond their immediate role in whether they get funding, or whether one accepts the latest media report.  Even worse is being perpetrated now in the form of geoengineering as a real threat to the Earth and environment through the massive aerosol spraying of toxic nano aluminum, barium compounds and other toxic substances that fill the air downwind as well as accumulate in the soil over time.  This also involves the use of convergent frequencies in a corruption of technologies developed by Nikola Tesla in order to manipulate the weather and geology of the Earth.  Those who control portions of our government in this process are also those who use global warming / climate change as a cover for these activities with the nominal intent of distributing such material in the atmosphere in order to reflect sunlight back out into space.  NASA data conflicts with such efforts as it demonstrates no increase in mean global temperatures since the 1990's.  When covering the global warming agenda, the great amount of corruption involved is also ignored by the media, involving cherry picked data and the email scandal revealing this intent and the suppression of a much warmer period [by several degrees] several hundred years ago, during which no flooding occurred in coastal cities from rising sea levels that did not take place.",UC-UOZmTGRJQy30mLTOzUOBw,1.0,UgzCS975zPv8XY9pwud4AaABAg,gzksqQDI_kE,2020-07-27T09:00:09Z,climate crisis

I don't think you're quite right about the majority of science experts, though.  Some, maybe, but not the majority. They're mostly have middle incomes, despite being easily smart enough to earn much more than this, if they gave up doing science to go work on Wall Street or tell lies about science for some think tank. But they don't - because they're actually obsessed with science.  It's kinda addictive.  Look at it this way: if most experts could be bought, Exxon Mobil and all the rest would have simply bribed thousands of scientists to ""confess"" that climate change is a hoax, years and years ago.  Why wouldn't they, when there are $trillions at stake?

I think we get a misleading idea of who ""experts"" are from the media, who constantly have interviews with so-called ""experts"" who often turn out to have no idea what they're talking about.  Think about all the bogus ""experts"" talking about fad diets and other nonsense... Or the mainstream economists they had on TV in 2007, to tell us, don't worry, nothing to see here, all this talk of an impending financial crisis is just alarmist nonsense... 

And generations of people, over the past 40 years or so, have been endlessly told by media ""experts"" that - after some period of painful austerity, perhaps - we're going to be much better off, thanks to tax cuts and trickle-down prosperity.  But we all know now, that was total BS, so we've learned to mistrust experts in general... And that'a a big mistake, because media shills are unrepresentative of scientific experts, as a group.

Jesus makes it a point to tell us to ""Do to others as you would have then do to you"", which to me could mean that we are all connected somehow in a less obvious way. Like you and me are one and the same and are having this conversation because it is important for our growth. As far as Earth is concerned and the meek, I believe the Earth is our garden and God is giving us, the meek, all of us, an opportunity to care for this garden. We have been given the reins again inspite of everything... actually I would say he never truly kicked us out of his garden, just showed us there was so much more. Sure he has room for us in heaven but who knows who will receive judgement in their favor in the end. And who knows how important death actually is to our journey with God, since Jesus rose and was lifted after his dead. My point is science is just a tool to til the Earth and reach out into the cosmos around us; how we use it or neglect to use it is what is important, and the only way we are going to change things for the better here on this garden is if we plan on continuing to live conveniently then we should adhere to expert advice on what is happening in our world, because God is giving us a big Neon sign with this global warming issue and instead of blaming scientists, who are just trying to make the world a better place, we need to ask our politicians to treat our garden, our Earth seriously and tell them how important it is for our children and children's children that we act now.

But I have to point out, assuming you have some knowledge of, and believe, the Adam and Eve account, that Adam died because he disobeyed God, with sin and death as it's consequences for us all. consider this, if adam had obeyed, and continued to obey God, does that mean he would still be alive today? Do you not think that it was Gods will for them, and their children, to live forever here on earth, without bringing it to ruin, not heaven? Does he not have enough angels?

I assume you already know that this figure comes from a study which analysed the text of all peer reviewed papers published in climate science over a period of several years.  The finding was that 97% of these papers explicitly expressed agreement with AGW (the view that human activity leading to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases is the overwhelming driving force behind the current rise of global temperatures the past few decades) whereas 3% are either ambivalent (not sure), or explicitly disagree with AGW.  

I'd like to know your source for the claim that ""many names are written upon supporting documents against their wishes"".  I guess what you're imagining here is this: lots of scientific papers have multiple authors, and in some cases, author's names are included ""against their wishes"", since the don't agree with AGW.  In order for the 97% statistic to be seriously off target, let's say, as low as 50% or 60% or even 70% - this would have to have happened THOUSANDS of times (since there are tens of thousands of papers).

The 97% figure is based on analysis of statements in peer-reviewed published papers on climate change, which either (1) state their agreement with AGW (the view that human activity is the overwhelmingly predominant cause of the current rise in global temperature) or (2) either totally or partially disagree. So, contrary to your claim, those who think human impact on climate change is only small or moderate are NOT counted as part of the 97%.  Those people are amongst the 3% outside of the consensus.

Someone has issues goes to get help a bunch of brainwashed sky god worshipers tell him someone loves him and can help him but only if he helps himself. Those same people give him all the help he needs until he does something they don't agree with and then they cut him loose and by then he thinks god is punishing him so he grovels back to that cult or spirals back to where he was before. Or you start a company and the entire cult gives you contacts and helps you build your business and they all blame the god for the great fortune you've had but then this person does something the cult doesn't like and they start to destroy that persons business and some how it's gods work.
Religion is a tool used for millennia by elites to keep the poor inline and compliant. And if you can't see that then their no helping you.
I don't need a crutch because I live on a beautiful planet which gives life to countless plants and animals for my and their survival and all of this was how the universe works and god had no more to do with it then the Roman gods or Greek gods or Norse gods had to do with it. Some people are good people and others are bad people. Maybe religion will make a bad person hide his badness from society but looking around the world today I think they found a way to execute that inner badness into killing our loving mother Earth. Most planet killers on this Earth are doing it in that god of yours name and if that's what your all knowing all powerful god let's people do I'm not gonna be one to worship him. The Christians, the Jews and the Muslims are all the same death cult of human extinction. They actually actively try to bring on the end of the world so that their god can choose the righteous.

IPCC\97%ers Warmers: Fossil fuel consumption is a major cause of climate change. ~Biofuels~ can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and thus reduce carbon dioxide emissions because biofuels are carbon neutral. More specifically, the carbon dioxide that is emitted when ~biofuels~ are burned merely returns to the atmospheric carbon dioxide that was taken into plants from the atmosphere by photosynthesis.

Radioactive material is spread widely, but still in a limited area. Regarding the danger, it is not a problem how wide it gets spread, but where it is actually dangerous. There is often fear about radioactivity without significant actual harm.
When radioactive material distributes more, it is diluted. Measurement of radioactivity is extremely sensitive, so you can measure it even when it is completely harmless.
There is everywhere a little bit radiation, including where you are, but that is harmless, as you notice. It is called background radiation.
After the Chernobyl accident, more people died from the psychological effects like fear of radioactivity causing depression and then suicide, effects of constant stress and others, than from radioactivity.
That does not mean these deaths are not serious, but they are only little dependent on the actual radioactivity.
For example: A larger area of spreading of radioactive material sounds more dangerous, but makes it actually less harmful.",UCzrLAnugeDwFX_ZGsUkWqww,1.0,UgxCx3mi6nqtszXdR1t4AaABAg,oQeok_5j2So,2020-07-08T14:11:52Z,climate crisis

About 25-30 years ago, I was reading articles posted by NASA revealing that other planets in our Solar System were also showing signs of Global warming.
NASA went on to say they believed the reason to be Cosmic radiation from space passing through.
Then they seemed to forgot what they knew...
Personally I believe climate is changing, largely by natural causation with man possibly contributing.
I've thought about NASA's own words towards explaining what the cause might be, if not CO2.
CO2 is 1/2200  of our atmospheric concentration; our earth is actually starving for carbon.
While a commercial greenhouse is maintained around 1200 rpm, our atmosphere is 1/3 that.
The sun, according to Valentina Zharkova, a mathematician and Astrophysicist is at its lowest point of magnetic field strength due to cycles variance within its circulating fields of plasma that lie beneath the surface.
The sun is stable but cycles occur and they can be found in our history.
This topic has become highly politicized and with that comes political and economic benefit.
If a climate treaty should be signed for a problem now described as a 100 trillion dollar issue, the amount of control over e very govt body on the planet would be staggering.
Money held and directed by who?
Legislation to shape industry and who would be selected to receive contracts.

Mankind consumes 100 million barrels a day = 3 billion a month = 36 billion PA.
9 billion barrels is 27 billion barrels short of what is required.

After hearing of Gore's summary of his findings, Prof. Maslowski later responded, ""‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear to me how this figure was arrived at... I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this.‚Äù

He also stated in an interview with Katie Couric in 2006 that if nothing changes within 15 to 20 or even 50 years, we would see, among other things, ""sea level increases of 20 feet or more"" (followed by a graphic of large portions of Florida being covered by rising water level). He continues, ""the World Trade Center memorial site would be under water.""

The potential NEGATIVE effects to control Earth's temperature, by TERRAFORMING our planet via SPRAYING/INJECTING small AEROSOL PARTICLES into the STRATOSPHERE, is NOT being diligently characterized! Atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are recognized by the IPCC as the MAIN SOURCE of ""uncertainty in present radiative forcing and climate models.""
Why not share the truth, relevant facts and, EMPIRICAL DATA instead of BS ""settled science"" of causal inferences, obtained from the ARRHENIUS FORMULA for CO2 (only 0.04% of atmosphere), then apply that change of temperature to the WHOLE [global] CLIMATE SYSTEM?!?!?
EMPIRICAL DATA has been collected, and connected in new ways to give a COHERENT, and LOGICAL illustration, to better understand our ATMOSPHERE, and CLIMATE SYSTEM...and how human manipulation via CLIMATE ENGINEERING, and POLLUTANT AEROSOLS affects the ENTIRE GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM.
Nucleation of new AEROSOL particles via 'gas to particle conversion' has been studied for 50 years and is responsible for around one-half of global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which affect Earth‚Äôs radiation balance via AEROSOL-CLOUD interactions. The involvement of oxidized organic molecules in the process, alongside SULPHURIC ACID, was proposed in early studies and has been WELL-ESTABLISHED for some time.
The truth is, that human deposition of SULFURIC ACID via stratospheric GEOENGINEERING with SULFATE AEROSOLS, PERTURBATED (ie. heated) in our atmosphere, resulting in Secondary Organic AEROSOLS (SOAs), and combining with carbonaceous (PFOS) AEROSOLS...both, major component of our FINE-PARTICLE-POLLUTION, and the most likely contributing factor to CLIMATE CHANGE!!!
The truth is, that human [anthropogenic] sources of ATMOSPHERIC SULFUR OXIDES, including SULFURIC ACID deposition from STRATOSPHERIC CLIMATE ENGINEERING utilizing SULFATE POLLUTANT AEROSOLS and burning of fossil fuels, accounts for 75% to 80% of the HUMAN PRODUCTION of SULFUR OXIDES, in our AIR...the US ALONE, releases about 20 MILLION TONS of SULFUR DIOXIDE into our air, EACH YEAR...to put it into perspective, the large eruption of the volcanic Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, released between 15 and 30 MILLION TONS.
The truth is, that THERMAL DIFFUSION of CO2 shows it LOSES the ENERGY, absorbed almost instantaneously, leaving NO PLACE for any kind of STORAGE of THERMAL ENERGY by CO2, in our ATMOSPHERE! SUN ANGLE, which affects BACK RADIATION through WATER VAPOR, increases ATMOSPHERIC TEMP...the effect of BACK RADIATION through WATER VAPOR, is as high as 200 TIMES that of CO2, and WORKS CONVERSELY. Therefore, CO2 has a NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT (if any) on ATMOSPHERIC TEMP and CLIMATE...limiting its consumption will have, as NEGLIGIBLE of an effect!
The truth is, the planet has shown itself to be FAR LESS sensitive to increases in CO2 than the CLIMATE MODELS suggest, and much more sensitive to CLIMATE  ENGINEERING our ATMOSPHERE,  INJECTING AEROSOLS/POLLUTANTS, AND OTHER CHARGED PARTICLES (to include military/civilian rockets, craft/vehicle's and munitions exhaust/pollutants as particles) comprised of METALS AND TOXIC CHEMICALS, such as BARIUM, NICKLE CARBONYL, SULFUR OXIDES, SULFUR HEXAFLURIDE, BROMOTRIFLUOROMETHANE, etc...to then PERTURBATE these POLLUTANT AEROSOL particles into our ATMOSPHERE...utilizing HIGH POWER RADIO WAVES (HAARP, Arecibo Arecibo, EISCAT, Tromso, etc.) from SPACE, and GROUND STATIONS! Consequently, creating Secondary Organic AEROSOLS (SOAs), combined with CARBONACEOUS (PFOS) AEROSOLS...both, major component of our FINE-PARTICLE-POLLUTION, and the most likely contributing factor to CLIMATE CHANGE!!!
The trick of climate doomsayers is to draw their conclusions, obtained from the ARRHENIUS FORMULA for CO2 (only 0.04% of atmosphere), and then apply that change of temperature to the WHOLE [global] CLIMATE SYSTEM; this is BAD SCIENCE, at best...closer to FRAUD! Is the ATMOSPHERE ONLY composed of CO2...then why CLAIM the change of temperature of a mass, of TRACE GAS CO2, now becomes the change in temp of the ENTIRE, GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM?!?! Even if Arrhenius was right, ANY CHANGE obtained from his formula, is EXCLUSIVELY a change of temperature of the MASS of CO2, NOT of the ENTIRE ATMOSPHERE!!!
The truth is, SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2) itself is a POLLUTANT, and major culprit in the deposition of ACID RAIN, and our CLIMATE CHANGE. SO2 is a dense, colorless, TOXIC, non-flammable gas, which oxidizes, via several chemical pathways, to SULFUR TRIOXIDE (SO3). At normal temperature and pressure, oxygen-rich SO3 is liquid...however, it is highly REACTIVE in the ATMOSPHERE, combining with WATER VAPOR/droplets to produce SULFURIC ACID DEPOSITION (H2SO4), known better as ACID RAIN! The source of the increased RAINFALL ACIDITY is NOT industrial emissions of SULFUR DIOXIDE alone, but  SULFATE AEROSOLS/POLLUTION often carried several hundred kilometers from where ""INJECTED.""
ACID PRECIPITATION accelerates exchange processes at all surfaces, and causes leaching and mobilization of metal ions (especially Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, and Zn) from soils, and bedrock...both aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems have been affected by ACIDIFICATION, but the most OBVIOUS EFFECTS to date are on FRESHWATER systems.
Since the 1960's, collection of rainfall at recording stations has led to the recognition that the CHEMISTRY OF THE RAIN HAS CHANGED...especially in its INCREASING SULFATE and hydrogen ion content...the pH DECREASED, and areas receiving ACIDIC RAIN have EXPANDED! INORGANIC ACIDITY contributes to the acidity of the rain, with SULFURIC ACIDS and nitric acids accounting for 95% of this acidity...SULFURIC contributing 2.5 to 3 times MORE than nitric! 
The concentration of SULFUR DIOXIDE in clean air is around 0.01 ppm or less but in heavily ""sprayed"" (INJECTED; then PERTURBATED), POLLUTED urban environments, the concentration RISES to between 0.1ppm and 2ppm...10 to 200 FOLD INCREASE! Most fossil fuels (including aviation/jet fuel) have SULFUR, and when burned, COMBINES with oxygen to generate SULFUR OXIDES. 
Excess SULFUR OXIDE (SO2) has been linked to abnormally LOW OZONE LEVELS...SO2 DEPLETES the OZONE LAYER by reducing the solar flux it absorbs, between 180 nm-390 nm...the same range for the photolysis of O2, which is NECESSARY for OZONE production..since photolysis is reduced, OZONE production is also REDUCED!
The truth is, over exposure to SULFUR can DAMAGE the internal ENZYME SYSTEMS of humans and animals. SULFUR can also cause IRRITATION of the eyes, and throat when INHALED, while in the GASEOUS PHASE. Due to the possibilities of DESTRUCTION, of the SULFUR BONDS, the DAMAGING EFFECTS of SULFUR is mostly BRAIN DAMAGE...through malfunctioning of the HYPOTHALAMUS, and DAMAGE to the NERVOUS SYSTEM. Research has indicated, SULFUR can cause SERIOUS VASCULAR DAMAGE in veins of the BRAINS, the HEART and KIDNEYS...these tests have also indicated, certain forms of SULFUR can cause FETAL DAMAGE, and CONGENITAL EFFECTS...MOTHERS can even CARRY SULFUR POISONING over to their CHILDREN, through BREAST MILK!
The truth is, most SCIENTISTS studying our CLIMATE are ""EXPERTS"" in only a SMALL AREA, and NOT AWARE of Earth‚Äôs OVERALL CLIMATE SYS...nor of the endless RESEARCH studies, PROJECTS and implementations of different technologies/techniques being developed and utilized. 
The truth is, existing international law only imposes a few PROCEDURAL DUTIES, on States who are responsible for CLIMATE ENGINEERING field research...as well as a handful of particular prohibitions, and constraints. These CLIMATE ENGINEERING / GEOENGINEERING methods pose a FAR GREATER RISK to humans, and the environment...more than any current law/regulation could curtail...and far, FAR BEYOND any WISHFUL outcome, associated with manipulating our CLIMATE SYSTEM!!!
Bottom line (AKA ""THE TRUTH""); stratospheric GEOENGINEERING with SULFATE AEROSOLS, is the most prolific and significant factor, in our Secondary Organic AEROSOL (SOA and PFOS) FINE-PARTICLE-POLLUTION, and our CLIMATE CHANGE!
*STOP WITH THE DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO PUSH A CAP-AND-TRADE, CARBON CREDIT/TAX FRAUD...AND START TELLING THE TRUTH!!!*

In an article summarizing the scientists‚Äô findings, which were originally published this week in the journal Nature‚Ä¶

A new study produced by a¬†University of Wisconsin-Madison geoscientist and Northwestern astrophysicist provides an interesting ¬†explanation of the fluctuations of the earth‚Äôs temperatures that global warming liberals that blame mankind are sure to be furious about.
C.E. Dyer¬†at The Federalist Papers Project reports that the study found that small changes in the Earth‚Äôs orbit can change the amount of solar radiation that the planet receives, which could account for the changes. As the study noted, ‚Äúwhere and how much solar radiation a planet gets is a key driver of climate.‚Äù

The Daily Wire reported:
While the theory that solar radiation is the most significant factor determining global temperatures is anything but new, the team of scientists have reportedly tied the phenomenon¬†to planetary orbits in a more concrete manner than previous studies.
In¬†an article¬†summarizing the scientists‚Äô findings, which were originally published this¬†week in the journal Nature, the University of Wisconsin-Madison¬†notes that the study¬†‚Äúprovides the first hard proof for what scientists call the ‚Äòchaotic solar system,‚Äô¬†a theory proposed in 1989 to account for small variations in the present conditions of the solar system.‚Äù Those¬†variations over millions of years ‚Äúproduce big changes in our planet‚Äôs climate.‚Äù
Not only does the new discovery promise¬†to provide a¬†better understanding of ‚Äúthe mechanics of the solar system,‚Äù but also ‚Äúa better understanding of the link between orbital variations and climate change over geologic time scales.‚Äù
While this huge discovery should be welcome to everyone, those in the business of making money off of the man-made climate change hoax, as well as gaining power and control from it, won‚Äôt be pleased.


¬†Those who claim to care about the environment, if they truly do, should be very interested and encouraged by developments like this. But as we all know, the vast majority won‚Äôt be, because this development hurts their radical agenda.

This is, however, a fascinating development that adds to the growing evidence, including common sense, that shows how absurd it is to cripple our economy and follow the whims of the man-made climate change snake-oil salesmen.

Between this development and reports that the polar bears are thriving, hoaxers like Al Gore are really having a rough time.

https://youtu.be/c3bdUk4qa0Y

Many people have believed the carbon dioxide demon when the truth is quite evidently right in front of their eyes. The stripping of forests for plantations and habitats has changed the climate. 

The planet‚Äôs climate has been controlled by life forms for 3 billion years as seen by earths carbon dioxide level of a mere 0.04% against our two neighbours mars and Venus that have 90%+ carbon dioxide. The burgeoning human population struggled to feed its own with grains that caused forests that bound soils and moisture to be ripped up and replaced with dry fields with no topsoil retention. So plant life‚Äôs grip on the climate was weakened and the climate shifted slightly. 

The solution is to return the forests and feed the population at the same time. New plant factories in the Netherlands (53¬∞N) are able to compete with agriculture in the tropics to produce our food in a fraction of the space and with a fraction of the water required by conventional agriculture.

Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests

It‚Äôs now possible with plant factories to make a country like Britain self-sufficient in food and return its arable land to forests. It just requires the focus of resources.

The biggest problems spreading this American Psychosis are the lack of access to education; and corruption.

Your best weapon in bringing on *REAL* *CHANGE* is your *VOTE*

I'm honestly dumbfounded that Americans had the chance to elect Bernie twice! And twice they wanted to stick to their hard lives and make *INCREMENTAL* changes. Blows my mind.

Want your voices to be heard? Abolish the *Electoral College*  Then you will have a *REAL* *DEMOCRACY*

This should be an organized movement. Showing people that this socialism that's being thrown around is just mumbojumbo, and that what European and nordicy countries are is capitalists. Capitalism that *WORKS*
Show people how in a functioning capitalistic society you pay taxes and you get back for what you pay. In the USA people pay taxes but they get nothing in return. These taxes should go back to the people in forms of improved educational system, unobstructed access to healthcare when needed, improvement to the infrastructure and travel and making cities and roads accessable. 
Adopt the modern standards of Nordic countries in policing. Adapt their path to becoming a law enforcement officer. You study for it, actually study for a few years, learn about the job, about human psychology so you know how to approach and deal with people and evaluate situations off of that. Get proper training. Not whatever boyish videogame fantasy stuff they teach you in the US where the officer are always fearing for their own lives and always being ready to *KILL*",UCouv6fG0EN0STX40e2cidtQ,0.0,Ugwo4T23JC7cet6Zlgx4AaABAg,AH6-3C1yviA,2020-12-28T15:59:51Z,climate crisis

But that's not enough, not by a long shot. We need to continue FFF and Extinction Rebellion, show that only because there has been a pandemic, those aren't dead. And we have to exert pressure through protests and also strikes onto politicians to not return to the old ways but to build the economy back in a green way. And we have to back those up who are in favour of it or at least openly speak out for it.

Most countries are dependent of others for their food and clothing, and other products. That's the problem, especially in the northern rich countries. We'd have to adapt, and it would be difficult for most people, to a world where everyone must help the other, work in the fields to produce food, share things, such as washing machines or cars between neighbours... Most of the poorer countries wouldn't really feel the change of a societal ''collapse''. But they will feel the more direct effects of climate change, with much less food and water, and more floods and catastrophic events. And this all will begin in the years to come, when the oil will become even rarer than now.

Thorium energy can process both nuclear and toxic waste, as well as make salt water desalination and carbon sequestration economically viable. They can also power synthetic fuel manufacture for all forms of transport. Thorium reactors cannot be weaponized. 

""The thorium molten salt power plant can produce clean energy cheaper than coal, which could be a reliable energy system toward a low carbon economy"" PAL said.

If the profits from American labour were shared equally as they are with corporate shareholders, every household¬† would receive $700k annually. If we got even a fraction of that we would have more than enough to fund education, healthcare and infrastructure for everybody. 

52% of all greenhouse gases come from methane produced by Beef farming, which is currently 90% subsidized. Ending Beef Communism and embracing Hemp and Kelp farming as Moonshot technologies for use in packaging, construction, manufacturing, medicines, insulation, and clothing could alleviate the worst of climate change, sequester carbon, revitalize crop land and restore depleted habitats. 

It would also be conducive to have an independent public authority¬† drawing from volunteers to act as third party advocates for the public interest, with the authority to charge and prosecute bad actors and cops and prosecute them in our own courts. This would ensure both Government and Law Enforcement are held to the highest standards of etiquette, ethical conduct, and equality of outcome regardless of Creed Color, or Economic bracket.

This pattern typically has four stages: STAGE 1. THE ‚ÄúCRISIS‚Äù: Some situation exists, whose negative aspects the anointed propose to eliminate. Such a situation is routinely characterized as a ‚Äúcrisis,‚Äù even though all human situations have negative aspects, and even though evidence is seldom asked or given to show how the situation at hand is either uniquely bad or threatening to get worse. Sometimes the situation described as a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù has in fact already been getting better for years. STAGE 2. THE ‚ÄúSOLUTION‚Äù: Policies to end the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù are advocated by the anointed, who say that these policies will lead to beneficial result A. Critics say that these policies will lead to detrimental result Z. The anointed dismiss these latter claims as absurd and ‚Äúsimplistic,‚Äù if not dishonest. STAGE 3. THE RESULTS: The policies are instituted and lead to detrimental result Z. STAGE 4. THE RESPONSE: Those who attribute detrimental result Z to the policies instituted are dismissed as ‚Äúsimplistic‚Äù for ignoring the ‚Äúcomplexities‚Äù involved, as ‚Äúmany factors‚Äù went into determining the outcome. The burden of proof is put on the critics to demonstrate to a certainty that these policies alone were the only possible cause of the worsening that occurred.

2)Plants of today have evolved for today's conditions. Not only will the climatological conditions from climate change harm crops and crop yields but the increase in CO2 may reacht he point where you reverse the relationship between C3 photosynthetic plants and C4 photosynthetic plants.  This means that hydroponics will be the only stable way to make food until we hit some equilibrium.


3)Entire regions will become uninghabitable to both crops and humans. these same regions lack the means required for them to do the radical infrastructure changes required for them to adapt, this means dozens, if not hundreds,  of millions of refugees.

Do you have an answer to that geopolitical fuckup?

4) Yes, methane an issue. Here's 2 solutions to that: getting our animal protein from lab grown meat and aquaculture.
There's also mitigation methods such as seaweed rich diet.

5) What we are observing is not because of us exiting an ice age. The rate and scale of the heatup is beyond what ecosystems can adapt to and is in fact enough to trigger feedback loops.

6) the poles were tropical 55 million years ago. We no longer have that ecosystem.

The solution is a Velvet Revolution to install a Scaled Direct Democracy, without representatives or politicians. Citizens initiated referendums with thresholds and a social contract using blockchain technology means communities can vote their own policies without politicians.
*Thorium Energy renders their global oil monopoly obsolete.* 

*#VelvetRevolution*
*#ScaledDirectDemocracy*
*#ThoriumEnergy*
Thorium energy can process both nuclear and toxic waste, as well as make salt water desalination and carbon sequestration economically viable. They can also power synthetic fuel manufacture for all forms of transport. Thorium reactors cannot be weaponized. 

""The thorium molten salt power plant can produce clean energy cheaper than coal, which could be a reliable energy system toward a low carbon economy"" PAL said.

If the profits from American labour were shared equally as they are with corporate shareholders, every household¬† would receive $700k annually. If we got even a fraction of that we would have more than enough to fund education, healthcare and infrastructure for everybody. 

52% of all greenhouse gases come from methane produced by Beef farming, which is currently 90% subsidized. Ending Beef Communism and embracing Hemp and Kelp farming as Moonshot technologies for use in packaging, construction, manufacturing, medicines, insulation, and clothing could alleviate the worst of climate change, sequester carbon, revitalize crop land and restore depleted habitats. 

It would also be conducive to have an independent public authority¬† drawing from volunteers to act as third party advocates for the public interest, with the authority to charge and prosecute bad actors and cops and prosecute them in our own courts. This would ensure both Government and Law Enforcement are held to the highest standards of etiquette, ethical conduct, and equality of outcome regardless of Creed Color, or Economic bracket.

Thorium energy can process both nuclear and toxic waste, as well as make salt water desalination and carbon sequestration economically viable. They can also power synthetic fuel manufacture for all forms of transport. Thorium reactors cannot be weaponized. 

""The thorium molten salt power plant can produce clean energy cheaper than coal, which could be a reliable energy system toward a low carbon economy"" PAL said.

If the profits from American labour were shared equally as they are with corporate shareholders, every household¬† would receive $700k annually. If we got even a fraction of that we would have more than enough to fund education, healthcare and infrastructure for everybody. 

52% of all greenhouse gases come from methane produced by Beef farming, which is currently 90% subsidized. Ending Beef Communism and embracing Hemp and Kelp farming as Moonshot technologies for use in packaging, construction, manufacturing, medicines, insulation, and clothing could alleviate the worst of climate change, sequester carbon, revitalize crop land and restore depleted habitats. 

It would also be conducive to have an independent public authority¬† drawing from volunteers to act as third party advocates for the public interest, with the authority to charge and prosecute bad actors and cops and prosecute them in our own courts. This would ensure both Government and Law Enforcement are held to the highest standards of etiquette, ethical conduct, and equality of outcome regardless of Creed Color, or Economic bracket.

Thorium energy can process both nuclear and toxic waste, as well as make salt water desalination and carbon sequestration economically viable. They can also power synthetic fuel manufacture for all forms of transport. Thorium reactors cannot be weaponized.

52% of all greenhouse gases come from methane produced by Beef farming, which is currently 90% subsidized. Ending Beef Communism and embracing Hemp and Kelp farming as Moonshot technologies for use in packaging, construction, manufacturing, medicines, insulation, and clothing could alleviate the worst of climate change, sequester carbon, revitalize crop land and restore depleted habitats. 

It would also be conducive to have an independent public authority¬† drawing from volunteers to act as third party advocates for the public interest, with the authority to charge and prosecute bad actors and cops and prosecute them in our own courts.

It is things like this just make me want this cruel world to become a progressive left wing anarchy.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that this keeps happening as a result of these fucking Nazis. Words cannot describe how angry and sad I am about this.

I live near Houston and the cops being present in the schools here is very concerning because pretty much every school and college are campuses of color.

Back when I was in high school (Fall 2015 to May 2019) a lot of fights broke out and the result was different based on the skin color of the students.

If a white student got in a fight, all they got was a talking to with the principal and only about 4 days of ISS (Detention).

If a black, Hispanic, or Mexican got in a fight, they would get pinned down and immediately arrested and then they would get either expelled or suspended for at least 2 months.

I mean what would you expect when the school lets you get away with wearing a MAGA hat, Trump Flags, Confederate Flags, or anything racist and acts like sexual harassment is no big deal...

Yet A Charlie Brown Christmas is blocked and classified as ‚Äúporn‚Äù ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (not even joking)

And another huge problem is the JROTC and ROTC programs that are in our schools. They are usually present in schools of color. They are one of several reasons that there is far right wing pro war propaganda in our schools. 
What this entire fucking world needs is an international progressive left wing anarchy through an international revolution.

Titles of authority are really just there to brainwash people into thinking that they are the next Hitler.

Fuck power and fuck positions of power.

There are a few things that the Coronavirus is exposing.

1. How fascist America is.

2. How abysmal our healthcare system is.

3. How toxic capitalism is.

4. How money and power corrupt people.

5. How desperate our education system is to profit off of spreading fascist propaganda to us.

6. The same exact thing can be said about business and jobs.

7. School is nothing but a fascistic loyalty test.

8. Grades are determined by loyalty and not actual fucking knowledge.

9. The top 10% of a graduating class are just a list of the most loyal students to system.

10. The top 10% are also the same people that are NOT using common sense regarding Coronavirus.

The only ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing about the Coronavirus is an ‚Äúextended‚Äù Spring Break.... a very shitty one at that because you can‚Äôt really go anywhere... like the brainwashed Trumptards are doing.

You are welcome to add anything to this list if you want to. 

I have officially lost all of my faith in politics and am now seeing that revolution is the only way forward.

Get this,

On January 13, 2020, I started my second semester of college. I took Physical Geography online.

I noticed that the professor left link to various ‚Äúuseful‚Äù sources.

One of them said cia. gov or something like that.

Why is there a pro-CIA link on a school website?

This makes me ask the question, ‚ÄúDoes the CIA have full control over our education system?‚Äù

If that‚Äôs the case, then that explains all of the fascist propaganda in the curriculums.

In English class on December 2, 2019 me and a few students did presentations on advocating for change... with extremely biased rules and restrictions from the professors and the campus. I go to the Lone Star College system, which has 17+ campuses in the northern half of Houston Texas. We all had one extremely biased judge giving scores from 1 to 10.

Here is how it went:

Trumpet: Gives and Anti-Bernie, Anti Socialism, and Socialism is Bad presentation.

Judge: Gives a 9 or 10.

Me: Gives a presentation calling out The education system for being biased and spreading propaganda, and also calling them out for justifying the killings of Native Americans during colonialism and Manifest Destiny.

Judge: Gives me the lowest score possible... a 1, yes a fucking 1.

I even typed out an essay calling right wing propaganda in the education system... and I get a fucking 0... over quote length.

I am currently in my second year of college (sophomore year) and have gone through 16 professors (if you count the current semester) and all 16 were fascist right wing Trumptards.

Whenever a corrupt person like Trump does something ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they are not doing it from their heart, they are doing it to hide their corruption by pretending to be on our side. They do this because they know that we the people are catching on to their bias and corruption.

(The fascist education system actually does this more often than any government officials).

Stuff like this is what happens when you have a for profit fascist education system that profits off of spreading far right wing pro war propaganda to students.

Things like this are exactly why I‚Äôm against power, positions of power, money, etc. 

It has never been about protecting humans and spreading democracy. It‚Äôs always been about power, money, control, and impressing the supreme authority leader.

I‚Äôve said this many times and I‚Äôll say it again. There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as power, positions of power, money, and supreme authority leaders. They need to be abolished now.

We the people of this world are going to have to start a real deal revolution now if we want to save the planet and humanity. We are no longer going to allow supreme authority leaders to exist. Literally everything we do in life is only about blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders.

School is not actually about teaching us how to survive in the real world. Grades, standardized testing, homework, etc. Schools brainwash students into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme leader.

JROTC and ROTC programs as well as the military are not actually about teaching leadership and life skills. Their only goal is to teach you to blindly follow orders and impress the supreme authority leaders, hoping that you can be a F√ºhrer someday.

JROTC, ROTC, and militaries are extremely homophobic... especially around Valentines Day. They even quiz you on what a couple consists of.

Graduation and award ceremonies are just the system‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúCongratulations on blindly following every single order and impressing the supreme leaders. Maybe one day you will be a F√ºhrer.‚Äù

Jobs are not actually about making money in order to survive. Instead they are only about working endlessly just so the supreme leaders can make a profit.

Religions only exist because they have only one goal. To brainwash you into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders. This has caused several wars to break out results in millions of deaths.

There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as the CIA, NRA, or any secret government agency as they are the definition of fascism.

Power and positions of power should not exist. All power does is cause people to want to have full control over everyone... because power only corrupts, it never helps anyone.

Money should not exist. All money does is corrupt people and cause the destruction of the planet and humanity. We need to abolish all forms of money internationally. üñïüèªüëâüèªüí©üíµ

Countries and borders are a pathetic way for supreme leaders to keep us divided from each other and tell us where we can and cannot go.

We should not have to rely on making money and working just so we can survive. We should be able to survive by doing whatever we want to do with our lives. Whether it be traveling, playing video games, designing video games, or eating your favorite meals. You should be able to survive by doing whatever you want to do with your life. Not what some supreme leaders tell you to do in order to survive.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand:.

No more money.

No more religions.

No more NRA. 

No more CIA.

No more power.

No more positions of power.

No more censorship.

No more borders.

No more fascism.

No more countries.

No more supreme leaders.

No more governments. 

Fix the education system.

Fix the way life functions.

Save Net Neutrality.

And most importantly, Save the planet from catastrophic climate change.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand for no more power, money, supreme authority leaders, etc.

We demand for freedom in a world controlled by we the people of this world.

No more supreme leaders.

We need a revolution for we the people of this world to start now.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that this keeps happening as a result of these fucking Nazis. Words cannot describe how angry and sad I am about this.

I live near Houston and the cops being present in the schools here is very concerning because pretty much every school and college are campuses of color.

Back when I was in high school (Fall 2015 to May 2019) a lot of fights broke out and the result was different based on the skin color of the students.

If a white student got in a fight, all they got was a talking to with the principal and only about 4 days of ISS (Detention).

If a black, Hispanic, or Mexican got in a fight, they would get pinned down and immediately arrested and then they would get either expelled or suspended for at least 2 months.

I mean what would you expect when the school lets you get away with wearing a MAGA hat, Trump Flags, Confederate Flags, or anything racist and acts like sexual harassment is no big deal...

Yet A Charlie Brown Christmas is blocked and classified as ‚Äúporn‚Äù ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (not even joking)

And another huge problem is the JROTC and ROTC programs that are in our schools. They are usually present in schools of color. They are one of several reasons that there is far right wing pro war propaganda in our schools. 
What this entire fucking world needs is an international progressive left wing anarchy through an international revolution.

Titles of authority are really just there to brainwash people into thinking that they are the next Hitler.

Fuck power and fuck positions of power.

There are a few things that the Coronavirus is exposing.

1. How fascist America is.

2. How abysmal our healthcare system is.

3. How toxic capitalism is.

4. How money and power corrupt people.

5. How desperate our education system is to profit off of spreading fascist propaganda to us.

6. The same exact thing can be said about business and jobs.

7. School is nothing but a fascistic loyalty test.

8. Grades are determined by loyalty and not actual fucking knowledge.

9. The top 10% of a graduating class are just a list of the most loyal students to system.

10. The top 10% are also the same people that are NOT using common sense regarding Coronavirus.

The only ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing about the Coronavirus is an ‚Äúextended‚Äù Spring Break.... a very shitty one at that because you can‚Äôt really go anywhere... like the brainwashed Trumptards are doing.

You are welcome to add anything to this list if you want to. 

I have officially lost all of my faith in politics and am now seeing that revolution is the only way forward.

Get this,

On January 13, 2020, I started my second semester of college. I took Physical Geography online.

I noticed that the professor left link to various ‚Äúuseful‚Äù sources.

One of them said cia. gov or something like that.

Why is there a pro-CIA link on a school website?

This makes me ask the question, ‚ÄúDoes the CIA have full control over our education system?‚Äù

If that‚Äôs the case, then that explains all of the fascist propaganda in the curriculums.

In English class on December 2, 2019 me and a few students did presentations on advocating for change... with extremely biased rules and restrictions from the professors and the campus. I go to the Lone Star College system, which has 17+ campuses in the northern half of Houston Texas. We all had one extremely biased judge giving scores from 1 to 10.

Here is how it went:

Trumpet: Gives and Anti-Bernie, Anti Socialism, and Socialism is Bad presentation.

Judge: Gives a 9 or 10.

Me: Gives a presentation calling out The education system for being biased and spreading propaganda, and also calling them out for justifying the killings of Native Americans during colonialism and Manifest Destiny.

Judge: Gives me the lowest score possible... a 1, yes a fucking 1.

I even typed out an essay calling right wing propaganda in the education system... and I get a fucking 0... over quote length.

I am currently in my second year of college (sophomore year) and have gone through 16 professors (if you count the current semester) and all 16 were fascist right wing Trumptards.

Whenever a corrupt person like Trump does something ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they are not doing it from their heart, they are doing it to hide their corruption by pretending to be on our side. They do this because they know that we the people are catching on to their bias and corruption.

(The fascist education system actually does this more often than any government officials).

Stuff like this is what happens when you have a for profit fascist education system that profits off of spreading far right wing pro war propaganda to students.

Things like this are exactly why I‚Äôm against power, positions of power, money, etc. 

It has never been about protecting humans and spreading democracy. It‚Äôs always been about power, money, control, and impressing the supreme authority leader.

I‚Äôve said this many times and I‚Äôll say it again. There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as power, positions of power, money, and supreme authority leaders. They need to be abolished now.

We the people of this world are going to have to start a real deal revolution now if we want to save the planet and humanity. We are no longer going to allow supreme authority leaders to exist. Literally everything we do in life is only about blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders.

School is not actually about teaching us how to survive in the real world. Grades, standardized testing, homework, etc. Schools brainwash students into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme leader.

JROTC and ROTC programs as well as the military are not actually about teaching leadership and life skills. Their only goal is to teach you to blindly follow orders and impress the supreme authority leaders, hoping that you can be a F√ºhrer someday.

JROTC, ROTC, and militaries are extremely homophobic... especially around Valentines Day. They even quiz you on what a couple consists of.

Graduation and award ceremonies are just the system‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúCongratulations on blindly following every single order and impressing the supreme leaders. Maybe one day you will be a F√ºhrer.‚Äù

Jobs are not actually about making money in order to survive. Instead they are only about working endlessly just so the supreme leaders can make a profit.

Religions only exist because they have only one goal. To brainwash you into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders. This has caused several wars to break out results in millions of deaths.

There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as the CIA, NRA, or any secret government agency as they are the definition of fascism.

Power and positions of power should not exist. All power does is cause people to want to have full control over everyone... because power only corrupts, it never helps anyone.

Money should not exist. All money does is corrupt people and cause the destruction of the planet and humanity. We need to abolish all forms of money internationally. üñïüèªüëâüèªüí©üíµ

Countries and borders are a pathetic way for supreme leaders to keep us divided from each other and tell us where we can and cannot go.

We should not have to rely on making money and working just so we can survive. We should be able to survive by doing whatever we want to do with our lives. Whether it be traveling, playing video games, designing video games, or eating your favorite meals. You should be able to survive by doing whatever you want to do with your life. Not what some supreme leaders tell you to do in order to survive.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand:.

No more money.

No more religions.

No more NRA. 

No more CIA.

No more power.

No more positions of power.

No more censorship.

No more borders.

No more fascism.

No more countries.

No more supreme leaders.

No more governments. 

Fix the education system.

Fix the way life functions.

Save Net Neutrality.

And most importantly, Save the planet from catastrophic climate change.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand for no more power, money, supreme authority leaders, etc.

We demand for freedom in a world controlled by we the people of this world.

No more supreme leaders.

We need a revolution for we the people of this world to start now.

I am currently in my second year of college (sophomore year) and have gone through 16 professors (if you count the current semester) and all 16 were fascist right wing Trumptards.

Whenever a corrupt person like Trump does something ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they are not doing it from their heart, they are doing it to hide their corruption by pretending to be on our side. They do this because they know that we the people are catching on to their bias and corruption.

(The fascist education system actually does this more often than any government officials).

Stuff like this is what happens when you have a for profit fascist education system that profits off of spreading far right wing pro war propaganda to students.

Things like this are exactly why I‚Äôm against power, positions of power, money, etc. 

It has never been about protecting humans and spreading democracy. It‚Äôs always been about power, money, control, and impressing the supreme authority leader.

I‚Äôve said this many times and I‚Äôll say it again. There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as power, positions of power, money, and supreme authority leaders. They need to be abolished now.

We the people of this world are going to have to start a real deal revolution now if we want to save the planet and humanity. We are no longer going to allow supreme authority leaders to exist. Literally everything we do in life is only about blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders.

School is not actually about teaching us how to survive in the real world. Grades, standardized testing, homework, etc. Schools brainwash students into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme leader.

JROTC and ROTC programs as well as the military are not actually about teaching leadership and life skills. Their only goal is to teach you to blindly follow orders and impress the supreme authority leaders, hoping that you can be a F√ºhrer someday.

JROTC, ROTC, and militaries are extremely homophobic... especially around Valentines Day. They even quiz you on what a couple consists of.

Graduation and award ceremonies are just the system‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúCongratulations on blindly following every single order and impressing the supreme leaders. Maybe one day you will be a F√ºhrer.‚Äù

Jobs are not actually about making money in order to survive. Instead they are only about working endlessly just so the supreme leaders can make a profit.

Religions only exist because they have only one goal. To brainwash you into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders. This has caused several wars to break out results in millions of deaths.

There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as the CIA, NRA, or any secret government agency as they are the definition of fascism.

Power and positions of power should not exist. All power does is cause people to want to have full control over everyone... because power only corrupts, it never helps anyone.

Money should not exist. All money does is corrupt people and cause the destruction of the planet and humanity. We need to abolish all forms of money internationally. üñïüèªüëâüèªüí©üíµ

Countries and borders are a pathetic way for supreme leaders to keep us divided from each other and tell us where we can and cannot go.

We should not have to rely on making money and working just so we can survive. We should be able to survive by doing whatever we want to do with our lives. Whether it be traveling, playing video games, designing video games, or eating your favorite meals. You should be able to survive by doing whatever you want to do with your life. Not what some supreme leaders tell you to do in order to survive.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand:.

No more money.

No more religions.

No more NRA. 

No more CIA.

No more power.

No more positions of power.

No more censorship.

No more borders.

No more fascism.

No more countries.

No more supreme leaders.

No more governments. 

Fix the education system.

Fix the way life functions.

Save Net Neutrality.

And most importantly, Save the planet from catastrophic climate change.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand for no more power, money, supreme authority leaders, etc.

We demand for freedom in a world controlled by we the people of this world.

No more supreme leaders.

We need a revolution for we the people of this world to start now.

Our revolution starts now.",UCWNuk4Lc3YE-KQTQIs7s7Qg,0.0,Ugw7QnNyWogL86vAUJZ4AaABAg,AH6-3C1yviA,2020-12-28T15:59:51Z,climate crisis

Had it not been for the military industrial complex, we would have been more than a half century in to Thorium reactor use already.

Thorium nuclear energy has all the benefits of Uranium but without any of the negatives - no danger of a nuclear meltdown and massive explosions, virtually negligible waste products (far less than uranium) and the waste products that are produced have a radioactive half life that is 20x less than that of Uranium.

Literally the only reason we have so many  Uranium nuclear reactors today, is because militaries wanted the byproduct of a Uranium power plant: weapons grade plutonium.

Much of the impending disaster we faced today could have been averted if our respective nuclear energy programs went with Thorium instead - we would have been 60+ years into thorium reactor  technology today and it most probably would have been commonplace in every country in the world, with no population backlash seeing as there is no danger associated with it.

Ending Beef Communism and embracing Hemp and Kelp farming as Moonshot technologies for use in packaging, construction, manufacturing, medicines, insulation, and clothing could alleviate the worst of climate change, sequester carbon, revitalize crop land and restore depleted habitats. 

It would also be conducive to have an independent public authority¬† drawing from volunteers to act as third party advocates for the public interest, with the authority to charge and prosecute bad actors and cops and prosecute them in our own courts.

The solution is a Velvet Revolution to install a Scaled Direct Democracy, without representatives or politicians. Citizens initiated referendums with thresholds and a social contract using blockchain technology means communities can vote their own policies without politicians.
*Thorium Energy renders their global oil monopoly obsolete.* 

*#VelvetRevolution*
*#ScaledDirectDemocracy*
*#ThoriumEnergy*
Thorium energy can process both nuclear and toxic waste, as well as make salt water desalination and carbon sequestration economically viable. They can also power synthetic fuel manufacture for all forms of transport. Thorium reactors cannot be weaponized. 

""The thorium molten salt power plant can produce clean energy cheaper than coal, which could be a reliable energy system toward a low carbon economy"" PAL said.

If the profits from American labour were shared equally as they are with corporate shareholders, every household¬† would receive $700k annually. If we got even a fraction of that we would have more than enough to fund education, healthcare and infrastructure for everybody. 

52% of all greenhouse gases come from methane produced by Beef farming, which is currently 90% subsidized. Ending Beef Communism and embracing Hemp and Kelp farming as Moonshot technologies for use in packaging, construction, manufacturing, medicines, insulation, and clothing could alleviate the worst of climate change, sequester carbon, revitalize crop land and restore depleted habitats. 

It would also be conducive to have an independent public authority¬† drawing from volunteers to act as third party advocates for the public interest, with the authority to charge and prosecute bad actors and cops and prosecute them in our own courts. This would ensure both Government and Law Enforcement are held to the highest standards of etiquette, ethical conduct, and equality of outcome regardless of Creed Color, or Economic bracket.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that this keeps happening as a result of these fucking Nazis. Words cannot describe how angry and sad I am about this.

I live near Houston and the cops being present in the schools here is very concerning because pretty much every school and college are campuses of color.

Back when I was in high school (Fall 2015 to May 2019) a lot of fights broke out and the result was different based on the skin color of the students.

If a white student got in a fight, all they got was a talking to with the principal and only about 4 days of ISS (Detention).

If a black, Hispanic, or Mexican got in a fight, they would get pinned down and immediately arrested and then they would get either expelled or suspended for at least 2 months.

I mean what would you expect when the school lets you get away with wearing a MAGA hat, Trump Flags, Confederate Flags, or anything racist and acts like sexual harassment is no big deal...

Yet A Charlie Brown Christmas is blocked and classified as ‚Äúporn‚Äù ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (not even joking)

And another huge problem is the JROTC and ROTC programs that are in our schools. They are usually present in schools of color. They are one of several reasons that there is far right wing pro war propaganda in our schools. 
What this entire fucking world needs is an international progressive left wing anarchy through an international revolution.

Titles of authority are really just there to brainwash people into thinking that they are the next Hitler.

Fuck power and fuck positions of power.

There are a few things that the Coronavirus is exposing.

1. How fascist America is.

2. How abysmal our healthcare system is.

3. How toxic capitalism is.

4. How money and power corrupt people.

5. How desperate our education system is to profit off of spreading fascist propaganda to us.

6. The same exact thing can be said about business and jobs.

7. School is nothing but a fascistic loyalty test.

8. Grades are determined by loyalty and not actual fucking knowledge.

9. The top 10% of a graduating class are just a list of the most loyal students to system.

10. The top 10% are also the same people that are NOT using common sense regarding Coronavirus.

The only ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing about the Coronavirus is an ‚Äúextended‚Äù Spring Break.... a very shitty one at that because you can‚Äôt really go anywhere... like the brainwashed Trumptards are doing.

You are welcome to add anything to this list if you want to. 

I have officially lost all of my faith in politics and am now seeing that revolution is the only way forward.

Get this,

On January 13, 2020, I started my second semester of college. I took Physical Geography online.

I noticed that the professor left link to various ‚Äúuseful‚Äù sources.

One of them said cia. gov or something like that.

Why is there a pro-CIA link on a school website?

This makes me ask the question, ‚ÄúDoes the CIA have full control over our education system?‚Äù

If that‚Äôs the case, then that explains all of the fascist propaganda in the curriculums.

In English class on December 2, 2019 me and a few students did presentations on advocating for change... with extremely biased rules and restrictions from the professors and the campus. I go to the Lone Star College system, which has 17+ campuses in the northern half of Houston Texas. We all had one extremely biased judge giving scores from 1 to 10.

Here is how it went:

Trumpet: Gives and Anti-Bernie, Anti Socialism, and Socialism is Bad presentation.

Judge: Gives a 9 or 10.

Me: Gives a presentation calling out The education system for being biased and spreading propaganda, and also calling them out for justifying the killings of Native Americans during colonialism and Manifest Destiny.

Judge: Gives me the lowest score possible... a 1, yes a fucking 1.

I even typed out an essay calling right wing propaganda in the education system... and I get a fucking 0... over quote length.

I am currently in my second year of college (sophomore year) and have gone through 16 professors (if you count the current semester) and all 16 were fascist right wing Trumptards.

Whenever a corrupt person like Trump does something ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they are not doing it from their heart, they are doing it to hide their corruption by pretending to be on our side. They do this because they know that we the people are catching on to their bias and corruption.

(The fascist education system actually does this more often than any government officials).

Stuff like this is what happens when you have a for profit fascist education system that profits off of spreading far right wing pro war propaganda to students.

Things like this are exactly why I‚Äôm against power, positions of power, money, etc. 

It has never been about protecting humans and spreading democracy. It‚Äôs always been about power, money, control, and impressing the supreme authority leader.

I‚Äôve said this many times and I‚Äôll say it again. There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as power, positions of power, money, and supreme authority leaders. They need to be abolished now.

We the people of this world are going to have to start a real deal revolution now if we want to save the planet and humanity. We are no longer going to allow supreme authority leaders to exist. Literally everything we do in life is only about blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders.

School is not actually about teaching us how to survive in the real world. Grades, standardized testing, homework, etc. Schools brainwash students into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme leader.

JROTC and ROTC programs as well as the military are not actually about teaching leadership and life skills. Their only goal is to teach you to blindly follow orders and impress the supreme authority leaders, hoping that you can be a F√ºhrer someday.

JROTC, ROTC, and militaries are extremely homophobic... especially around Valentines Day. They even quiz you on what a couple consists of.

Graduation and award ceremonies are just the system‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúCongratulations on blindly following every single order and impressing the supreme leaders. Maybe one day you will be a F√ºhrer.‚Äù

Jobs are not actually about making money in order to survive. Instead they are only about working endlessly just so the supreme leaders can make a profit.

Religions only exist because they have only one goal. To brainwash you into blindly following orders and impressing the supreme authority leaders. This has caused several wars to break out results in millions of deaths.

There shouldn‚Äôt be a such thing as the CIA, NRA, or any secret government agency as they are the definition of fascism.

Power and positions of power should not exist. All power does is cause people to want to have full control over everyone... because power only corrupts, it never helps anyone.

Money should not exist. All money does is corrupt people and cause the destruction of the planet and humanity. We need to abolish all forms of money internationally. üñïüèªüëâüèªüí©üíµ

Countries and borders are a pathetic way for supreme leaders to keep us divided from each other and tell us where we can and cannot go.

We should not have to rely on making money and working just so we can survive. We should be able to survive by doing whatever we want to do with our lives. Whether it be traveling, playing video games, designing video games, or eating your favorite meals. You should be able to survive by doing whatever you want to do with your life. Not what some supreme leaders tell you to do in order to survive.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand:.

No more money.

No more religions.

No more NRA. 

No more CIA.

No more power.

No more positions of power.

No more censorship.

No more borders.

No more fascism.

No more countries.

No more supreme leaders.

No more governments. 

Fix the education system.

Fix the way life functions.

Save Net Neutrality.

And most importantly, Save the planet from catastrophic climate change.

We the people of this world need to start a revolution now and demand for no more power, money, supreme authority leaders, etc.

We demand for freedom in a world controlled by we the people of this world.

No more supreme leaders.

We need a revolution for we the people of this world to start now.

Our revolution starts now.",UCWNuk4Lc3YE-KQTQIs7s7Qg,1.0,UgwP3YWU0ZWyFoTqL2t4AaABAg,AH6-3C1yviA,2020-12-28T15:59:51Z,climate crisis

It needs to socialism that empowers workers, not employers. Also, another requirement will be to undo the deep, long lasting, and society crushing SCOTUS decision of Citizens United. In other words, unless we get MONEY out of politics, and out of OUR government (it belongs to all of us, not corporations), likely with a Constitutional amendment (nobody said saving the planet or country was going to be a cakewalk unfortunately) being the only possible remedy with a 6-3 Supreme Court AND a corporate-owned Democratic Party completely unwilling to expand & pack the courts to save the future that these old ghouls won‚Äôt ever have to live through, then as much as I hate to say this, humanity is doomed. 

There WILL be an authoritarian shift and crackdown WORLDWIDE when the damage from climate change really starts to exponentially accelerate. You can kiss the idea of socialism goodbye in that case, because it ain‚Äôt gonna happen before we all end up in the ground. When climate change escalates and causes one mass refugee crisis after another the likes of which Earth has _never seen before,_ do you think the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù of the United Corporations of America is going to renege on its destructive profit-making capitalist policies and adapt to take refugees in, and make sure the lowest members of society will be safe and well taken care of? *Absolutely. Not.*
There will be an unprecedented rightward authoritarian shift, leading to the death of any remaining civil liberties, and any power that workers/unions had in the workplace. 
The scale of this catastrophe, even when compared to Covid-19 which is already hard to grasp the scale of, is going to be monumental and incomprehensible, so we need to act NOW. 

WE are the frog in warm water, with our corporate masters slowly turning up the heat to boil us alive. And before the general population realizes we‚Äôre being murdered, it‚Äôll already be too late. It would undoubtedly be a poetic end to the disgusting human empires that exist right now, but the people on the bottom are going to be the ones suffering because of it. The rich and powerful will never have to lift a finger, or experience any consequences for their actions. Jesus Christ man, this is a mental and physical burden that the youth and millennials of today should NEVER have had to deal with. The older generations have utterly failed us, and they still don‚Äôt get it, nor are they fighting with us to right THEIR wrongs.

The reason why people refuse to accept the science behind climate change is very obvious yet no one talks about it ‚Äî It has been heavily politicized. 

Because of its record of being a political issue rather than a science issue, people have accused it of being a product of political corruption, hoax, scandals, or even a huge fraudulent attempt to submit free will to an oligarchy of power-hungry governments. The origins of its politicization mostly stem from the United Nations‚Äô ‚ÄúKyoto Protocol‚Äù plan to reduce industrial emissions from affluent countries like the United States, yet for some reason countries like China and India, which have worse environmental records than the US, were exempt from the plan. They tied climate change to successful countries rather than pollutive, yet it's easy to see that the most pollutive countries are actually underdeveloped countries or ones going through industrialization. In fact, the environment was at it's worst during its industrial revolution, but much of that pollution was cleaned up in the following decades and new inventions that were often not only less costly but also more environmentally friendly for the environment were created, thus pollution actually shrank in the years following industrialization in many countries for cost-efficient reasons. It really isn't hard to see that 90-95% of all plastic in the ocean actually comes from India, China, and Africa, not the west, according to recent studies. 

Another reason why climate change is rejected by many is that Al Gore was the figurehead/poster boy politician of climate change. He's devoted to politics, not science. He even was an advocate of the faulty Kyoto Protocol as well. If the reality of climate change was first spread by scientists like Stephen Hawking rather than a bunch of crooked politicians, the science of climatology wouldn‚Äôt have been rejected so much. The problem with most people who accept the reality of climate change is that they try to prove it with graphs or charts that show rising temperatures over time. They show pictures of ice caps melting or records of sea levels rising. They seem to often mention that some percentage of scientists agree with them. Climate change skeptics are rightfully skeptical when people do this. These charts/graphs/pictures often fail to properly show the correlation between rising levels of CO2 emissions and temperatures ‚Äî correlation and causation are debatable in that case. Furthermore, to say that a percentage of scientists agree with you means you have to have a whole number, as math teaches us, to determine that percent, and there is no credible existing list of a whole number of climatologists on record to be able to make such claims. No one can take these things seriously. Once again, this is mostly the result of politicians trying to act like scientists. To deal with the situation of climate change, it is best that society accepts its legitimacy first. To do that, we need to distance ourselves from these politicians and teach the real science behind why climate change exists. Even if Al Gore presents accurate and scientific proof of climate change, he's still a politician and he doesn't care for the environment. I mean damn, just read about how much fossil fuels his mansion and private jets use. Don't use Al Gore as a single reference for Climate Change science, use actual scientists instead.",UC2LasgpBzNQeZYUqMD8WlBw,0.0,UgztBCPMZO4k93Pe9pB4AaABAg,jOKqYtRDGak,2018-12-03T00:00:06Z,climate crisis

It is good for life! This is pure crap. Fact is there hasn‚Äôt been any significant warming in 18 years. We are in an interglacial period within the Holocene epoch. Hence we are in a temperate period within an ice age. The warming that had been going on since the end of the Daulton minimum is ending. And on a larger scale weather for the most part has been favorable for life and plant growth. As many solar cycles and climate cycles reach their end as we move into solar cycle 25 which is starting now, a new grand solar minimum will be upon us plunging us into a new mini ice age which is why so many snowfall records and freezing temp records have been broken this year and why weather extremes have been abundant all over the world.

It would need to get well above 2,000 ppm or so to even start causing problems for non-plant life. The pitiful 300 or 500 ppm predicted would not even come close the levels seen at the time of the dinosaurs. Sure, it will get a little warmer and the storms might get a little stronger for a while until global temps equalize. 
The world‚Äôs bread baskets (the areas that produce food) will most likely move more toward the poles. Possibly turning Northern Siberia and parts of Canada into the next big bread baskets instead of the frozen waste lands they are today.... So things will change, but it will take hundreds of years, more than enough time for populations to move and for food production and industry to adapt.  Again, this end of the world scenarios (desertification drought and famine) being promoted is nothing but propaganda used by globalists to push their agenda..... Why would a world with the climate like that found during the Jurassic period be so bad? After all it did in fact produce the largest land animals and plants that ever lived.

Case in point‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Farmers who run greenhouses pump extra CO2 into their grow rooms to increase production. If it makes their plants produce more food what do you think will happen if all the plants of the entire world get the same treatment?  

With more CO2 comes more plants, with more plants comes more O2 and water vapor (AKA more rain ) and the % of N (nitrogen) in the air drops, the air gets thicker and we all breath better....

P.S. How do you verify that your mathematical model of future climate change and its affects are correct? You simply compare it to the last time CO2 levels really did reach the predicted levels‚Ä¶ And when did that last happen? During the Jurassic, Triassic, and Cretaceous periods, a time of unparalleled plant and animal growth.

And your conspiracy comment about Gore is just silly man. It threw out whatever credibility you had. CO2 is a pollutant, go to Eastern Asia where the...CO2...levels are causing intense smog. whoah. Now all this being said, if we lose an island or two, this is not tragic per se, but the unstabilization of our climate and seasons ARE. Present tense. Changes in seasonality is disproportionately affecting the lower classes of the global society who are contributing to greenhouse gas pollutants the least. Meanwhile the elite, yes that means Gore, need to admit that there is a global problem and actively live by their words. I'm not a huge fan of the word crisis, yet I believe that the U.S. specifically has enough power to make a shift towards cleaner, more efficient, and cheaper energy sources by forefronting the research, the political power, and subsequent funding to stray away from, to be frank, outdated and inefficient fossil fuel energy to make produce a sustainable future for our children.

It has really been proven that yes, climate change is a natural process that throughout geological periods the amount of CO2 has increased and decreased, warping the climate. But the reason why it's so alarming this time is because it is happening catastrophically faster than ever before, which begs the question, why is this time different? What could be causing such an impact on our atmosphere to speed climate change up so much? Of course humans are having the greatest impact on speeding the process through impacts Mr. Gore has said. 

The troposphere includes the surface of the earth, as it is the lowest layer of the atmosphere where almost all weather occurs. while the global mean temperature may look like small fluctuations, those little changes are actually major when it comes to processes in the environment. 

And the reason scientists act so harshly on outside ideas is because it's been PROVEN time and time again that this is happening, and we've spent decades trying to get people to see this but are taken as jokes and fear-mongers. Most ideas that counter climate change are paid for by those who have the biggest hand in exacerbating the problem. i will say that sometimes scientists have a hard time seeing outside their field, especially when it comes to solving the problem. So finding middle ground is very important. Some will say ""just change to 200% clean energy"" or ""stop using coal and cutting down rain forests"" without thinking of the people who rely on these industries for a living, instead of trying to understand the socioeconomic moves that must be taken with becoming more sustainable and ""reversing"" climate change impacts.

Why not just ban the production of new cars that use fossil fuels?

Why not fit these new neighbourhoods and skyscrapers being built with solar panels? 
Say that, by 2020 every newly built house/building will need to come with features to promote Eco-friendly lifestyle...

Having so many fruit and veg wrapped in plastic is just unnecessary.

It is good for life! This is pure crap. Fact is there hasn‚Äôt been any significant warming in 18 years. We are in an interglacial period within the Holocene epoch. Hence we are in a temperate period within an ice age. The warming that had been going on since the end of the Daulton minimum is ending. And on a larger scale weather for the most part has been favorable for life and plant growth. As many solar cycles and climate cycles reach their end as we move into solar cycle 25 which is starting now, a new grand solar minimum will be upon us plunging us into a new mini ice age which is why so many snowfall records and freezing temp records have been broken this year and why weather extremes have been abundant all over the world. The elite which includes Gore know this and are counting on many people not surviving. They are counting on your tax dollars to help them prepare and they are counting on your ignorance and lack of education on how climate  cycles work to keep their lie going as long as possible.

I'm also not 100% convinced that global warming is caused by humans, haven't their been piles and piles of geological studies that disprove the human influence and explain it due to the natural cycles the earth goes through over thousands of years? I'm not a geologist, nor do I know much about climate change, I believe it's important that we take better care of the earth but I am not 100% convinced it is man made, can someone tell me if I'm missing any important information?

For the record, I'm talking withing the confines of acadamia, I am not speaking in some conspiracy bubble that I made up in my head. I know many in the earth science department at my uni that say that it's not caused by humans. And I've also heard that some of the statistics often used to argue for man made climate change are false. I don't know enough about the specifics to know which statistics, but in some cases it has apparently happened.

Edit: for the record, I havent done much research on the subject, but I know most of you haven't either, this is why I am not rejecting or accepting a conclusion, because I simply do not know.

However, since the industrial revolution, we have seen massive increases in greenhouse gases. There is a proven historical link between C02 and temperature increases. C02 has never been as high as it is now in 800,000k+ years. This increase in GHGs stops long wave infrared light from leaving the atmosphere, warming oceans primarily. This fragile system is being altered drastically with human impact. There is absolute evidence that we are significantly altering climate change. Luckily, we don‚Äôt even have to believe that, because taking action almost always is cost effective. Driving a hybrid or electric car saves an average of $2500 per year on gas.

There are ways to look back though, that's just straight up true. We've taken ice cores at the poles, we've measured the long term patterns in earth's orbit around the sun, we have fossil records and geology for millions of years back. Yes the climate changes, but the average global temperature doesn't change by a degree Celsius in a single century. It took thousands of years to transition between the last ice age and today. There are real ways to measure and know about what happened in the past, just because nobody ever taught you about them doesn't mean they don't exist.

Ask for a free quote for solar on your house, again you can save a lot from this! Good luck!",UCes7W3l4s5rItNPl3BNYgRw,1.0,UgxdaBPaOBJ2xXzbcIl4AaABAg,jOKqYtRDGak,2018-12-03T00:00:06Z,climate crisis

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to ""fight"" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.

Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core

Period of Record
417,160 - 2,342 years BP

Methods
In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).

Trends
There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.

Those in the climate science denial community tend to look for information sources that reenforce their deeply entrenched worldview while they have been convinced that they have a duty and an obligation to reject all presented evidence that clashes with that view. Below are some linked articles that most viewers have never encountered, or which are rejected off-hand, by the vast majority of the earth's still rapidly growing human population of 7.7 billion people.

Most humans feel quite separate from all the other millions of species of life, including our closest animal cousins. Human hubris prevents most people from accepting the concept that there may be things we can't engineer our way out of. It is also hard for many to accept the concept that we may have long ago passed a threshold beyond which we we could turn things around. Hope springs eternal.

I've had plenty of Immortal victories without building a single one for other victory types. The idea is great if you take the politics out of it --I would have much preferred the game to have natural ice ages and warm periods rather than treat it solely like a human-made phenomenon, which is where the politics suffer--and similarly the moment you build 2-3 it feels like it's impossible to compensate for the water rise. Like even if I skip coal, and only do a few oil plants, the game has a ""runaway greenhouse effect"" feel to trying to get flood barriers up - you're always a turn too late. The slight productivity boost is generally not worth the amount of tiles lost in the game.

I've played Civilization from its first iteration.¬†Climate change was present in the game from the very start even from Civ 1. This iteration takes climate change to the next level although I am saddened to see unscientific things being taught to children who play this game. In the game, once CO2 is in the atmosphere it stays there forever.¬†There is no mention of a dynamical balance where CO2 is part of a cycle. The only way a player can remove CO2 is by carbon capture - which is a technology in the far future (and currently it does not seem like this technology will ever be feasible, in the game you're putting it back in a bottle). Conserving forests only helps in avoiding some of the penalties but it does not absorb CO2. Massive conservation and reforestation should. The game has the mechanics in place for it and this is more realistic. There is no CO2 penalty for bulldozing rainforests or clear cutting trees! Instead of presenting a magic pill option of carbon capture in a bottle, maybe kids need to learn about¬†the importance of forests and other ecosystems and their conservation. A few national parks on a few tiles  won't do it, this game could show all the data about forest and rainforest loss! Also if we're talking hypotheticals, the game could have included seeding the oceans with iron to simulate phytoplankton to absorb CO2 or seeding the upper atmosphere with sulphur for atmospheric dimming - as these are available now (although might have adverse effects of their own). The game also trashes nuclear plants are as once you build them they are a nightmare to upkeep and will inevitably blow up and pollute. The truth is nuclear is the only good option we have for the foreseeable future and it is possible to do it right (France). Yet the game shows wind and solar as the perfect solutions, you just install some in a tile and millions of people and their industry have enough energy in abundance. Unfortunately it does not work this way in real life ... I can recommend this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w¬†

My final gripe with Civ6 gathering storm has less to do with climate and more about data: I always enjoyed all the data Civ games presented, all the ways you could order data find your most productive cities, your cities with most culture, etc, it was a fun way for a kid to learn to extract information from a lot of data, there were charts, graphs etc. In this new iteration? Not so much. You want to teach kids about climate change, ok. They have 3 power generation from coal and 2 oil used for fuel - why can't they just follow the links to find where? Why is there no data table showing the worst polluting cities and units? Why can't I see all the forest loss that occurred? It could even teach about the CO2 cycle - emitters and absorbers and show how the balance is broken. Data, exploring data was a key educational element in the game that is sorely missing now. All we have is the magic bottle that holds carbon and of course the giant death robot that can wade in the ocean.

I'm a geography teacher among other things and I'm glad to see other dimensions being explored in the Civilization games - things like religion were a really nice addition to Civilization IV, for instance. However, I'm always conscious with these things that game designers have to balance realism with fun and gameplay. Civ is already a very complicated game - I've only just got VI having skipped V (I own it, but I just didn't get into it) and I'm enjoying it, but there's a huge amount to learn even having sunk many hours into previous titles. (With IV, I never really did get the hang of the espionage mechanic even after such a lot of time spent with the game.) There comes a point where you have to make a game that works, and the more you add to it the more things there are to go wrong (and Civ's AI, while serviceable, isn't spectacular). Then there's also the fact that no one likes being penalised. Losing resources or whole cities isn't fun. Yes, it's realistic, and losing cities is part of the game, but unlike losing one in war to an enemy, losing one to climate change is completely outside of your control: there's nothing you can do to stop it, it's nothing to do with your skill. 


I can see myself playing a game and being pissed off when there's sea level rise and I lose some cities and could possibly lose the entire game, after several hours have been sunk into it.

Well, I'd like to point out to you that you say it's up for debate, but in the civ game itself you said that there are carbon emissions released when we gather and refine the fuel. A question I have is that, in our future, when electric motors are used for such things, wouldn't the large amount of power generated from Nuclear work in favor of this, and therefore eventually pass that off? There's also the issue of solar panels requiring a lot of carbon parts in it that you cannot get around releasing even more carbon that for nuclear, not to mention the toxic chemical pollution into the ground when solar panels break, which is frequents due to overheating and outside forces not controllable. Not to mention they're unreliable, and their very low power generation, also the shear amount of land taken up. I could understand wind (something that still takes up a lot of land, generates a lot of noise, and requires a lot of materials.), or definitely water as an energy source, but not solar.

I woudnt think higher CO2 concentrations would have much effect on C3 plants but the source i used is from 1995 so i should probably check on something more recent.

I deleted my original comment about ocean acidification after i wrote it because it had very little to do with the original topic but it seems i was too slow and you managed to read it so ill adress that. I have no clue were on earth the ph of water could possibly oscillate by 4 through seasons nor how, but on average the ph of oceans (and lakes and rivers in a lesser degree) has been steadly decreasing as Co2 concentrations increases, this decrease in ph varies by region (the closest to river sources the smaller should be the decrease in ph) but on average is decreasing relatively fast. If i recall correctly below a ph of 7.8 it becomes impossible for organisms to fix calcium into their shells and they just dissolve . Its a common lab experiment to evaluate shell growth rate under different ph levels and there should be plenty of videos about it. Remember ph is logarithmic in nature and as such a very small change in its value can mean a very big difference in acidity (or alkalinity in this case).

San Carlos de Bariloche its in the province of Rio Negro, Argentina. Here in south Argentina there is a dry season during summer and a rainy season during winter, the snow that accumulates on the Andes mountains during winter melts and feeds the rivers during the dry summers sustaining the Andinos forests, by the time the snow is depleted the next winter arrives and the cicle repeats. But each year summer gets a little hotter, and rivers run out of water a couple of days earlier each time. Little by little different forests suddenly die as water runs out too early. This forests have evolved under this cicle and more rain wont be able to sustain them (rain rarely manages to reach past the mountain range). I know this is just a single anecdotal account of the effect of global warming on one single region of the world, but its were i live and were i¬¥ve grown so i thought i might as well share it.

There are many systems of positive feedback and negative feedback  involved in the CO2 cicle, climate change is a complex subject that shouldn¬¥t be trivialized,  yet because in countries like USA it has became a powerful political tool there is a lot of misinformation going around (both trying to minimize and inflate the subject). I wish the matter could be dealt with like the world dealt with the hole in the ozone layer, by addressing the problem and implementing viable solutions (i mention viable because many of the solutions i¬¥ve heard for dealing with global warming are just impossible to implement or completely noneffective in solving the issue).

I get my date for this from here. https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3004. It's behind a paywall I know, but the conclusion is 14% greening in 30 years of which 70% attributable to an increase in CO2. Extrapolate those findings to the beginning of industrialization and we greened the Earth by about 25% only because of CO2. 

The carbon uptake of plants depends a lot on the CO2 concentration. More of it means it goes in quicker and they can be closed longer (meaning less water loss through the stomata). That's why the best greening is in arid areas, instead of desertification you have regreening of deserts (barring land overuse)

As for ocean acidification, it's totally fine. A station in Hawaii measured -0.04 pH since 1991. If you take into account that seasonal swings in some places are as much as 4 pH it looks to me like a whole lot nonsense that it's somehow a threat. And you do know it's calcium carbonate that calcifying species are using for their shells? More of that stuff just means it's easier for them to make shells. 

As for your forest, is that in California? Yeah I know California experienced drought, but more drought is not the worldwide trend. It seems highly anekdotal like the last summer was dry in the Netherlands. The worst drought in the US was the dust bowl and that's long ago. And you do know that higher temperatures also increase precipitation right? Well there's the offset of the more evaporation part for you. Not that the IPCC projections seem likely to me anyway because even though I acknowledge that CO2 warms the Earth I don't believe in the positive feedback that they work in their models to make the warming dangerous. Because if Earth's climate worked on a net positive feedback to warming life would be fried long before we came around, a net negative feedback therefore seems much more likely to me and a mild warming.",UCMDhT55rcS70CSg9jnGzWwA,1.0,Ugx2o3XPGH1seELkd3p4AaABAg,gPVBDCDmrcU,2019-02-14T05:06:38Z,climate crisis

Also, the biggest factor that determinates CO2 intake by plants its not CO2 concentration in the air but rather how much the plant¬¥s stomata remains open per day. Higher temperatures causes the stomata to remain closed for longer periods of time in order to preserve water which results in a smaller CO2 intake, and as such global warming has a negative impact in crop yield on average.

Anyway global warming is kind of a touchy subject for me. The city i live in, my hometown, has many ancient forests that are dependent on the rivers that come down from the mountains in order survive. Because the increase in temperature in the last decades many of this rivers now run out of water by the end of summer which has caused many of this beautiful forests to suddenly die out in a single season out of lack of water.

Some of it is, but other parts are staying exactly the same while others are getting hotter or colder. North America is the perfect example. The west and south of the continent are getting much warmer, but the central, eastern and northern parts are getting colder. That's because most of North America is still going through climate change regarding coming out of the last Ice Age that covered most of North America. You can't call those people idiots when they are saying global warming, because in of itself global warming is an idiotic term that only uneducated people use. It is climate change, and most of the effects of what we're seeing will not last more than a hundred years in most places, doubtingly a generation, and then they will change again.

*This is a long comment, but a very important one and I beg that you read it if you are interested in environmental economics and politics.*

 The Chinese contribution to pollution is, to a certain extent, also caused by the western society. Because of China's massive industry and labour market(and also less green regulation) this has made producing good in china extremely cheap therefore a shit ton of goods are produced there for different western companies such as Apple, Nikon, Adidas, Armani etc. Us, Europeans, are exploiting china's lower costs to produce goods so that we can make more profit, grow the economy, encourage innovation and research and reduce the unemployment rate, HOWEVER, at the cost of pollution. China isn't the only country to blame here, considering that we literally benefit from the pollution that we pay them to make so that we can produce goods cheaper . Let's say for example if you work at, any of those companies I mentioned above, than chances are that you have that job because the company can afford to employ you with the money from lowering the costs. Now wouldn't it be nice if China implement the same green laws as the Europeans? Sure it would be nice for the environment but that would cause a MASSIVE, multiple trillion economical crisis that will put our civilisation decades behind and we won't be able to fund new green technology, build new green energy facilities or recycling facilities(also millions of people will lose their jobs, the suicide rate will increase, radical ideologies will become more popular, war and racism support will increase). 

Now, we don't know what is better, reducing pollution at the expense of damaging our economies, or keep polluting whilst keeping our economies stable with the hope of slowly reducing pollution by funding research with that money so that we can MAYBE in the long-term find new ways to produce goods and electricity at a more efficient and less polluting rate. The European Commission currently leans more towards the second option, as in the Paris Agreement they basically allowed China to pollute, as long as they promise that they will do anything to reduce it in the long-run, also giving them a guide-line(a road-map) for the future. It was something like, by 2030 you should be aiming at reducing pollution by 50%. This is actually the reason why Donald Trump's administration left the Paris Agreement, because they claim they don't trust that China will reduce pollution, and claim that they will just do anything to become more powerful(which in my opinion, is understandable because of Game Theory, Prisoner's Dilemma, which if you want, you can do more research on)


I hope that this made you understand the situation better. It isn't always as simple as ""Fuck China, look at the statistics, they are causing it!"".

I understand why they went for such a toned down version, since rng in strategy games isn't usually something people are thrilled about, but I'd love more in this case. 

Let lakes and oasis's dry up over time. Let's  have more tiles flood on the coasts, and up coastal rivers, and let's have people not know when those tiles are going to flood until they unlock that as part of  some technology in like the medieval era or later. 

Let's make storms more deadly and more frequent, and have droughts last longer. I want a system of climate change that people will really want to avoid getting to those later stages because it will just ruin everyone's plans to some extent, possibly even forcing allies to fight one another for resources, or to prevent an ally from spilling so much co2 into the air.

Hell, if we could turn snow tiles into  tundra,  grassland into plains, plains into desert etc, that would also be amazingly brutal punishment for hitting those highest tiers of co2 emission (though that one might be a bad idea, considering the AI is too stupid to ever avoid hitting that point).

______________________________________________________________________

Maybe it's just from the small overview given here, but i feel like modern industrialisation is way to high up in the focus of this expansion ... I'm neither highly educated in climate science nor paleontology nor how intense the is influence of human activity is on a macro or micro scope. I get that they want to bring some awareness to the player and I like that a lot ... it just doesn't seems to me that the sentence ""it punish the player"" really sticks ... for me it looks more like another mechanic to screw other player and make it a battle royal RTS (which is technically right I guess).

Anyway my point is, that from my knowledge that there are multiple cases where human civilization had devastating influence on the ecology of the world around them, like why did the bronze age dropped out of fashion or documentations of Romans mentioning the decline of nature in cultivated areas ... or Easter Islands. 

Destroying grown nature around is what makes human influence painful for the people more locally to the damage ... and this punish you first or alone for being  irresponsible and work natural resources to the ground.

Only with the industrialsation we come to the point where the actions of one part of the world can influence the planet as a whole ... but as we see in reality sadly/luckly not always where it's done, but mostly where it's already hard to come by ... for one or another reason.

Also what isn't shown in this video is how the player can deal with this ... is there even a way? Or is it meant to happen? Renaturation? Reforestation? nature-sanctuaries? 

What about Human healthcare? This was something that always limited population to accumulate in a single area and was highly effected by pollution and industrialsation. 

Another thing I miss is ""natural"" change of climate ... what about Ice-Ages? We have something like this in Endless Legend (maybe I bit to rough but it's something).

Personally my favorite Civ was ""Call to Power: Civilization II"" As it already added a lot of problems with Pollution and devastation, but also a lot of possibilities to deal with it. It's probably not fleshed out in a global aspect, but from the core it looks more punishing as just making the world smaller for everybody.",UCQCegJ5uxMdQm5bZejcbdWw,0.0,UgxuLEPjW3Jbpc5sjfF4AaABAg,gPVBDCDmrcU,2019-02-14T05:06:38Z,climate crisis

The thing that happened to Venus is labelled ""rampant greenhouse effects"" and it is something that could happen to Earth if we are not careful.

It is the miniscule bacteria and algea life that are the main producers of oxygen on our planet. Guess where their main habitat is.

It's the ocean.

If the ocean turns too acidic, these lifeforms will start dying. They are extremely weak to temperature and chemical changes in the ocean.

Regarding the ocean level. There is set amount of water on the planet. There is a limit to how high the oceans can rise over a set amount of time. The current given projections for the end of this century are at 2.3-4 meters. 

In theory it could go up to 53m over the next 2000 years or so but that is exceedingly unlikely to occur faster than that. And due to temperature shifts and atmospheric changes it is unlikely that it would reach that level to begin with. By that point oceans would already be pretty close to boiling due to the incredible rise in temperature (minimum of 22¬∞C increase)

Granted it was rather limited in its scope, only dealing with dropping fertility levels, and snow fall each year moving further and further south (this being a detriment to any army that doesn't have the no snow attrition ability.) I would say one game that did climate change really well as an in game mechanic is Endless Legend, which is basically a fantasy civ game... Winters get longer and longer, and cause more and more debuffs on your faction. If your game lasts long enough winters will eventually become ""endless"" since they will take so many turns to end.

Granted, the player doesn't contribute to this in any way, there is no co2 emissions or player interaction with how or when climate change effects start to take place. And there is no way for the player to really curb it, only survive it. I would say Civ 6 definitly did it better... which it better have, it is 5 years younger!

If you're interested in getting a better understanding, and don't mind a little bit of reading, I'd advise having a skim of the official summary reports by the IPCC (setting aside an hour will be enough to make you more knolwedgable than 95% of internet dwellers!!!). You'll immediately notice that the language is far more measured than soundbites from TV, reflecting peer review by dozens of different authors. I think a key part of this is recognising that there's a big difference in future scenarios, e.g. 1.5 degrees of warming vs. 3 degrees and how long this takes to occur, as well as recognising the limitations of thier forecasting methodology.  As far back as I'm aware, the IPCC have been highly consistent in their findings as opposed to 'moving the goalposts'. 

Latest full published report:  https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/
Latest chapter on potential impacts:  https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter3_Low_Res.pdf

All that said, my understanding is that a 'marginal increase in bad weather' is an understatement. The biggest impacts for humans aren't day-to-day variations in temperature and rainfall, but that extreme events such as floods, droughts and hurricanes become more frequent and more severe. So what was previously 'the worst storm in one hundred years' now occurs every ten years, for example. Also worth bearing in mind that Western countries such as the US can probably deal with slightly more regular and severe natural distasters, both through investing in preparation and crisis response. It's very different for second and third world countries where property insurance and emergency healthcare aren't available :( :( :(",UCguG9P96eDycOtMUVpjKW2w,1.0,UgyZIoKMZt9ZJfGy8zZ4AaABAg,gPVBDCDmrcU,2019-02-14T05:06:38Z,climate crisis

About the safety and ""green-ness"" of Nuke plants. I agree that classical Uranium plants do terribly on both accounts. But look up Molten Salt Reactors and Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor. Both of which the Indians and Chinese are sinking TENS OF BILLIONS of dollars into R&D. Why? Because the designs are physically incapable of meltdown. By ""physically"" I mean that their very nature and the nature of the type of fission fuel they use make them unable of meltdown. In the late 1960s, Oak Ridge National Labs run a LFTR reactor, they deactivated ALL OF ITS SAFETY FEATURES for a safety test and then overclocked its output a hundred types, and the Reactor, ON ITS OWN, safely shut down without any need for Human control.

I do not see the solution to this being limiting our technology as poorer nations will continue using fossile fuels. Spending our climate budget on stopping the spread of the deserts and planting a extremly large amount of trees(and other vegetation) in the dry regions will see more immediate results.

This would also have a global positive effect on the enviroment even if nations like india and china continue wont stop using fossile fuels. 

I am not a climate denier however this is not an issue that can be seen from only a enviromental lens. A restriction in fossile fuels and atomics will worsen the western worlds position geopolitically and geostrategically.

The heads of these working groups then summarise their findings into the summary for policy makers. That summary then goes through another round of review based on comments from governments (which invariably tends to make the reports too conservative in their conclusions) before going through a final review by scientists to make sure nothing in the final document is misleading or incorrect.

Very interesting question, and that depends on a lot of things, but arguably the most important factor would be whether or not modern capitalism also existed. In a market economy owned by those that own large amounts of land and wealth, it might not be likely that those powerful wealthy individuals would slow down on production, as that is needed to dominate a marketplace. Communal ownership, on the other-hand, incentivizes more thoughtful allocations of resources, and to consider long-term non-market consequences.",UC1V85OqPd3zUmQ3EWneemUQ,0.0,Ugypcjd9DcMyUoJ4Z714AaABAg,gPVBDCDmrcU,2019-02-14T05:06:38Z,climate crisis

If you haven't figured out yet that's it's human nature that's at the core here, there is no helping you.
A simple example, Africa contributed nothing to the increase of CO2, *and it shows*, we are the poorest, weakest among the nations of the world.
If they knew the consequences of the industrial revolution THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME.
Because those who didn't got crushed by those who did, at its core it's the problem of the game of human survival:

Additionally there are several problems with authoritarianism, forced Kurdification and recuitment of minors into the armed forces. 
My point is greater than greed alone humans are always flawed some more than others and that will upset any system which requires perfection, greed was just an example. 
Besides mutual values are nebulous and subjective and could easily lead to divisions which in turn lead to further conflict and exploitation.
I do empathize with your idealism however I do wish humans would put aside selfish and/or misguided desires and human conflict in order to truly advance ourselves as a species but I know it won't happen.

Two current examples that exist today are Mondragon (workers co-op in Spain) and Rojava (Kurdish democratic union in the mid-east which beat ISIS). Smaller examples exist, but essentually: I don't see a strong precedent for ""greed"" as the sole operator for human nature either; most failures of democratic distributive systems tend to come primarily from outside interference (The US installing dictators in previously-democratic countries for instance.)  
  
I'm not going to say ""humanity is naturally always mutalistic"" either though, since human nature is more complex than that as well.

Fuel can also be reprocessed from certain reactors to make more fuel of different grades and there are other methods of nuclear power generation out there but generally speak, it relies on mined minerals. Not-in-my-back-yard (NIMBY) is definitely a stance a lot of anti-nuclear folk take but there are other issues with nuclear power which are more to do with technical aspects. 

When Simon says 'Depending on how you measure it' I believe he's referring to what you count when considering the impacts of a system.

As I mentioned in my first post the climate has not demonstrated heating since the late 90s even though 1/3 of the human carbon footprint has happened in the last 20 or so years, if global warming was linked directly to Co2 we would have seen a curve of ever increasing heating.

He has NO money to make, NO ax to grind0 he just can't STAND the fact that we're all being lied to and scared to death by unscrupulous people.  Tony's breadth of experience is quite unique and extremely well suited for what he is doing. Secondarily, the earth has been ice free several times that we know of.  I think Tony was talking about how the Jakobshavn glacier grew like 30 miles by 1975 when we were worried about global cooling.  You'll have to check me on that. We are also still still warming from the last ice age.  Glacier national park has quietly removed all the signs they had up, inside that contained all the dire predictions. Predictions of no ice have been going on for 100 years.  Every single one of them were wrong.  Unless you watch many of Tony's videos, (not just his beautiful outdoor videos), you won't get it.  Also, his long time close friend was Dr. Bill Grey, passed now, who was the preeminent climatologist of his time.  He was the man who was most responsible for developing the methodology for predicting cyclones.  Dr. Grey (Gray)?, was invited by Al Gore, to see his bullsht movie.  Dr. Grey politely told him that he was happy to attend but did not agree with Gore's C02 theory.  Gore revoked his funding.  Gore also revoked Dr. Happer's funding.  Dr. Willie Soon just left and gave up because he knew he was surrounded by bought off liars and hacks.  No catastrophic predictions about global warming?  No funding.  It's disgusting.  Dr. Patrick Moore's story is very interesting- he's an ecologist / environmentalist with a PHD in ecology.  His breadth of knowledge is also quite amazing.  He knows about ecology, history, geology, climate, just about everything about animals and botany and even exactly how power sources work.  These men are a treasure trove of truth with no ax to grind- most of the people predicting all this catastrophic baloney are either being paid by govt, highly incompetent or have much to gain from, (or recoup bad investments into), green energy.  Green energy is a good idea but it's not even CLOSE to being #1 ecologically sound- ALL of the green power sources pollute horribly,  #2 have just horrendous consequences- the number of birds, particularly raptors, who are killed by wind turbines cannot be overstated.  It's REALLY bad- the numbers are VERY high.  And #3, these sources CANNOT reliably power anything more than homes and other light use power needs. Because of our Gov here in CA, we are having power shortages..  he made it mandatory to use ""renewables"" and it not only costs A LOT more, it provides less. And we've had another relatively mild summer here in CA. And, C02 behaves in a logarithmic manner with heat so, let's say 200ppm raises the temperature .1 degrees. You'll need 400 to make it .2, 800 to make it .3, 1600 to make it .4.  Greater concentrations of C02 also make plants use water more efficiently.  The chance of humans raising the C02 level high enough to be a detriment in 1,000 years is likely zero because in a few hundred years, we'll be using other methodologies and they will be FAR more efficient.  LASTLY, there IS NO OVER POPULATION.  At the base of most of this climate hysteria is this idea that there are too many people.  There aren't.  We take up less than 9% of the landmass, which is about 28% of the earth.  The rest is water. Oh and, there IS NO water shortage.  8-)",UCqzVvtbrEpDenAHT4EYp2fA,1.0,UgxT-xNdgQjac6dbudd4AaABAg,AV2DvfWKyC0,2018-01-29T09:30:01Z,climate crisis

And after 1979 the rate of decrease is extremely fast. And it‚Äôs getting faster and the surface area of the ice is at its lowest point in history.

 ""Fan"" - short for ""fanatic""   Fanatic definition: ""a person filled with excessive and single-minded zeal, *especially for an extreme religious or political cause* .""

A scientific  mind abhors fanaticism, it is the antithesis of reason.    

Mediocrity and socialism are the handmaidens of cultural decline; government scientists, as their fellow welfare recipients,  are contented with a their steady paychecks and their promise of lifetime employment for doing nothing.   A ""climate scientist""  will never win a Nobel for this very reason:  nothing useful results from their ""work""

Measuring ""things"" and endlessly clanging the alarm bell over short term variations,  ever present in nature, is not science; it's nothing other than a clamor for more ""funding"" and more ""careerism,"" the bane of progress. 


RE: ""America is losing the lead in tech to China""    


Nonsense, China does not innovate, their language and their culture is not appropriate for it; they copy and mass produce using cheap labor.   While the socialists force unworkable ""green energy"" solutions for non-existent problems on us, they will be on hand to sell it to the fools cheaper than anyone else.

China is still building coal plants at a breakneck pace (more than one a week) in order to power windmill and solar factories to sell to socialist governments in their effort to convince the idiots that they can predict and even change weather patterns.   Such gullibility is truly alarming.

I was planning on a little ironic answer, but let's be polite. You have probably heard that meteorologists have used satellites for some time to measure high and low pressures, temperature, wind-speed and direction?. The first weather satellite, Vanguard 2, was launched on February 17, 1959. Of course capabilities have improved greatly since then. The first satellite with high-resolution FTIR spectroscopy capabilites was launched in 1998. FTIR Spectroscopy has the capability to see how much heat the different greenhouse gases radiates back into space. Water vapor is the winner, but we can't do much with that as it is linked to the temperature of oceans and athmosphere. CO2 comes in on a good second place, and that we can do something about.

This means your education was 'successful.' 

Greenland is not ""melting""  In fact it accumulates far more ice annually than its land surface can support.  The result is that the mountains of ice accumulate in the center of Greenland continue to grow until a dynamic equilibrium is established between plasticized glacial ice pancaking outwards until there is no more land to support the mass.   This ice either falls into a warmer sea and melts near the shore or is ripped away by sea currents to melt elsewhere.    

This flow rate is not uniform since the time it takes for glacial ice to pancake out from the center of the land mass to the shore is measured in many centuries and governed by glaciation rates that occurred long ago.    

To the best guess that current measurement techniques offer (and they are guesses)  Greenland put on a little additional ice (only a few hundred billion tons)  in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018  ice seasons and is on track to lose an equally tiny bit of ice in the 2018-2019 Ice season.    This is 'weather' not 'climate'     

These swindlers only want to take you money and they assume you are too stupid to understand any of this; in your case, they have guessed correctly,    Don't feel insulted if you are young, you have been trained to become stupid in your schools.

I was hopeful he could convince me of what I'm seeing go down is not going down but he doesn't...its the same thing I hear from other climate change debunked.  I've been at this a decade now.  It's become clear what our pollution is doing to the earth that includes co2.  If things suddenly change and the earth stops heating and the  consequences that go away then good.  I'll breath a sigh of relief and be thankful I was wrong.  Each year I see the deal going down more and more.  2012 the climate shifted gears and I've been watching to see if it will shift back or go further in the destructive direction.

It is really absurd.  The temps you are talking are already existing in the tropics and equatorial regions of the planet and those regions flourish.  And none of the green house gases you worry about are anything new.  And if all the land based ice were to melt it would take OVER 5000 years for Greenland and much much longer for Antarctica.

Let me just add that the glaciers in Greenland are slower in the center of the island because it's 3 to 4 Kms deep.
Even so, there's one, sorry can't remember the name, close to the Atlantic Ocean. It's the fastest in the World moving at 15 Kms (9 or 10 miles) per year. Usually the speed is counted in a few meters per year  15,000 meters is not a few . It's a hell of a lot. 
About the permafrost melting, , people in general are oblivious of the immense danger, no smaller than the Methane amounts still contained  underground or under the seabed of the Artic Ocean. The shallowest Ocean in the World.
To show you how vulnerable it is, I watched the true story of a small village in Alaska where you had a dirt road to get there or go on to the Oil Riggs. 
There were dozens of houses built along the road which they decided to make faster. Molten snow and dirt became mud. To kill these two birds with one stone, they paved the road with tarmac. Coincidentally it's black. So it started absorbing a lot of heat, which was transferred to the surrounding area. BTW it was permafrost. It didn't take long for the houses to tilt, start sinking, opening cracks everywhere and they became useless . Tens of houses destroyed by a one lane road after it was covered in tarmac. That strip of black retained  enough heat to evacuate a small town. Now picture this mistake in the middle of a town with a few thousand people.
This goes to show you how sensitive to hotter temperatures the permafrost is and if it goes, the feces of the underground bacteria will be released in the atmosphere. Those feces are METHANE GAS (or Natural Gas) .",UCWH0K4Rn0itwkWte97VUDVQ,1.0,Ugz8lcMT7CdJUtqcuKd4AaABAg,AV2DvfWKyC0,2018-01-29T09:30:01Z,climate crisis

Out of curiosity, have you tried freezing some salt water (table salt will do) . You'll need a 3 or 4 degrees colder freezer.
Once solid, plunge them. In a luke warm glass of water. The same you used to make the salty cnes of ice. Tap water.

Fresh water dilates when it freezes but salt water will shrink its volume just like everything else. Cold, things shrink and lose volume.
Heat will dilate or increase the volume. 

Once you have the ice cubes with salt, inside the glass draw a mark on the level of the water. Compare to the level after the ice is gone. 
Do it in a small scale or you'll never end the experiment.
Remember the icebergs in the Artic Ocean are mostly salt water. The Artic is an Ocean. It has no land under it except the seabed.
Greenland and the Antarctic are masses of land. Most of it is above sea level, but some of it is covered by layers of ice 2,  3 miles deep. The land in those places has been pushed down below the sea level but it doesn't matter.

Greenland Gains Massive Amounts Of Ice Second Year In A Row
https://climatechangedispatch.com/greenland-gains-massive-amounts-of-ice-second-year-in-a-row/
Summer is over, and Greenland‚Äôs surface has gained 510 billion tons of ice over the past year ‚Äì about 40% above normal.  The surface mass budget is snow/ice accumulation minus melt.

How Geologic Forces are Melting Southern Greenland Ice Sheet
http://www.plateclimatology.com/how-geologic-forces-are-melting-southern-greenland-ice-sheet
That‚Äôs because southern Greenland‚Äôs surface ice melt is more likely caused by natural, geologically induced heat flow from one of Earth‚Äôs largest Deep Ocean crustal plate junctures, the 10,000 mile long Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). 
Proof supporting this phenomenon is compelling and reliable, because it‚Äôs happened before. The well-documented 2009-2010 southern Greenland Ocean ‚Äúwarm cell‚Äù (Figure 2) occurred for the same length of time, had a limited geographical location, and persisted as long as the 2009-2010 southern Greenland surface ice melting. Secondly, the ongoing 2016 surface ice melting, or the southern Greenland Omega Block, is also associated with a rapidly building southern Greenland Ocean warm cell as per shallow sea surface (SST) anomaly maps. This latest Omega Block, or high-pressure system, is occurring in the same exact limited geographical location as the 2009-2010 event. The awesome power and far-reaching influence of the 2009-2010 southern Greenland Ocean warm cell is famous for another reason, it caused the 2010 Gulf Stream ‚ÄúShutdown‚Äù as described in a previous Climate Change Dispatch article (here).

Luxembourg, Belgium, Singapore, Kuwait, Bahrain, the Netherland Antilles, U.A.E., Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, and Australia for example have higher emissions per capita than America. Also, most of Europe is above the global average for CO2 emissions, and hasn't made much, if any progress since the Paris climate agreement. Even China's CO2 emissions per capita are lower than almost every European country. Furthermore, you are comparing dense countries where travel is short, and renewables are more feasible on a national scale to the third largest country in the world both in land coverage and population (the United States is the size of Europe but half the population). The space between cities aren't as dense, making walking or biking unfeasible for anyone outside the inner city, the space between cities is greater, meaning high-speed railways and public transport isn't as feasible nor practical, meaning cars take their place. However, electric cars are too expensive for most people (Europe included), so guess what. People are forced to use hydrocarbon fueled cars. So no matter what, that won't change unless electric cars become cheaper than regular cars or unless the U.S. government relocates everyone into denser patches. 

Renewables aren't as practical either, as they are less efficient in less dense regions. Also, when it comes to solar (the cleanest renewable and the highest potential renewable in that it can be implemented in most areas efficiently) we have no way of storing the energy.

When it comes to wind power, it also has it's downfalls. The wind is strongest late at night and early in the morning on average, but energy demand is highest between 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and peaks at 6 p.m., when wind is weaker. Meaning you once again have to store energy created at night. Wind power is also limited in where it can be implemented, many of the areas it can be implemented aren't highly populated. 

When it comes to thermal energy, it is consistent, but it can only be implemented in an extremely select number of areas. Only 3 are considerably populated, these being Western California, the Pacific Northwest, and Anchorage.

Hydropower has high potential; however, there are very few places left in the U.S. where hydropower station and dams can be built and supply considerable energy. So it is basically limited in it's extent. It also causes it's own damages. This being large amounts of methane production (artificial lakes are one of the largest producers of methane today), CO2 production (the Hoover dam produced roughly 6,600,000 tons of CO2 during it's construction, even more sense then), they flood massive amounts of land, reduce the silt in water, harm species (dams in China have been one of the largest causes of extinction in China, and dams in the west have threatened native fish soecies greatly), and after some time silt renders dams useless.",UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA,1.0,Ugx7GmkDNlsM-HJeS5R4AaABAg,AV2DvfWKyC0,2018-01-29T09:30:01Z,climate crisis

Spock started out as a superior being but as the exploration wore on he ended up very maimed by his lack of emotions. This was not a planned thing but a place driven by trying to write for that charector. You will notice that when they redid the show they had the anti-Spock as Data. Rather than having enotions  and trying not to, Data does not have emotions but seeks them out. Lor his ""brother"" also lacks emotions and sees them as a weakness. All this of course is ""literature"" but the writers actually struggle and discuss this in the episodes and beyond and that is a big part of why they are so classical.

In point of fact there are people who have brain damage and lose all emotions, and they are indeed extremely disabled as the foundation of every action starts with emotions, even if logic helps with specifics in achieving the goal it is emotions that set every goal.

Empathy of course is another matter of discovering in yourself how others would feel in a circumstance. The ripping babies out of their mothers arms never to be seen again is a perfect example of a total lack of empathy, added to the lack of understanding of almost everyone else who had the slightest amount of empathy would also react.

Likewise Mosquitoes and their  diseases also spread so that too is already a problem.

Add to that the melting of ice caps to just glaciers (already well documented and just normal dry seasons that today depend on Glacier melt will no longer have that and  with total warming the wet and dry cycles become more extreme. Many glaciers even now are disappearing and when gone the rivers will suddenly just stop flowing when the last of the ice was used up the year before.

So when you take the carbon from fossil beds it is not going back to fossil beds so more is obove ground. Some may dissolve into the oceans making them more acid, for a time and some will go into plants, but all that is dynamic and untill it is permenantly sequestered underground again it will remain in the system. This is as true as a lump of coal burned 100 or more years ago as the gas in your car burned today. Every pound is piled on every other pound so if we stopped every ounce that was mined, the total circulating would not change. However as long as the energyout is less than the energy in the heating of the CO2 already here will continue: however as Methane bound by cold reaches a critical tempreture  it all becomes a gas father quickly and that absorbs much more heat and the total will spike the heat even more. Eventually the methane becomes  CO2 and carbon gets sequestered again but the planet will have a new range of species with humans not among them.

The Vikings had converted to Christianity even before founding Iceland, and it was years after that  when they arrived in Greenland, and still a couple of generations lived in Greenland before the weather got cold enough to not grow enough to feed the animals and unwilling to eat the food that frolicked at their feet, they begged God to save them and built the largest building they ever built as an offering to stop the cold, and became even more devout and resistant to violating those rules and more resistant to interactions with the Inuit, and even after the women and children were buried archeologists found the last of them where they died alone in their farm houses getting every last scrap of what they were eating to the point even the flies could find little to feed on.",UCRbYSDON2LYKFmphMVQlELw,1.0,UgzZPB4nAemWZ0EVrkl4AaABAg,AV2DvfWKyC0,2018-01-29T09:30:01Z,climate crisis

The Earth is NOT in a CO2 ""drought"" as far as human habitat is concerned.  We EVOLVED in a warm period of an Ice age, a warm interglacial.  WE turned it into a HOT interglacial.  We NEED the cool temps as do our food animals and food crops.  We NEED CO2 concentrations to be under 320 ppme to have a shot at long term survival.  Yeah, lots of CO2 made things much hotter in the Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, etc...... which is fine for dinosaurs, but a bad deal for mammals which need to thermoregulate.  Humans die in wet bulb temps. of 35C. after a day or two.  Our crops suffer too, from heat induced stress, losing protein and micronutrient content as well as reduced yield.  Then there is the increase in diseases, reduction of pollinators, spread of insect pests an the diseases they transport.  Heating due to excessive CO2 is killing the habitat humans rely on.  Other human activities are poisoning the habitat with plastics, nucleides, chemicals, hormones, and altering river flows, reducing organic inputs into fisheries, resulting in fishery collapse and closing.  It isn't helped by an acidifying ocean, heating ocean, spreading of ""dead zones"" around the world, where the very toxic H2S is created.

Many contend that the stable climate period ALLOWED humans to develop the technology to farm instead of continuing the hunter-gatherer life.  
I think there has been a feedback from human activities since the end of the last glacial period, about 11-12 thousand years, which is what stabilized the climate.   Humans may well have altered the climate for this whole period.  Industrial activity, which is generally considered to have existed since 1750, has vastly increased the scale and shortened the time that it takes for profound changes in climate and habitat to affect the biosphere.  CO2 and atmospheric particulates and aerosols increased enormously during the build up for WW2.  The war also released a lot of smoke and particulates.  Post-war rebuilding and industrialization pumped a lot of this stuff into the atmosphere.  The rapid increase in temperatures (GAST) began in the mid 1970s as clean air acts world wide began to attenuate the release of atmosphere-altering gases, particulates and aerosols.  The ""aerosol parasol"" has been keeping the biosphere from heating as much as it would otherwise have.  The removal of much of the pollutants from coal combustion, due to decreased coal consumption and the addition of scrubbers to the exhaust from those facilities that still burn coal have removed much of the parasol, too.  This is also driving the temperatures higher, quicker.",UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA,1.0,Ugwq_IvQTZlE4krghYF4AaABAg,AV2DvfWKyC0,2018-01-29T09:30:01Z,climate crisis

Meanwhile the Superpower ready to invade those warm places, the whole of Greenland had to come back because of the fast melting of thousands of cubic miles of ice  .

The warm evaporation is going up. Along with the warmed air. Something like more air must replace it and it usually comes from the surface and it's bound to be cooler . In a Low Pressure, air will flow in to replace the one gone up. You don't have to go to the Stratosphere to bring down the much cooler air. And as it is now, the upper Troposphere where the air is close to or below 0 (sorry 32) is overloaded with water vapor which in turn will add to the clouds already around the Low Pressure by condensation of the moist in the center of the L . 

Look, sometimes it's hot as hell outside. The temperatures are 100 F or more. Not a single cloud is in sight . 
Why are there no clouds? Because a mass of COLD DRY air is above you and it's coming down because it's cold. At a low height it stops falling and spreads outwards taking the clouds away .
So how come you're frying an egg on the hood of your car instead of being cold.
There's a barrier between the air next to the ground and the one coming down. This is a H (High Pressure).
IF that barrier is pierced for some reason, the Hot Moist air will immediately do what it does when in contact with colder air. It goes up. And fast. The moisture in contact with cooler air will turn from vapor into liquid water. Very small, microscopic droplets. That's what clouds are made of. Not vapor. It's invisible. 
Back to our cloud. There's a breach letting all that moisture form a Vertical cloud. If the breach is big enough you'll see the cloud getting taller and taller till at the top it will start spreading horizontally. There, you have a Cumulonimbus or a  storm cloud. Hail, lightening and heavy downpours. In certain areas of the USA a mass of cold air clashes with a mass of warm and very moist air. You call it the Tornado Alley.
The clouds form the same way but at a much larger scale. What produces the Tornadoes is unknown to me.

Now, reverse the pressure.
Down, at Sea level the water is very warm. An updraft of moist air happens, depriving a vast area of Air but just a tiny fraction. We are dealing with a low pressure (L) and the air going up leaves room for the in fllow  of new air. It's always colder. And that condesaees the vapor into a variety of clouds. Low (Nimbus, Stratocumulus  ( horizontal clouds and higher , Cumulus and Cumulonimbus and at the top the Cyrrus (Jets and Jetstream high the difference is the water droplets are ice. It's not an Iceberg. It won't fall catastrophically.

All this amassing of rain clouds didn't start with an isolated incident inside a H.
It was caused by an L which in turn owes its existence to the warm temperatures of the Ocean and the ensuing phenomenon of attraction of cold air, moist or dry, doesn't account for the condenssation of the warm ocean.
What we saw with Hurricane Harvey was movement of the L turned sour and earning the name of Hurricane and  its own Name.  It was moving, Cat. 5 (I think) at some point and then it ran out of energy in temperature differential with the surrounding areas. But it didn't run out of the 50 inches of water it happily shared with the people of Houston. It had lost the energy to move. Normally it would dissipate.
It did but not before all the flooding. That's not usual at all. 
We're warning the air and increasing the water vapor in the lower atmosphere and that's the one that counts.",UCWH0K4Rn0itwkWte97VUDVQ,1.0,UgzNTp6oWgdDajsxf2p4AaABAg,AV2DvfWKyC0,2018-01-29T09:30:01Z,climate crisis

If I pulled up the storm histories of the 1920's and 1950's I could show specific storms just as bad or worse and more of them.  As I linked the most severe storms, top 10, seemed to be in the 1960's to 70's era.

Total severe storms are down worldwide and per IPCC and NOAA existing storms cannot be shown to have any relationship to warming.  Overall intensity of storms is down as well.  That intensity decrease may be good or bad as some worry the less intensity may mean lingering longer over specific locals.

By the way, storm intensity is speed and affected by differences in temperature. Warming means less difference so less severe intensity.  On the amount of rainfall in a storm, there is a possibility of more rain in storm.

I know that 5 is bigger than 1. But you didn't have the personnel and the means to fight the fires as you do today and yet you still have many of them out of control.
Check the number of Typhoons in the Pacific, I meant the Intensity.
Try again closer to home and DO count in all the ones that didn't make landfall in the USA . And check the Category.  The excuse 'it has happened in the past' is not valid. These stronger than usual events have already happened many times in the past. 
In the 20th Century, Houston, we are in trouble Happened with 15"" of rainfall. This time Houston we are in deep 50 inches  of rain and it doesn't seem to be stopping. It did. But that was an average. 
A Cat. 3 in NYC is not normal. The year before you had a tropical storm, the leftovers of some Hurricane.
Lisbon, , a year ago was in the path of a Cat. 4, then 3 then it turned North outside the shores and I think it went on as a tropical storm, or a very strong winds storm further North to France and faded. This Hurricane formed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean where the water temperatures are usually too cold to start such a strong candidate to the destruction of downtown Lisbon (it really needs renovating, for me, the tourists love it). Just like a Parisian fed up with the steel structure so many people come to see. The Eiffel Tower. I've been up there maybe 15 times, enough to  understand the French.

Summary: you seem to care about your Country and never mind what's going on elsewhere. Wrong, it's all part of the same phenomenon.
Cycles. Yes they exist and last millions of years then in a period of time we cannot fathom, the next cycle settles in. It took thousands of years to come from one to the other.
We are making the change against the Natural Cycle, which would plunge us in a new Ice Age IN THOUSANDS OF YEARS, and we're doing it in 200, 300 years.
This is not Abrupt but almost Instantaneous Change of the Climate Patterns, so predictable. For us it's taking forever. For Nature it's a blink of an eye.
Don't forget how short the oldest man or woman still alive is in Geological terms.
Everything looks like it is not happening or it's taking an eternity.
For Earth , it's brutally fast. The CO2 warms very slightly the Global Temperature and the Oceans get a tiny warmer. 70 to 80 % of the Earth Surface starts evaporating much more. And the biggest amount of Greenhouse  Gas is water vapor. Much more rain when it's drawn into a strong Depression, L for low pressure,. When the cold Air more humid than the usual is sucked in a low pressure to replace the warm air evaporated upwards, the warm air evaporated, thus full of water vapor meets cold Air we have the Condensation of the warm vapor.
And a tropical storm is starting. But we have a new problem. The cold Air brought with it a lot more water vapor which logically will be added to the one already there. Now we have a a hell of a lot of clouds we were not anticipating .
And if this Storm does what they usually do, they will become bigger and stronger Hurricanes pouring down rain like they usually don't.
Floods will be more frequent. In other places, what some got in excess, it's entirely absent, but droughts don't last days or weeks not even months. It's measured in years. Sometimes, during a persistent drought the excess of water vapor may be responsible for heavy downpours and flash floods. 
All are happening in numbers, intensity across the World. But you don't believe because you don't see it and maybe you don't know it happened. I bet you didn't know that Mozambique, an African Southeastern country has been flattened by a Cyclone. And the water that went in with the storm surge receded so fast that many people were killed by those flows of fast moving mud with the help of the giant rains.
When it was over, everything was flooded. Two weeks later unexpected huge downpours came in to see if the flooded Country would continue to be so for a while longer. This is one of the poorest Countries in the World.

The seasons are predictable based on the rotation of the planet around the sun and the angle of the earth.  There is no astrophysical reason that should change as it has nothing to do with co2 or warming.

Storms etc are not worse and in fact intense storms are fewer in number per NOAA and the IPCC.  We are setting records on the decreased number of intense hurricanes and tornado based on current records.  Only one of the worst hurricanes in history has occurred since 1980. https://www.thoughtco.com/most-powerful-hurricanes-and-typhoons-in-world-history-3443613

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2013/05/08/sorry-global-warmists-but-extreme-weather-events-are-becoming-less-extreme/#6824ec1a55a4

Drought is Less as the planet is greening due to more CO2 and rain is increasing with warmer climate, not decreasing.  A normal trend based on geological history.  Satellite images show enhanced greening, not desert.  https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth
https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/human-activity-in-china-and-india-dominates-the-greening-of-earth-nasa-study-shows

There is no prediction that southern or equatorial zones would be uninhabitable.  The impact of warming is greatest at the poles and decreases as you move to equatorial zones.  Temperatures on the planet would be more uniform meaning Less intense storms due to less difference in mixing air.

Northern zones would warm more leading to a larger temperate zone thus more land available and longer growing seasons.  There is nothing to refute that.  Again part of any projection and supported by geological history.

As far as slowing down the rise, best guess per IPCC is only 0.2C different from no action if we went completely stone age.  So any  action is actually fairly futile and minimal in effect.  Adjusting to change is more reliable and would not cause the deaths the loss of energy, food, and other developments necessary to assure resources for our population.

By the way, Polar Bears have not been decreasing. They have been increasing in Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia ever since the ban on hunting them in the 1970's.  Their estimated population has at least tripled.  https://www.thegwpf.org/as-polar-bear-numbers-increase-gwpf-calls-for-re-assessment-of-endangered-species-status/",UCQ_mBLdf8z8tr80WynG7DRA,1.0,UgzNTp6oWgdDajsxf2p4AaABAg,AV2DvfWKyC0,2018-01-29T09:30:01Z,climate crisis

Back in the 1930s you didn't have a big population and the firemen were not that abundant. I bet you no houses, let alone towns, were burned down to the ground.
But today you have a Elite of Firemen (except the prisoners) you have choppers and planes to help put out the fires. Yet I still hear you saying that some of them are out of control, and towns did burn down. In Portugal around 100 people were killed in wildfires inside their cars as they were driving. The fire cut the road, they turned back only to find they were surrounded by smoke and fires. 
This happened twice I think, last year. We are well equipped but not to handle fires started by criminals or more likely to be Pyromaniacs in several places very often it's quick and there's more than one person, and they start the new fires in the opposite direction of the wind. 
Maybe you don't get these news in the States, but Portugal and Greece are mentioned everytime the past few winter's have been not too rainy and the Summers are blazing hot (I'm talking about 40 ¬∞C to 45¬∞C or 104¬∞F and 113¬∞F [115 to make it a round number]).

The Holocene Era is getting to its End and we can count on the Anthropocene.
The Holocene is marked by an exceptionally good Climate. I didn't say weather.
But the Climate, the 4 seasons were so (Vivaldi can tell you more about it) predictable that we no longer had to follow the Animals to hunt them.
You could settle down and live off the crops. It was easy. But it was not before this very short time in Geological terms. The Anthropocene is not going to bring us a predictable Climate and seasons . Forget the bread basket moving further North.
1) The South would be unfit for Human Life, and most life for that matter. Either  because of years long droughts or more powerful extreme events like Hurricanes, Blizzards, and also some weeks of vacation by the beach. But you wouldn't know for how long. The Population is growing. Where do you stack those people, among which you and I could be included.
The same will happen further North. The Climate, and the predictably of the weather would be a big problem in the choice of the crops. 
This wonderful Predictable Climate has allowed the Human Species to change from Hunter Gatherers  to Sedentary (opposite of Nomad) , and from then on we have built towns, cities, where people were concentrated  and protected from possible Invaders, eventually it lead to the World we now have, not a Word of Prosperity, unless the less than 70 Richest People on the Planet would share their Wealth, absurdly big for such a life expectancy. Let them keep enough to be rich and do nothing for life and the rest  would solve a great deal of the Present Wealth Inequality, between people (individuals) and People (The People of a Country, now living below the poverty line, and then, everyone would have a good life. No major problems.
This inequality will disappear if nothing is done in regards to Climate Change because everyone would be in trouble finding food, fresh water and land for the moving Refugees to get past. 
We would go back to being Nomads. May I recall you that the Syrians we're not happy because they had a massive amount of people from the countryside to the city after 7 years of unprecedented drought. 5 years of drought in California. You could combat it because you have the $ ability.
But you couldn't stop several category 5 hurricanes in the same year. You can have a smaller number if you don't count those that crossed the Gulf to the shores of Central America. And Puerto Rico. The USA President (??) Trumpccident didn't. Why would you do that to events that have nothing to do with your Country? 
Maybe you are more reasonable than most people I read in threads like this or Political ones. There seems to be a European Country, an African one, India, China, Russia, Russia, Russia, the Artic, Antarctica, Penguins to the South and Polar Bears up in the Artic Ocean (not a Continent) I'm sorry for these lessons for kids, but I have had too many people under 5 with a driver's license.

Just wanted to make sure you understand that moving North is not a solution. That's not what's happening and very likely not what will happen.
Technologies to help slow down this moment of change, DO exist, are very advanced, no fluctuations in peak demand for power would happen in fact, while I was receiving a call from YouTube saying I had a üëç here, I found out that the Germans had to shut down a big part of their Solar Panels because they were producing too much electricity and something could catch on fire. I've been to Germany, always in the Summer and few were the days I didn't take my umbrella. I almost missed the Total Eclipse of the Sun in 1999.

I honestly don't know what you're talking about. You may have mistook me for someone else. I have no team, except the Common Sense that says one thing only . We must act now.

This is from me.
When some  People talk about the year 2100 or 2050 ( why not 2038 or 2178) they predict with a 99.99% margin of error what MIGHT happen then. Not what will happen. They just want to make a movie about catastrophic events and we know they attract lots of public.
Aside from that, the effects won't be felt suddenly at any point in time .  They will evolve to the worse faster and faster.
Earth is a big planet and it takes time to gain  momentum, passed  which, we may loose the ability to predict the future at short term.
Those areas you mentioned will have warmer weather but will life adapt? Or will there be an ecologic disaster.  And I'm not an all convinced it'll last for long.

This is a typical science experiment that you would perform in high school.
As soon as methane emits from ground, from methane hydrate on the ocean bottom, from YOUR bottom, it ""oxidizes"", when it encounters oxygen molecules.
When you're in the shower, enclosed in the bathroom, the smell goes away within minutes, RIGHT?
Oxidization, in process.
Methane rarely occurs at any higher level in the atmosphere, because it disappears so quickly.
But, it does exist, at numbers around ""parts"" per BILLION.
Water, the sun, and Earths position, in relation to the sun.
Long term, that is what heats up, or cools down, Earth.
But, if you have a massive volcanic eruption, it emits sulfur dioxide.
That turns into an aerosol, it will have a cooling affect.
Ash plumes have a cooling affect, short term.
Large Meteor impacts, have a cooling affect.
The permian - triassic, flood basalt eruption lasted 30,000 to 500,000 years.
That poisoned the atmosphere, poisoning the seas, becoming anoxic, and killing 95% of species.
The triassic - cretaceous extinction, was also a massive, flood basalt eruption.
Both extinctions were due to sulfur, then sulfur dioxide, then sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.
Methane WAS NOT prevelant.
Co2 had a small affect, but was present.

Co2 is inside EVERYTHING.
Co2 keeps us from freezing.

The methane problem: The dominant sink of methane in the troposphere is reaction with hydroxyl radicals that are formed by reaction of singlet oxygen atoms with water vapor.
So it is entirely controllable at very low cost.
Just concentrate oxygen here on the ground and seed clouds with it. Nearly every city on earth already have gas concentration systems for many industries it is a well know old tech so cheap.

Greenhouse environment on Earth occurs only in solar cycles with extremely high sunspot activity, over periods of MILLIONS of years.
400 ppm co2, is nowhere near enough co2 to indicate a greenhouse.
It is'nt co2, anyway.
Its solar output, and orbital tilt.
The current ""tilt"", is conducive to long winters, and short summers.
As soon as the sun stops spot activity, we'll slowly dive into glacial maximum, over a period of roughly 30,000 to 40,000 years.
When co2 bottoms at 180 ppm, past cycles have indicated an abrupt warming, within 20,000 years, into interglacial.
Wikipedia has a great article on ice ages.
You should read it.
Methane:
Don't listen to the BS about methane collecting in the atmosphere, and causing a greenhouse.
Methane NEVER rises above .00017% of the atmosphere because, it oxidizes in oxygen.
It turns into co2, and water vapor.
Water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas.
It can't cause greenhouse, without the sun heating up the troposphere.
Earth hasn't had a greenhouse in 55 million years.
This was because of a solar maximum event.
The sun had a whole bunch of sunspots occurring, constantly, for almost 1 million years.
If you use common sense when you think about the globe warming, you could only come to one assumption, and that is the Sun.
Mankind's emissions are 4% of the tropospheric content, and they are absorbed within 12 months.
Gav, there is only one reason why you have been taught this, and then constantly barraged with this information, and that is to collect tax revenue from you.
Please learn to seek out this information on your own.
Stop looking for this information at your usual websites.
Seek out unbiased information, and especially, older information that still exists, but is very hard to find.
13 years ago I believed in this conspiracy theory.
I began to seek out the information on my own because, I am a alpha male, that does not like another man telling me what to do.
Please, do yourself a favor, and stop being led around by your nose.
I would appreciate it if you let me know how it went, once you begin your journey.
I am on Facebook.
Erik Johnson, from Seattle.

During the 400+ years of the ""Little Ice Age"", ending around 1875,  during which time sea levels were fairly stable, the earth's glaciers advanced for miles and the freezing temperatures were responsible for the deaths of over 65 million people, as well as the destruction of Napoleon's Grand Army.  Since then, sea levels have risen about 8 inches. Nothing really odd about the slight increase in annual sea level rise, after nearly 500 years of ""Global Cooling"" and increased glaciation. Further, I note that there have been 3 major periods of sea level rise - each lasting centuries - since the end of the last period of Global Glaciation.

Bonus Factoid...98% of global sea level rise, since the end of the  most recent period of global glaciation, 11,000+years ago, took place before Christ was born.   

Ice is the destroyer of civilization. Stuff grows well in the tropics or in a green house...on a glacier...not so much.

So, we have...

...over $ 6,000,000,000,000.- that were pumped into the economy. Man, that's a lot of zeros in that number.
There are 328,200,000 people in the US, roughly.
So, then $ 18,282.- could have been paid out to every American, including every single child and over-100-year-old.
Let's say we only gave $ 15,000.- to every citizen instead. Still a nice chunk of money. A family with 2 children would get $ 60,000.- 
Then there'd be a remaining $ 1,077,000,000,000.- left to pay out to small business and corporations to pay them to either run idle if they can, and to support all those businesses that can't.

I think that would have helped a lot of citizens and businesses of these United States a lot more to get over the next 6 months. Especially, as we all know and love our friends in Washington, I guarantee you, by the time six months from now are up (so, we're talking mid-November), those geniuses will have spent another 6 trillion.

308,UgzUNF4o5MoyxSBX9Sx4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-05-14T05:13:45Z,DaBluntTruth,"Viral FACTS:
Viruses cannot enter through the skin or eyes. Such vectors do not work because the mucus membranes and the immune system discard small amounts of foreign proteins such as viruses.
Viruses cannot enter through wounds because we bleed outwardly, not inwardly.
Viruses do not 'exist' outside of petri-dish solutions or a living body.
Viruses cannot function without a host cell that manufactures them and encodes them, and viruses cannot replicate without a host cell.
Viruses do not 'infect' or 'invade' cells. They are not alive to do so in the first place. Viruses almost never dissolve living tissue, unless in specific circumstances such as polio and degenerative nervous system diseases where metal toxicity is present.
Viruses' primary function is to dissolve dead matter.
Cells produce different viral strains depending on the condition of the tissue involved.
There are 320,000 viral strains inherent to the human body, and each cell contains the viral protein makeup to manufacture each strain when the body calls for it.
Viruses are sequenced/encoded by blood cells via RNA/DNA to break down specific dead and dying tissue and waste. Viruses are very specific protein structures.
Coughing, sneezing, and spitting is not a vector for the transmission of viruses. Saliva and mucus membranes break down any such particles. Skin is not a vector either because viruses cannot cross dead skin layers.
The only way to get a virus outside of natural means is via direct injection (vaccine) or blood transfusions of a patient who has a virus. However, in such cases, the body only analyzes it as foreign tissue that must be eliminated. Since the virus did not originate within the bodily host, that body does not know the time and place that the virus will be active nor does it have the key to decode it (RNA or DNA encoded by the cell) and cannot find the time of its activity. As such, it is analyzed as a foreign substance that must be eliminated. 

Viruses are a result of internal toxicity caused by the environment. Viruses are cyclical in animals. Viruses feed upon waste products in the blood and tissue. Throughout the year, upon season and climatic/temperature changes, the body will dump mass amounts of toxins into the blood for removal. Some of these toxins are so toxic in nature, such as mercury, formaldehyde, and other chemical byproducts, that living microbes cannot feed upon and eliminate them without dying. Non-living proteins are then manufactured by each cell in the corresponding location of the body where this cleansing is necessary. Those toxic substances are disassembled and broken down by viruses so that the body can eliminate them, restoring homeostasis.
Viruses cannot cross-species ie; from animal to mankind. It is impossible for humans to develop animal flus‚ÄîA. Because viruses are not contagious, and, B. Because animal RNA/DNA is not compatible with human RNA/DNA. The only way animal tissue can be observed in the blood is through injection of animal tissues, which make their way to the blood, bypassing the digestive tract.

As for the outcome, you are correct, no one really knows.  But are you willing to chance what the *vast* majority of scientists are saying for some scientists that have been paid off by energy companies or have other agendas?  I'm not saying all of them have, but the sheer consensus is quite overwhelming, wouldn't you say?  What harm is there to start seriously looking at alternative energies.  Solar, wind and water are a long way off from sustaining our energy needs as they rely on storage and the technology needs to improve a thousand fold before it's viable.  
This is one alternative that could gain traction.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TerraPower

Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned ‚Äì Romans 5:12. How did sin enter the world? Through Adam and Eve - Genesis 3:1-24

Through Adam death, through Jesus Life
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life ‚Äì Romans 5:18

But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God - Romans 3:21-23.

Through law, death. Through faith, Everlasting Life

Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin - Romans 3:19-20

..Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. - Romans 3:24-26

Who is Jesus Christ? 

- THE SON OF GOD - And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased - Matthew 3:17
And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God - Matthew 16:16
- THE WORD OF GOD - For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart - Hebrews 4:12.
- THE DOOR TO EVERLASTING LIFE - I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture - John 10:9
- THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE -  I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me - John 14:6
- GOOD SHEPHERD - I am the good Shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep John 10:11. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd - John 10:14 - 16
- THE LIGHT - I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life - John 8:12
- BLESSED HOPE - Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ - Titus 2:13
- THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD - He died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 1Corinthians 15:1-4 - The Gospel of Salvation.
- THE BREAD OF LIFE - I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world - John 6:48 - 51, and much more.

Why Jesus Christ came? Because God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth on Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life - John 3:16 

He loves you very much - He made us, He is our CREATOR - Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart - Jeremiah 1:5. It means, that God knows us perfectly, He knows what is our needs - He knows what you need before you ask Him - Matthew 6:8

Jesus Christ laid his life, for you, because He loves you - Jesus Christ died on the Cross, was buried and He rose again the third day ‚Äì 1Corinthians 15:1-4, The Gospel of Salvation. 

What to do to became a child of God?

A ‚Äì Admit you are a sinner in need of a Savior. As it is written: There is non righteous, no, not one ‚Äì Romans 3:10. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God ‚Äì Romans 3:23

B ‚Äì Believe on finished redemptive work of Jesus Christ on the Cross ‚Äì Jesus Christ died on the Cross, was buried and He rose again the third day ‚Äì 1Cor 15:1-4. If you want to enter to the Kingdom of Heaven, you must be like a child ‚Äì children trust their parents. Why I mention parents? Because God is our Creator.
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. - Ephesians 2:8-9 

C ‚Äì Call on the name of the Lord and you will be saved - If you declare with your mouth, ‚ÄúJesus is Lord,‚Äù and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved ‚Äì Romans 10:9-10. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved ‚Äì Romans 10:13.

Jesus Christ is the shower/water, that cleans us of all unrighteousness - come now, let us settle the matter, says the Lord. Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; thought they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool - Isajah 1:18

May God bless you and not harden your heart. May God gives you eyes to see and ears to hear, what He is saying..

 things you should do to help:
1. Stop eating meat.
2.Plant trees.
3. Switch off electrical appliances at least for 30 minutes for a day.
4. Use Paper until it is unusable. 
5. Stop encroachments.
6. Don't throw pet animals especially dog out of home, this will cause the animals to search for a home and will cause problems for other animals as humans are cutting forests down.
7.Afforestation.
8. Stop smoking.
9. Don't burn garbage. 
10. Use more public transportation. 
11. Use more cycles and see if you can use solar panels for electricity.
12. Don't waster water as we have only 0.04 % freshwater leftover on the surface the other percentage is present as groundwater and in polar glaciers.
13. Just do what you can to help, which everyone can do.

1) We burn lots of stuff: coal, gasoline, wood, etc for heat energy
2) The burning releases huge amounts of CO2 into the air
3) CO2 in the air makes it harder for heat to escape from the Earth (as IR radiation) and so the atmosphere heats up some compared to before, and the CO2 has ""staying power"" there
4) a hotter atmosphere helps more H20 get there which also similarly leads to even more heating
5) all that changes air flow, temperatures and large scale rain/snow patterns on yearly average, for each season
6) you get more drought in some places and more rain in others, on average, plus more extremes in temperatures 
7) with more drought, fires that normally and naturally occur become more extreme in frequency and extent (they don't die out as easily)
8) MAGA and QAnon nutcases blame arsonists for the fires and here's what else they do

Is that there is a clear indication that much warmer temperatures are connected to more severe forest fires. The most simple explanation, is that if you put humid (wet) pieces of wood into the oven, the more you increase the temperature (dialing up the oven),  the more that water evaporates from the wood and it gets dryer. The more dry wood you have, the more pieces catch fire and can burn longer, just like a campfire or fireplace but then much, much bigger.

Positive feedback loops have been a thing ever since the Earth's trajectory around the Sun. Where normally these are activated by moving away from a glacial period due to the increased sunlight our Earth receives, which naturally warms up the atmosphere and activates positive feedback loops. One example is the thawing of permafrost which releases CH4 (Methane), which traps heat like it does now and results in warming up the atmosphere even more, thus thawing more permafrost and the loop is established. The issue now though, is that we with our human contribution not only have done what nature normally takes thousands of years to do, we accelerate this process while it's ongoing.

Here's what:
1) Arson created fires
2) Fires release CO2
3) CO2 makes it harder for heat to escape and so the atmosphere heats up 
4) a hotter atmosphere helps more H20 get there which also leads to more heating
5) all that changes air flow, temperatures and rain/snow patterns on yearly average, for each season
6) you get more drought in some places and more rain in others, on average
7) with more drought fires that normally and naturally occur become more extreme
8) MAGA and QAnon nutcases blame arsonists for the fires and here's what else they do

Just yrs
We have just years to save the day.
We have just years to lead the way.
We have just years to save our world
And educate our boys and girls!

The futures looking pretty bleak.
The earth more toxic every week.
The children look to us for hope
But our world leaders are a joke..

The poisons caused by how we live,
Infecting all the oceans fish.
It's in the air made by the trees
That's killing off the birds and bees.

This planet was a gift from God
To tend to it man's only job.
God sacrificed his only son.
To save us from what we'd become.
So did our saviour die in vain?
So we could live to pass the blame.
Will we repeat our fathers sins?
As children watch the end begin!

We have just years to change our fate
To halt and fix our own mistakes
We have just years to stay alive
To pray our planet can survive

No resources, no hope or prayer,
Will save us if we don't prepare.
When it's too late, will we repent?
Regret the time that wasn't spent,

This generation could be last
Humanity part of the past
So adults need to understand
And come up with a master plan.

We had our chance that we ignored.
The children now our only cause.
It's time to stand up, no delays.
Or they will live the end of days!!!!

I always have a threesome.
On this I cannot lie!
It‚Äôs not my fault it‚Äôs in my blood, 
I am a Gemini.

It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm sexy.
My looks not special too.
Don‚Äôt take it as rejection,
I‚Äôm just not into you!

It‚Äôs not Because you‚Äôre ugly,
That you can‚Äôt achieve a goal.
I am not into girls instead 
That isn‚Äôt how I roll!

Don‚Äôt think that I am easy,
Or sleep with any guy!
Cause Every night I climb in bed with.............

Nostradamus said it first!
The end is nigh! No joke no lie 
The world will die With you and I 
The time has come nowhere to run 
As was foretold will now become 
The anti-Christ Has now arrived 
His evil will explode our sky's 
With clever words and bad intentions 
This man won all the elections 
Living in his money tower
Practising political power 
Promises and lies untold 
Working on the human souls 
No sooner was this man was elected 
All sense and reason was rejected 
His arrogance is narcissistic 
All actions are antagonist 
Already breaking every vow 
Babylon his nation now 
The truth abused and ostracised 
Until no longer recognised 
In such short time,he's set the course 
Nation to nation show of force 
Divide and rule to break our trust 
Until our worlds reduced to dust
Humanity's now torn asunder 
Demonic forces pull us under 
The world will slowly realise 
That this man is the prince of lies
The time has come to beg and pray 
Forgiveness for the end of days. üôèüèª

Regarding solar output fluctuations, those are well understood by scientific organisations that put satellites into LEO or Space, like the SOHO project from NASA. ESA is another major one  that deals with this in collaboration with other scientific organisations globally for ground-based solar observation. What you are describing with Earth's orbit and differences deal with Milankovitch cycles, which again are well understood and how they relate to incoming solar energy and what amount of energy then gets trapped (GHGs) which relates to the Earth's energy balance. As well as what chemical (CH4, CO2, O2 etc) concentrations were present back then with findings with ice cores samples, to name one example.  All this science and actual observable findings, have been incorporated for decades by thousands of scientists, cross-referenced, adjusted and then are left with a resulting body of evidence that is not just used in those scientific areas globally, but also written down in the  books regarding to education.

I'm guessing you are aware that the energy the sun projects towards the earth fluctuates. Sometimes these fluctuations are rhythmic or predictable and sometimes not. Also the earths orbit is by no means a perfect circle and our distance from the sun is always changing. Then of course there is our weakened magnetosphere due to the approaching pole change to consider. There are a great many variables that contribute to our climates changing and we cant hope to fully understand them yet if ever. Many of these variables are going to be out of humankinds control forever. Some of them we can control easily.

Wildfire's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna. Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions.

Strategies for wildfire prevention, detection, control and suppression have varied over the years. One common and inexpensive technique is *controlled burning* : *intentionally igniting smaller fires to minimize the amount of flammable material available for a potential wildfire.* Vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and limit the accumulation of plants and other debris that may serve as fuel.",UC5qj9vhKJJrv42JbTasMY7w,0.0,Ugx22qiY6vvhk8n92qZ4AaABAg,7pAGogxrse8,2020-09-18T13:53:41Z,climate crisis

First of all, when we're talking about global climate change, mentioning that New York and San Francisco will have the equivalent average climates of cities at lower latitudes is very irrelevant and misleading. It makes Global Warming sound like a meer raise in temperatures. What you should be addressing is how cities like Los Angeles, Sandiego, Miami, the Florida Keys, Houston and New Orleans will have a much higher index of erractic weather patterns that will be extremely difficult to prepare for or predict. Not only that, but the frecuency of storms will also increase exponentially. World-wide the Earth's climate will be driven by a new set of umpredictable patterns which will develop, not according to an established global cycle of air and ocean currents, but according to the new driver of weather patterns,  greenhouse gases.

Addressing your claim about climate models, it is false. Models often give great predictions (see source below) but as it is impossible to observe and compute every molecule and every interaction with the complex physical equations that models use, they are approximations. One of the ways we try to combat this is through the use of ensemble models. These ensemble models are initialized with slightly different initial conditions and slightly different parameters to address uncertainty. These produce a range of results which are either averaged or used in a percentage of seeing a certain outcome. Now, the claim that we have a plastics problem is 100% correct. These plastics don‚Äôt just take a long time to decompose, but are treacherous for ecosystems and wildlife.

Really? This map of 2080 changes is not going to get most people the least bit excited about jumping on the sound-the-alarm bandwagon. If anything, especially given the expectation of technological innovation, it strengthens the dismissal of the alarmists' caterwauling. 

And, by the way, the unadorned call-to-arms has gotten extremely tiresome. If you're going to report this as a serious concern, just present some alternative 'solutions' and give the estimated potential benefit-costs of each.

Most scientists will have to admit humans may be having some effect, even while they believe change is natural and always occuring.
This should not be controversial, if all scientist were ""allowed"" to meet, discuss and determine mans part.
But they are not.
Science is a theory, nothing is decided if its science.
A number of years ago almost every doctor believed ulcers were due solely to stomach acid until it was proven otherwise.
Science can not ignore strong factual data because the religion of CO2 is threatened.
Political platforms, personal fortunes and reputations.
A Paris accord would demand trillions, held and directed by who.
The power to control governments around the world via carbon credits and an opportunity to dictate industry and who will develop these new technologies.
The Paris accord, has anyone perused it?
A handshake agreement would demand little of China and India. They would virtually get a pass for over 10 years as ""developing nations"".
The US would immediately give each of these countries almost a billion each every year.
Every US family ( based on 4 people)would contribute over 22,000 a year.
If new technologies were to be developed who would be granted the right to develop them, ""developing nations""
While the US paid for everybody, industry would likely go elsewhere.
We all know how bad China and India require this support.

thanks for the explanation..
if that whole model is True. 
it would suggest possible flooding with a New Moon, not a Full Moon then..  correct?.

also, in relation to the Sun, there isnt much of a possitional difference between a New Moon and a 2-4 day Moon..  or the 26-29 day Moon, right before the News Moon..   (waxing/waning  Moons..)

37 Jesus replied: ‚Äú‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.‚Äô[a] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‚ÄòLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô[b] 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.‚Äù

Funny thing is, this is taught in school in SCIENCE!.

Fiction: CO2 absorbs heat (how can it when heat rises and it doesn't even get that high) and keeps it from escaping (how can it ABSORB heat and also warm the air up? Absorbing it means to GET RID OF! Not BLOCK IT) and the CO2 just heats and heats, somehow even heats and heats winter too. Another lie, the CO2 does the sun's job at controlling the climate and being the NUMBER 1 cause of climate change and the NUMBER 1 ingredient for life other than Water!. So long story short, we don't need the sun, CO2 obviously does a better job according to them, so we'll just get rid of it, then we stop the process of plants, animals, everything, even land funny enough!.

You think basic physics says CO2 is a one way absorber of heat? That's totally AGAINST science right there!

Oh yup, a HEAVY gas 1.5x heavier than air that somehow causes global warming high up in the upper atmosphere? Come on bro, think BASIC physics!. The CO2 absorbs the heat and releases some of it back into space, because since it's 1.5x heavier than air, as it sinks, it loses its already weak heat trapping properties. 

Water Vapour is released with the CO2 to strengthen the transfer of heat that the CO2 loses as it sinks, therefore causing it to be muggy when it's going to rain, through convection NOT absorption!. Notice how the cloud cover blocks the sun, but also makes the air more humid. 

Yet you say CO2 is a pollutant? What the hell is that? Basic fact says CO2 is an INVISIBLE, ODOURLESS, TASTELESS gas, just like Oxygen!. 

Plus I really don't care if my comment is scientifically inaccurate, it means you ignored most of it anyways!. Plus, science isn't about being right, cos there's no such thing, it's about proving others wrong!.  

Religion IS about being right, and religion IS about not questioning things like global warming, if you were an actual scientist, you'd totally agree with me on this! Regardless of how my comment looks! I type it up in a way IE can interpret it!. And I know you'll call me autistic, cos I AM!.

What I meant by absorbing means get rid of, is to SOAK the heat like a sponge with water!. But I can't see how a heavy gas can trap heat and cause a shift in climate! You'd expect water vapour to do this, but this only strengthens convection transfer, basically where we get wind from, and that wind can carry rain from the oceans to inland areas! So global warming is actually a GOOD thing! 

Yeah the sea level will rise temporarily, but because there's more water to evaporate, there's going to be more CO2, more Vapour in the atmosphere, and where is it going to end up? In the desert areas around the equator first! Then what's going to happen? New ecosystems, more lush greenery in areas that used to be barren, and this is going to eventually make areas full of greenery even more green. More water + more CO2 = life blooming!.

Doesn't mean it's going to be an oven, that's just scare mongering!. You can't have heat without a heat source! Cos that's where it all stems from.",UCWlrGg-WgYZI0d9bIMloBKA,1.0,Ugw_7Z9td0k67TVlzx14AaABAg,SQ7bzR99iJ4,2016-11-19T02:46:46Z,climate crisis

I can see with my own eyes that the climate in my local area is warmer than it was when I was a child forty years ago. This is however anecdotal evidence and even if it were more forty years is not even a blip on the timeline of the climate history of the Earth. The century and a half of recording science is also but a snippet of information on the billions of years of Earth's history. Have you listened to the many research and climate scientists who have been denied funding to study an alternative view of the issues surrounding climate? What is Liberal academia and government officials afraid of? Are they afraid of a biased opinion from those who are skeptical? Is there any chance the left is biased in it's study of climate and only reports information that supports their agenda? 

For me there is a different issue. What will be the impact of a warmer more productive climate? In periods of much higher concentrations of Co2 the Earth was much more productive. Everyone who owns a greenhouse knows that plants do better with very high levels of Co2. People living near the coasts will likely have to move farther inland over the next two hundred years but that is not so unusual in the history of mankind. Man has foolishly inhabited many areas that historically been poor choices. Flood zones being the most obvious. Much of New Orleans being under sea level. People in Hawaii live on an active volcano. The fire zones that have been turned into housing developments out West. 

While it is important to think about what could happen if the worst of the predictions of climate alarmists comes true it is probably at least equally important to think about the certainties that we live in such as the previously mentioned incompetence of man and governments. There isn't one single climate scientist who would argue that the coastal cities of the Southeast United States do not face a certainty of hurricanes. This is a real issue.

ACT:  Warmist's adjusted away the Medieval Warming, a period of prosperity for mankind.  FACT:  Warmist's claim the Little Ice Age was a local phenomenon--without any supporting evidence.  This is new because there was no mention of it being local until they were trying to refute the obvious conclusion that man did not cause the warming or cooling. The Little Ice Age caused dramatic changes worldwide.  It's not ""local"" if present on every continent that kept records.  FACT:  CO2 does not correlate as a cause of warming.  It is a poor greenhouse gas.  FACT: CO2 is good for the planet.  The Earth is getting greener and not turning into a desert.  FACT: Meddling with the ecology has so far done more harm than good.  Killing 40,000 elephants to prevent desertification jsut proves that scientists don't know shit about complex systems like the ecology.  FACT:  The elites stand to profit enormously (trillions) on warming.  FACT:  A single volcano can easily bring down temperatures for years.  Why does no one discuss cheap options like triggering a volcano if so concerned about warming.  Could it be, it's all about the money?  FACT: Warmist's cherry pick data and distort finding to support their case.  FACT:  60% of the people don't believe there is cause for concern.  FACT:  Science is open to discussion.  Warming is a religion that rejects facts, quashes contract opinions, discussion.  Claiming consensus does not make it true.  FACT:  Scientists get funded to support warming.  Pay someone to promote it and they will.  AND THE BIGGEST FACT OF ALL:  It is a HOAX.  Few believe in man-made CO2 warming any more because of the faked data, cherry picked data, the unwillingness to acknowledge that many, many, many scientists have different opinions.  Attacking people with different theories, models, evidence, is not the scientific method.  It should be obvious that Antarctica is a very cold landmass.  It will never be ice free.  The Arctic is surrounded by land masses.  There is no way for warm water to get in there.

Not knowing your age, I have no idea whether you were there when that idiotic VP, Al Gore was pushing the coming ice age.  He and so many others got behind that BS information declaring that over 90 percent of Scientists backed the data to support the declared cooling of the planet. 



I have learned in time to wait until facts present themselves, for actual verification.  Look at ACA!  It was declared the HealthCare solution, but it was a lie; as stated by one of its architects, Jonathan Gruber.  Who famously stated that Americans are ""Too Stupid to Understand.""  His comment was stating a fact.  Americans are in fact too stupid to read and understand the legislation that was ACA and that it was a lie, and would not stand financially.   Only Actuarials and others who understand the inner workings of insurance and economics could read it and comprehend the fact that it was utter BS.   Yet, Obama, Nancy and the rest of the Dims and many Republicans thought it was great (although none would state that they actually read the whole thing).  Hundreds of millions wasted and the cost of HealthCare has gon up in most areas, yet most people who do not work for a company that provides healthcare, cannot afford ACA.


Now, we hear those same Dims, and in particular, the latest dim whit, AOC, promoting this issue, along with the Green New Deal, another asinine idea, while millions of stupid Americans get behind it.  I doubt that even one-tenth of one percent of those who support the GND have any concept of what changes would be required to make, just to remove fossil fuel.


So please, if you, in fact, have such empirical data, get it out there for all of us to review.

The tides are one of the most important ways that the Moon affects life on Earth. They are the result of the fact that the Moon's gravitational pull does not affect all parts of Earth equally. The lunar gravity exerts a stronger pull on the parts of Earth that are closer to the Moon. Low tides and high tides are the results of gravitational pull by the moon. The moon's gravitational pull is called the tidal force. The tidal force causes Earth‚Äîand its water‚Äîto bulge out on the side closest to the moon and the side farthest from the moon.

""Science is not a consensus discipline""

^You're just throwing out phrases that mean nothing. Consensus plays an incredibly important role in science:

_Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book._
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review

_The journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field (i.e., the ""peers"" of peer review). Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published._

There's more evidence too of course.
1. Night time is warming faster than days, pointing to atmospheric changes, not solar.
2. Stratosphere and higher layers of the atmosphere are cooling due to the greenhouse effect trapping heat in the lower troposphere. If it was the sun driving climate change the upper layers would warm too.
3. Spectrometers have measured the greenhouse effect and show that less heat escapes to space in the wavelength of CO¬≤, providing empirical evidence.

What ""other surveys""? The other 97% consensus papers where not surveys.

Bray and von Storch were apparently disappointed that their surveys refuted the 97% consensus. You seem disappointed too.

Bray and Storch even went out of their way to avoid the most important question: *How much of observed warming has been caused by human CO2 emissions*. Instead they only ask about _anthropogenic_ climate change, which includes a whole host of factors that are irrelevant to the IPCC agenda. They also mix future and past, when the important evidence is whether past warming has occurred as predicted. Future warming is pure speculation.

There was a survey, I forget by whom, that actually asked for a percentage of recent observed warming that was caused by human CO2. The results were difficult to interpret since many scientists said >100%. This is apparently because they recognized that expected warming had not occurred, and since the anthropogenic contribution must be greater than zero (something skeptics also believe), greater natural forces must have counteracted it.

A telling section of the Bray survey asked about the reliability of the computer models upon which the predictions of catastrophic warming are based. Only a¬† tiny minority of climate scientists think the models will do a very good job of predicting temperatures even 50 years from now.

Indeed, listen to what climate scientists *_say_* not what non-climate scientists suppose they think. Andregg (biology professor) did NOT ask climate scientists what they thought. He counted scientists who signed off on a general IPCC statement, and then _inferred_ that those all believe that human CO2 emissions are the primary driver of climate. He then compared that number to his estimation of the number published climate skeptics. That is very far from surveying climate scientists.

Climate scientists don't get to participate in the IPCC unless they support anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC is not a scientific body, but a branch of the UN whose stated purpose is to report on any evidence that human GHG emissions are causing climate change. That's how they define _climate change._

I might as well take the number of Imans and compare that to the number of religious leaders who publicly oppose Islam, and then claim that 97% of religious leaders are Muslim.

Dennis Bray (emeritus professor at Cambridge) and Hans von Storch (professor at University of Hamburg) actually surveyed climate scientists. Theirs are the only comprehensive surveys.

1. Variation in earth‚Äôs orbit (Milankovitch cycles) - The tilt of the Earth‚Äôs axis and the shape of its orbit around the Sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years. This changes climate by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy at Earth's surface. During the last few thousand years, this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during summer, a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century [1]. Orbital cycles favorable for glaciation are not expected within the next 50,000 years [2].¬†

2. Solar Activity - Since 1978, solar irradiance has been measured by satellites. These measurements indicate that the Sun's radiative output has not increased since then, so the warming that occurred in the past 40 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the Earth. Climate models have been used to examine the role of the Sun in recent climate change. Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when only taking into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, consisting of both human influences and natural forcings [1]. Another line of evidence for the Sun's non-attributability is the differing temperature changes at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere. According to basic physical principles, the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), but cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected [2].

Areas affected by the Little Ice Age suggested largely-independent regional climate changes rather than a globally-synchronous increased glaciation. At most, there was modest cooling of the¬†Northern Hemisphere¬†during the period. This is not global. So you are wrong. Comparing this period with current global warming is an equivocation fallacy. 

And let's look at the causes. Several causes have been proposed:¬†cyclical lows in solar radiation, heightened¬†volcanic activity, changes in the¬†ocean circulation, variations in¬†Earth's orbit¬†and¬†axial tilt¬†(orbital forcing), inherent variability in global climate, and decreases in the human population. None of them are related to CO2 increase or decrease. It is disingenous to say this is conmected to global warming. For this current warming period that's happening now, we have found the most significant cause, CO2.

Then the medical warm period is completly different from today's global warming. Climatic¬†Proxy¬†records show peak warmth occurred at different times for different regions, indicating that the Medieval Warm Period was not a globally uniform event. This is not global, so you're wrong that the medieval warm period is connected to today's global warming. 

So please read and learn more. Please look at the evidence then draw your conclusion. Otherwise don't blame people for following the evidence.",UC5aK7sBAHzE2UYZYlQQBBUQ,1.0,UghaTBYvsc-RkHgCoAEC,SQ7bzR99iJ4,2016-11-19T02:46:46Z,climate crisis

They categorized the scientists as either ""convinced"" or ""unconvinced"" by the evidence. The results were that 97% of actively publishing climate scientists are convinced by the evidence of anthropogenic climate change. They also found that those scientists that were unconvinced had significantly fewer publications (in any science) than those that were convinced. This suggests that the (vocal) ""unconvinced"" group actually has done a lot less research.

We must change our lifestyle and stop mindlessly consuming what Mother Earth has so generously provided.

Grasslands have roots that are constantly growing and sequestering carbon, some as deep as 18 feet into the ground. Plant growth is stimulated by the animals that feed on it, which also provide fertilizer that increases the number of worms and dung beetles that make the soil rich and porous so water can infiltrate and be held there. It's good to have some trees, of course, as they provide shade for the animals, and having silvopasture is great, especially for pigs, but it can't apply to an entire farm. And trees eventually must die or be thinned (that's why there used to be all those beavers everywhere), which means the carbon in them is released either through fire or the gradual decomposition that happens over time. Of course, trees are valuable for lumber, too, a renewable resource. Cows grazed on regenerated pastures don't emit as much methane, and the methane they do release is absorbed by the soil microbes that live on the stuff.",UCCwyy8ZUezmgKRZyMj3KtYw,1.0,Ugz-8PSpxH1BosIAYzd4AaABAg,HuRpEA1sFow,2020-10-12T22:00:02Z,climate crisis

The food climate research network, compiled the 300 mains studies regarding the topic and stated that  AT BEST wild fed meat can sequestre 20-60% emissions created by the animals THEMSELVES in the first place. 
*1 molecule carbon when consumed than emitted by a cow becomes  36x more powerful methane damage
-Grass fed animais produce MORE methane than grain fed
- After 1-2 decades the soil reaches soil carbon equilibrium which means the soil can not sequestre anymore carbon, at what point none of the emissions from the animals would be offset forcing farmers to use MORE LAND. 
-The few studies done regarding this are not the scientific consensus and are considered to be anecdotal analysis or small impact. Even some of those studies point out that a plant based diet would be AT LEAST 4 times more efficient in sequestering carbon. ***Remember the methane is an even BIGGER issue since methane is 36 up times more destructive that carbon. Also removing carbon from the atmosphere is essential, but it can take up to 100 years to see  results while we can see positive effects in cutting methane out in 15 years.

While methane doesn't linger as long in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is initially far more devastating to the climate because of how effectively it absorbs heat.
Because methane is so potent, and because we have solutions that reduce emissions, addressing methane is the fastest, most effective way to slow the rate of warming now.
We dont have 100 years to wait to see results with just CO2 especially considering how harmful methane is. 

+++ That is the point of the plant based diet, and IT IS agreed by specialists that is the best option for fast action and results right now. No matter how it is done (obviously one way is better than other) a vegan diet uses WAY LESS land than consuming animal products since they need SO many calories from low calorie food.

We need a two-pronged approach: carbon sequestration and water sequestration. Regen ag can rebuild soil carbon. The more soil carbon, the greater the water holding capacity. However, we need perennial systems to maintain healthy water cycles. We need trees! I urge all of us, especially farmers, to look at ways they could incorporate more trees.

It's like people think they have secret meetings to come up with ways to kill the planet! Like OAC said, ""we don't need farmers, we have grocery stores""!!! Lolol she actually said that! You all need to realize farmers are not scientists, they farm as they are told to do by government and agriculture programs. The cost of equipment, seed, fertilizer, labor, grain storage and crop loss is a huge gamble for each and every farmer. No farmer wants to wreck his soil, and the video didn't mention that most modern farmers have been utilizing various soil saving building and regenerative practices for many, many years. Many of the images you show in the video were very old farming practices and ways that are no longer used. Pesticides are very expensive as are herbicides, no farmer wants to use either in excess but it is essential in limited use or there will be no yield, and no grocery stores full of Fruit loops. You over simplified a very complex equation. You conviently failed to mention that actual chemical, pesticide and fertilizer use per acre has dropped drastically over the last 40 years! Yields are higher, and farming practices are much more land friendly now than they have ever been, partly due to better equipment, education, high performance seed, and various farming practices. If you want to ""save the world"" start by reducing your driving, quit flying to vacation destinations, stop driving to Starbucks for a brew, quit charging your phones so much we need to build more power plants,. But nooo most of you won't make changes yourselves, but you think bashing farmers is the way to fix your problems. Typical public school, narrow minded, indoctrinated mindset at work here. Few people can even grow enough of a garden to provide a few meals for themselves without using Miracle grow! Lol dumbass city slickers. Rodale is an awesome entity, I personally have followed their stuff for 50 years. Some of it is proven some of it is experimental. Farmers living a living off a farm can not gamble on experimental farming practices. We can slowly incorporate proven methods of better practices over time, and we do! It would be foolish not to.

Many of the large estates and some smaller producers are already doing it successfully. But its important people understand its not simple for everyone. The use of agri-chemicals and tillage is very hard to live without on some soil types and in some climates. We have a min-till system which is helping to regenerate soils, but we still use minimal chemicals at the moment otherwise we simply wouldn't produce food. Also many of the components of regen agriculture are already present in conventional systems. Ie organic matter going back into soils, compost, cover crops, no-till. We can still be regenerative while using minimal chemicals in order to be productive, as long as they are known to be safe.

But the best filet mignon I ever had was one I prepared myself from grass-fed beef a few months ago. It was tender and had much more flavor than one I had had in a restaurant that specialised in grain-finished beef a year ago, which was tender but had no flavor. 

Joel Salatin says he gets 4 cow days per acre compared to 1 cow day for his conventional neighbors, a cow day being how much feed a cow can eat in a day. So if your land provides 4 x as much food for your animals and zero cost other than providing water and perhaps some minerals, that's a great yield, especially given it has better nutrition and gives the animals a great life in a variety of settings with plenty of the food they love.

Most regenerative farmers have smaller animals, around 1,000 pounds, so they don't tear up their pastures when it rains. This is important if you don't want to have to spend a lot on hay. If you watch Greg Judy's videos, his South Poll cows look gorgeous and are calm and happily chewing away. He leaves enough grass before moving them once or twice a day so it can grow back in a couple of months and provide another feeding. This is a great system. It does take some thought and effort, but not as much as you'd think. I believe it could help a lot of the problems we have facing us today, including health issues, unemployment, pollution, global warming, and poor nutrition. And most of all, farmers struggling to make ends meet.",UCCwyy8ZUezmgKRZyMj3KtYw,1.0,UgyTLCQ51X0zbdNXqTl4AaABAg,HuRpEA1sFow,2020-10-12T22:00:02Z,climate crisis

Take beef it takes 15 months and many more resources and space  to add 700 lbs  to a calf on grass only but 4 months more  in a feedlot.

Just to emphasize this: ""regenerative agriculture"" is _not_ identical to ""organic farming"". The former emphasizes the health of the soil and carbon sequestration, the latter avoidance (or hiding) the use of synthetic fertilizers, insecticides and pesticide. The former is sustainable agricultural practice, the latter mostly marketing. (They sometimes _do_ overlap, though.)
Also, it would help if you didn't repeat myths like ""conventional agriculture produces less nutritional crops"" than ""organic farming"". There is _no_ evidence for that.

It's nothing new but it is the right way to do things. But personally I think if we radically wanted to change agriculture towards something sustainable that stores carbon into the soil, we would have to move away from perennial plants towards tree based foods. Such as chestnut flour, sago, bamboo shoots, trees for growing mushrooms, (there's also many trees that have edible leaves)... And basically trees for everything. The positive part is that with trees much more wildlife would be present and soil build up would be considerately faster. Other point is that once trees grow deep enough roots they bring underground water to the surface also plants transpirate that makes mircoclimate that is more humid and cooler. I also believe raising animals in a forest would mean more available insects for live stock and insects bring birds which is basically natural fertiliser... And cover from the sun is also less stressful for large animals. I don't think wheat, soy, corn, rice grown organically will on its own do anything that will change global warming nor do I believe carbon storing underground is realistically possible.",UCCTeVb3-wl1XUwRxCjqbpbA,0.0,UgwpiEiAtt1S_VhsHsV4AaABAg,HuRpEA1sFow,2020-10-12T22:00:02Z,climate crisis

Joel Salatin says he gets 4 times as many cow days per acre as his neighbors do, and he uses no expensive inputs. He follows the cows with chickens a few days after the cows are moved, which spread the manure, and he makes money on the chickens both through eggs and meat.

How come so many farmers in conventional agriculture are committing suicide if it's so freaking profitable? When you're spending all your money on feed and chemical inputs, on heavy equipment and buildings, it's hard to make a profit. Greg Judy makes a great living raising cows and hair sheep on the same pasture, one helping the other as they eat different forage, and he has no tractors or barns, just electric fence that he can move when he moves the cattle every day. The only recurring expense he has once in a while is hay, and he doesn't use much of that since he manages his pastures so there's still grass just about all winter. 

It's not important for American farmers to feed the world. They don't now. They mainly grow corn, soybeans, and wheat. Most of the food the world's peoples eat is grown on small farms everywhere. It's much better to have smaller farmers feeding people close by than it is having huge farms producing meat that is neither as nutritious nor as delicious, not to mention less profitable.

What melted the last ice age?
What froze the last ice age?
Was not CO2,  it was the sun, orbit, volcanism, or comet or asteroid.
92% of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is simple water vapor.
Chemical energy got man into the Industrial Age.  Does oil and coal pollute you bet.  It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up.  Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors.  It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron.  Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid.  More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more.  Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%.

Even if it rains, the water flows off since there is little to no vegetation to absorb it into the soil.

I'm not sure how much I'd had in the way of ""organic"" as it's not something I've intentionally gone out of my way to find. 

Though once I rented an allotment for a small period of time and the vegetables from it were impressive. They were a lot sweater and tasted better than what I'd normally find in shops. The area was covered with weeds which we had to clear before planting, which may have improved the soil conditions as said in the video. I doubt anything other than water was fed to the crops as it was only me watering them as my friend were obsessed with some irrigation system they were procrastinating deeply on. I also went to some organic farm resturant with my family, but I didn't notice anything spectacular about it. I think I'm more interested in quantitive results rather than personal experience. Though it's a technique I'll likely try if I decide to start growing crops again. It's at least a good way to save on fertilizer.
