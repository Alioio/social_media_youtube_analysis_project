Forests are a source of oxygen that we breathe to survive. There will be many problems that arise if we continue to use the existing forest without replanting it. These problems are like the glass effect that arises from human activities that produce CO2 gas. If deforestation continues, no one absorbs CO2 further, the effect of these greenhouse gases cancels global fires which have an impact on glaciers, drought, forests, causing habitat for these animals to become extinct and causing the ecosystem on earth to become unbalanced.",UCVE0xQ7eHfe2Zqbjwmm50pQ,0.0,UgwWIniFvwZBbD4UDeB4AaABAg,Ic-J6hcSKa8,2017-08-21T17:00:03Z,climate change rainforest

Hutan juga menutupi sebagian dari planet bumi. Berdasarkan data yang diperoleh bahwa sebagian besar hewan, hutan merupakan tempat tinggal hewan dan tumbuhan. Terlebih lagi sebagian besar hewan di dunia hidup di daerah tropis. Tetapi dangan adanya defortasi  berakibat pada jumlah gas rumah kaca di atmosfer. yang dimana semakin sedikit hutan, berarti akan menyebabkan lebih banyak efek rumah kaca memasuki lapisan atmosfer.  terlebih lagi defortasi hutan dapat semakin berkurangnya keanekaragaman hayati.

Dari sini dapat diketahui bahwa dampak utama dari adanya deforestasi adalah terjadinya penurunan kualitas atmosfer. Deforestasi berkontribusi pada pemanasan global yang terjadi karena adanya peningkatan konsentrasi gas rumah kaca (greenhouse gases) yang menyebabkan kenaikan suhu udara global.",UCKOIeOSZwxiFJlQWtHUnPRQ,0.0,Ugxd1SuaW8z9GFtBnah4AaABAg,Ic-J6hcSKa8,2017-08-21T17:00:03Z,climate change rainforest

Seperti yang telah dikatakan dalam video tersebut, bahwa hutan adalah habitat atau tempat tinggal bagi 80% tumbuhan dan hewan . Penggundulan hutan dapat menimbulkan efek yang sangat luar biasa. Efek yang akibatkan penggundulan hutan yaitu emisi gas rumah kaca yang menyebabkan efek rumah kaca. Seperti yang kita ketahui, efek rumah kaca berkaitan erat dengan pemanasan global. Oleh karena itu, pemanasan global akan semakin bertambah tiap tahunnya. Selain itu, efek sampingnyalagi adalah kepunahan. Sekitar 4 sampai 6 ribu spesies telah punah akibat penggundulan hutan. Sehingga keanekaragaman hayati dalam hutan tidaklah seimbang. 

Forests are very important for the life of living things. As has been said in the video, that the forest is a place to live for 80% of plants and animals. Deforestation can have biggest effects. The effect from deforestation is the emission of greenhouse gases which causes the greenhouse effect. As we know, the greenhouse effect is closely related to global warming. Therefore, global warming will increase every year. Besides, another side effect is extinction. About 4 to 6 thousand species have become extinct due to deforestation.

It covers much of the planet's land, however deforestation has been consuming our forests and it brings a lot of unexpected effects and disasters on earth like global warming, flood etc. Deforestation is not the only problem made by humans. Throwing trash, cars, planes, thermo electric power stations and many others. 
People dont realise that this destroys our planet or they do realise but they dont care because they wont be here to see the destructions, but the next generations will.

The land is developed when you build infrastructure like roads, electricity, water pipes, sewage, build houses for people to rent or buy and pay the bills, or build companies to sell or produce or assemble their goods. Our society does not support woods and jungle, animal life or clean air. We topple nature by developing technology to destroy what's there from before, yet use the propaganda to convince others that more technology is the right way to meet nature.

Deforestation occurs when the land is converted from forest land into another landuse. This is primarily happening in second and third world where they lack other opportunities for national income such as manufacturing, tech, etc. So land is cleared and converted into other uses such as cattle or plantations. Modern forestry in developed countries is based on 100+ years of science and experience to ensure that we will have forests in perpetuity. There are third party certifications that allow you to see that the wood based products you are purchasing are sourced sustainably. Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) are two of the prominent ones.

The planet went throught temperatures way over anything climate change could ever cause, and way down what most animals and even plants could ever survive.
The interest in stopping climate change, preventing current species from going extinct and stopping things like deforestation is selfish, and purely for our own benefit. Which is why we need to redouble efforts. Even if you think you don't care about those, you tip the balance too much to the wrong side and the delicate ecossystem we depend on to live can come tumbling down just like it also happened for previous dominating species in past epochs. Because the planet isn't going anywhere, and it would recover plenty fast overtime. Specially without us. Faster without us. The only thing poised to dramatically change if we do nothing is our own survival.
We'll most likely not survive the next big natural mass extinction event anyways, better make good use and stretch things as long as we can by NOT killing ourselves with out own hands and actions. Who knows? We could have a few millenia to enjoy as long as we don't keep polluting and screwing around as much.
We're but a tiny tiny tiny blip in Earth's timeline. Grain of sand in a beach, spec of dust floating around Earth's in a nanosecond-like moment of it's life.
It's quite funny when you think that among the other animals who ruled the planet through long periods of time, we might end up being among the most short lived. Couple hundred thousand years is basically nothing in comparison to dinosaurs who might have been the dominant species for a good hundred million years. Which in turn is also nothing in comparison to Earth's approximate 4.5 billion years of age (as far as we know).",UCtX06T01ptrwu-tqdC6osFA,0.0,Ugzk56sujuIWoG_zt7F4AaABAg,Ic-J6hcSKa8,2017-08-21T17:00:03Z,climate change rainforest

A tropical forest is an ecosystem where clouds are created from evaporating water vapors from trees which then condense into rains that rejuvenate the forest. Those cloud covers created by rainforests help reflect heat from the sun which otherwise will be absorbed by the ground. Anybody familiar with tropical rainforests knows that it is much cooler under the forest canopy than when outside. Plantations created from vast tracts of rainforest cannot replicate these cycle of evaporations and condensations, hence deforestation of any form is destructive to this eco-system. 
You are correct that it is in the interest of logging companies to protect forest resources. The problem is short-sighted governments that see large logging companies as enemies of the forest. Well-organized logging companies are usually committed to reforestation and protecting the forest. But they cannot do that when governments cancel their logging license, which usually results in the demise of logging companies. Logging accesses are in most cases treated as private roads maintained and secured by logging companies. When the logging companies are gone, the roads are now wide open to illegal loggers, slash and burn farmers, charcoal makers and other characters who do not really care about government regulations or maintaining the forest. The result is massive deforestation.
The main engine in the rapid deforestation of tropical forest is the uncontrolled growth of the human population.
