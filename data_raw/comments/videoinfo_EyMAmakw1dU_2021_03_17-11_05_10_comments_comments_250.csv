In Netherlands about 10.000 km¬≤ area (26% of the total area of the country) is today below sea lvl so it is a expertise and main topic here. Wave erosion and climat sea level rise sometimes goes hand in hand the one does not exclude the other, often it is combined. Sea level measurement/monitoring today is done by satellite in centimeters (or for amerikans in inches). 99,9% sure and true measurement results. But there is old methode. <br /><br /><br />Make a pole cut marks in it nail it 6-8 feet in the ground (better in calm area so easy to read) in water close to the beach. Now 50 year test starts (sorry sea lvl rise is not a shorttherm projekt). Mark the levls with date every year. If the water comes up you will see it if you can count more down until sea ground it is erosion. Problem sometimes is lifting or sinking of the pole itself and weathering. Therefore below ground you need material with the density close to the density of your ground.
