This is where a certain opinion is imposed on everyone and it MUST be followed regardless of how weak the evidence for it is and despite how much various experts say otherwise. <br /><br />This kind of thing was tried in Russia when Lysenko dictated &quot;the science&quot; on the breeding of seeds for crops. The state supported him despite multiple experts saying that he was wrong. The USSR spent many years and wasted many lives because it followed Lysenko&#39;s beliefs.,UC7DNj9c1RB6mCIe9r7DOQ1Q,0,Ugzh3fRKbJp4udsrWcp4AaABAg,GGGTUSXeahk,2020-12-03 09:44:53
