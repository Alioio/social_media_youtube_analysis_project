The Little Ice Age (which was not a true ice age). It was a period of cooling that occurred after an especially massive tropical volcanic eruption in 1257, of the now-extinct Mount Samalas near Mount Rinjani, both in Lombok, Indonesia, followed by three smaller eruptions in 1268, 1275, and 1284. When a volcano erupts, its ash reaches high into the atmosphere and can spread to cover the whole earth. The ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation, leading to worldwide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption. Also emitted by eruptions is sulfur, in the form of sulfur dioxide gas. When it reaches the stratosphere, it turns into sulfuric acid particles, which reflect the sun's rays, further reducing the amount of radiation reaching Earth's surface.

The sea bottom of coastal waters off the West Coast alone are littered with the remains of hundreds of Indian villages. You can actually dive on some of them, and I have. Over thousands of years these Native Americans continuously moved their villages to higher ground as sea levels rose hundreds of feet at the end of the last Ice Age. After the Medieval Warm Period, during which the ice melted and allowed Vikings to explore, colonize and farm Ice Land and Greenland, sea levels again dropped several feet and glaciers again advanced during the Little Ice Age 1350-1880. I note that the during this period 65 million people died - world wide - as a result of the cold temps. After The Little Ice Age, sea levels again rose, on average, 1.5 mm per year. That has remained relatively constant not withstanding increasing amounts of CO2. The Global Warming Meme is about control of every human endeavor imaginable.

It was global cooling that drove the Vikings from thier homeland as it got too cold to farm and raise sheep in Norway. So they raided and settled new lands. It was the cooling that allowed them to travel to Greenland and supposedly as far as north America. The huns all I know could no longer live of the steppes in central asia and thus had to raid the west. Global cooling or warming will create migrants and disasters either way. That is the consequences of living in cities as we simply cant move them. Global warming is causing millions to be displaced in asia, most notably Bangladesh via flooding. Here in the southwest U.S we are burning up. I live in AZ and have lived in the sonoran desert all my life, the amount of rain has most definitely been disrupted for the worse. It will dry up this desert and turn it to rolling sand dunes, a total wasteland. However this may not be entirely global climate change affecting the rains but ourselves hurting the deserts ability to create massive thunderstorms. Removing desert landscape hurts precipitation which builds our monsoons that give us the ability to live here.

But when CO2 were 600ppm did life consist of only the life forms we find now, no.

If you as a chemist were to challenge that &quot;we have it on the books&quot; theory you would need a very large amount of evidence and would likely not be able to make an impact or even to get published if you HAD evidence. (you wouldn&#39;t even get funding to do the study in the first place so it would be pretty hard to get something off the ground). Keep in mind no one has &quot;SEEN&quot; an electron. Ever. It&#39;s a concept that explains a phenomenon.<br /><br />2. scientists don&#39;t get paid very well. It&#39;s a saturated field like a lot of others in this information era and 90% make the same or less as a trucker or carpenter. It&#39;s a geek-out obsession for most. Funding is built on publish publish publish and you can only do that by writing something that builds off something someone else did. The &quot;review&quot; process isn&#39;t much more than a club where a few other &quot;experts&quot; breeze your paper and if you cited them (good for their funding) then they the gatekeepers let you pass and publish your paper (good for your funding). The object of the science in my opinion is less about finding truth as it is a business of publishing, although some researchers are genuinely interested and working hard to find truth they are &lt;1%. <br /><br /><br />My overall advice would be don&#39;t take &quot;scientists&quot; too seriously.

From what I gather, this video is arguing that not as many scientists agree that global warming is an urgent and man- made problem. I am, however, missing the point to that argument. Low resolution thinking fails to address the IMPLICATIONS of this reachy conclusion, and does not bring anybody into helpful action. If one is arguing, say that the environment is fine and the IMPLICATION of that is that we are a society should continue to support fossil fuels and environmental de-regulation, then that point should be stated. <br /><br />Aside from principle, the content therein the argument is questionable. Even operating under the assumption that the majority of scientists did not think that this was a pressing issue and humans have had &quot;limited&quot; contribution (of which is entirely false if one does their own research), it makes no excuse for NOT striving for renewable energy and a cleaner planet. Even in the video it is unanimously agreed that pollution is a problem, CO2 is a harmful greenhouse gas, and that the climate is changing more rapidly than before. Given just these, why is it considered a negative thing to criticize and improve the actions of mankind? It is easy to see two arguments put plainly; the planet is not in danger and the harm we do to it does not have a significant impact and therefore no change should occur, or the planet is in danger in large because of humanity&#39;s impact and there is call for improvement of society to occur. It rather baffles me that arguments against improving society so that it is cleaner, healthier, and less harmful even exist. I am left only to wonder what agenda they adhere to, for it musn&#39;t surely be an agenda of productive righteousness and long term systems thinking. It would not be of a surprise to me if it is rather an agenda of short term, unsustainable monetary gain. <br /><br />Seriously people, wake up. Think critically, and put ideas into a larger context. Media like this is shameful and although well produced, demonstrated a low-resolution thinking that is harmful to society. I will give that the call of the video was to discuss the &quot;97%&quot; and that was achieved, but the lack of foresight for implication renders this argument on parallel with that of a defensive child who&#39;s being threatened to have their toys removed.",UC42PUfQse4p3SMDb8JBmoUg,0,UgzvxO4_DwvEtOQHwFR4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Current loss of arctic sea ice is resulting in a decrease in albedo, further warming the planet and resulting in the melting of permafrost in the high arctic barren lands. Permafrost is currently holding large amounts of methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas. If this is released we will see accelerated warming. This could effect plants ability to remove carbon from the air (check out the link below) I think it&#39;s important to consider humans have evolved during an icehouse earth, the Quaternary ice age with its glacial and interglacial cycles. and it is an unnerving question as to whether we would thrive in a greenhouse earth. Reducing our carbon footprint has to be a priority of any responsible public policy. In fact emerging technologies which remove carbon from the atmosphere should be funded and pursued aggressively. Personally I believe nuclear power needs to be reexamined as an energy dense supply for world economies.

The problem is people are not taking different variables even scientists are starting to realize this is not what is causing global warming the do you forget that we have volcanoes that are active currently or did we just forget oh that can't be the reason carbon-14 is apparent but nobody talks about that and that's natural from Earth from animals no one can really tell but they're saying animals can't be the Earth no no no it can't be that we don't need to change what we drive everyday to essentially get ripped off by people that are cunning a lot of other people to believe in such foolishness that should be a big wow!!! And if you haven't noticed the temperatures have dropped stop by a lot but they have just like it did in the 80s late 80s to early 90s it was hot for a for 5 years and then it started to cool down a little bit with all the factories going on with all the cars driving around it somehow cool down how did that happen explain that. And when we really don't have anything to refer it to that's dangerous now you're playing games with people's ideas on what is clean energy not realizing there are probably dangerous consequences that are going on that is slightly different than what people are going on bantering about green energy being the Savior when there's an underlying problem that could be working behind this weather events that doesn't have anything to do with driving cars that are gas powered so what is the other alternative problems that might be the issue I'm going with volcanoes for the past 2 years I have been noticing a lot of activities especially with volcanoes as of late should we be concerned on what we drive or should we be more concerned with what the volcanoes are doing it's an honest question?,UCk7oHYGcUgJiGrz3TPLps_Q,1,Ugz6MCAR0iZz1AB8FbZ4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I am a skeptic as far as man's effect on our climate goes. Apart from your own personal, actual life experiences, you know nothing.

As you get older ( you will discover this ) you learn that all one is being told, albeit by specialists/ scientists/ economists et al, is not necessarily true. Doubt creeps in and one then becomes unsure of who to believe. That is where I am at. Since the 1970's, when we are first told of the coming disasters of global warming, I rushed to put a house brick into the cistern of my toilet to reduce my water usage. This was vital according to the soothsayers of the day. We were going to run out of water. Now they say we are going to drown as the ice caps are melting. You see my dilemma ? The narrative change to a New Ice Age then to Global Warming. Now it is covered by all encompassing Climate Crisis. Further, the effort put into this 'crisis' across the globe over that last 50 years has gad no beneficial effect whatsoever. Things are getting worse ( we are told ). This leads me to deduce that man's effect on our planet, as far as climate goes, is inconsequential, as whatever we have done so far has actually made things worse.

(For instance the Thames had not frozen since 1814 except once in 1963 though parts of it just did again, whereas it froze regularly during the Little Ice Age.) But I reject the idea that we've measured that warming to a decimal place. How on Earth do we know the temperature of the Earth in 1880? Who was measuring it, how, where and how regularly? So 3) I dispute the claim that two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975. Indeed I claim that it is mathematically fatuous, because it amounts to saying that we know the Earth warmed by 0.26 degrees between 1880 and 1975 which is a rounding error not a measurement. And then that it warmed by 0.54 degrees since 1975. And again, I defy you to explain how we know the Earth's temperature even in 1975 to within a degree, let alone in 1934 or 1880 or 49 BC. Who was measuring it in Borneo, Irkutsk or the middle of the South Atlantic? 4) The ""average rate of ice-age-recovery warming"" is again something we just don't know. We know temperature did some strange stuff around the Younger Dryas, or think we do, rising and falling further and faster than anything we've seen in the thermometer era. But all of this stuff is built on claims to knowledge of the Earth's temperature going back a century and then 12k years that are completely and I would say rather obviously unfounded.",UC_egdS4871949youPFyvW_A,1,UgwAUlx4pWr6NalXFb54AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Contemporaries in physics dismissed the hypothesis as faulty -- you know, guys like James Maxwell. <br /><br />The hypothesis was fully disproven by 1917 when Einstein published his famous &#39;The Quantum Theory of Radiation&#39;. This groundbreaking paper mathematically demonstrated that the direction of molecules in motion must be considered for their absorptivity of light, as well as the momentum of the light itself. It predicted that if a gas molecule and an incident photon are moving in opposite directions, then it would be a violation of the Laws of Thermodynamics for that gas molecule to absorb the photon and increase in energy. Instead, Einstein surmised the concept of stimulated emission, that if the momentum of the gas molecule and incident light were in opposite directions, the interaction of the two would cause the gas molecule to emit two photons in the same direction as the incident light, thus cooling by that energy level instead of increasing. This was proven with the advent of the laser. The theory later led to the prediction that in a highly controlled experiment, light could cool gases to near absolute zero and create a new phase of matter which was dubbed Bose-Einstein condensate, which was later achieved in 1995. These factual demonstrations of Einstein&#39;s Quantum Theory of Radiation basically make it a law of physics, and trump the resurged back radiation hypothesis. <br /><br />Tyndall&#39;s original experiments showing the absorptivity of certain gases to infrared light were done in tubes filled completely with those gases at far higher pressures than they naturally exist in the atmosphere. If you completely fill a tube with enough molecules of those gases, then the probabilities of certain wavelengths of incident light transmitting freely through those tubes reduces to near zero, and that is all Tyndall&#39;s experiments showed.",UCy-57V-0NDV73qozYuOPmQA,0,Ugzh-cePEILzh4Kv47J4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

So if you put something hot next to something cold, the hot thing won't get hotter, and the cold thing won't get colder. So,skeptics tells us that, because the air, including the greenhouse gasses, is cooler than the surface of the Earth, it cannot warm the Earth. If it did, they say, that means heat would have to flow from cold to hot, in apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The skeptic is ignoring the fact that the Earth is being warmed by the sun, which makes all the difference. Now consider the blanket that keeps you warm. If your skin feels cold, wrapping yourself in a blanket can make you warmer. Why? Because your body is generating heat, and that heat is escaping from your body into the environment. When you wrap yourself in a blanket, the loss of heat is reduced, some is retained at the surface of your body, and you warm up. You get warmer because the heat that your body is generating cannot escape as fast as before. If you put the blanket on a tailors dummy, which does not generate heat, it will have no effect. The dummy will not spontaneously get warmer. The heat always flows from warm to cold – just more or less effectively. The processes of heat transfer are quite different – for the blanket it is mainly heat conduction, for the greenhouse effect it is thermal radiation. The climate deniers claim that the colder atmosphere cannot radiate thermal radiation towards the warmer surface. This is of course nonsense. The cool Earth also sends thermal radiation towards the hot sun – how would thermal radiation leaving Earth know how warm the surface is that it’s going to hit? It’s just that the sun sends more radiation back to us – the net flow is from hot to cold. More is not implied by the second law of thermodynamics.",UCMUhn-avHNDXnifASSsGn3Q,1,Ugzh-cePEILzh4Kv47J4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

The internet makes it possible for posers, anti-science drama queens, and morons to outnumber real scientists 1,000 to 1. The volume of that noise doesn&#39;t make any of those &quot;informed doubters&quot; the slightest bit right. Thanks to *ssholes preying on innocent followers looking for something positive to latch on to, you can probably bet your house and the future of grandchildren around the world that nature&#39;s tipping point will occur unabated in the next few years. If you include the reluctance of misinformed society to do the right thing as part of nature, the tipping point has already occurred. Most doubters today will know for absolute certain within their lifetimes that failure to support real science screwed their kids and grandkids out of a reasonable future. It&#39;s not that some form of retreat to the poles can&#39;t happen for a few million survivors of large-scale crop failures, it&#39;s that the probability that any will survive inevitable wars over evaporating resources is low. What this means is that every kid born after, say, 2015, knows, or will know that previous generations not only borrowed trillions from them before they were even born, but also elected to pass along a dying, unrepairable environment.<br /><br />Look up NASA data on CO2 emission over the past 50 years. Look up tipping points in physical systems. Look up the fact that each large, unregulated shipping container ship burning bunker oil pumps more crap into the air than 50 million cars. Realize that human population is adding an entire New York City&#39;s worth of new souls each year and think about that level of consumption. You can actually do the fundamental probabilities yourselves: If CO2 is a greenhouse gas that remains stable in the atmosphere for thousands of years without a sufficient number of plants to break down the molecules into oxygen and absorb the carbon, then what do you know about the sufficient number of plants if the CO2 levels keep climbing? That&#39;s right! There haven&#39;t been enough plants to reabsorb the output of billions of industrialize humans for more than 50 years. You don&#39;t need to know the exact number of plants required, only that if CO2 levels keep spiking, it means whatever used to absorb it is overwhelmed. If there were only 200 million humans on earth living like suburban Americans with SUVs, there&#39;d be no problem. 8 billion clamoring to live like Americans: extinction level event for most life on earth.",UCz_icy79LavEQswz9N54fQg,0,UgyrA0lZj8ogijZnUit4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Sawyer argued for a climate sensitivity – how much long-term warming will occur per doubling of atmospheric CO2 levels – of 2.4C, which is not too far off the best estimate of 3C used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) today.

When science funding is dependent on results, it corrupts the science. When the funding, stature and tenure is based on alignment with consensus, it will corrupt some scientists. The corrupted science undermines the credibility of the proper science and as a result we all lose.

Petroleum gives us a rich source of products used in plastics, medicine and other materials.

One medical researcher, Dr Barry Marshall, thought otherwise and suggested that they were caused by certain bacteria and with a colleague showed this to be the case in 1983. The establishment consensus-toting scientists summarily dismissed this demonstrated evidence and wrote published papers on how he was wrong. Dr Marshall literally had to infect himself with these bacteria and give himself peptic ulcers for the medical establishment to admit they were wrong. It took them 22 years to admit they were wrong despite the evidence which dismissed the long held 'beliefs'. I could present many examples of how the 'real scientists' were nothing but a bunch of sheep. I have an M.S. and can tell you first hand that most ""scientists"" are merely sheep that write their quota of consensus science papers and then decide what's for lunch.

The Little Ice Age coincided with the Maunder Minimum of the sun where virtually no sunspots were counted for 50 years and the decades surrounding it were also relatively weak. Solar activity increased slightly but became relatively very active over the time of observations in just the last century, from 1920-2011, this is called the Modern Maximum. It was just the last solar cycle, #24, that was relatively weak but still as active as 1880-1920. Expecting immediate cooling from just 11 years of relatively lower solar activity is like expecting a freight train to come to a stop immediately if the power is decreased to the wheels. But it is more complicated than that, because a freight train's speed is a simple linear system mostly dependent on the energy turning the wheels, whereas the climate is among the most complex dynamic systems we have ever studied. Ocean cycles have oscillations and cycles of decades to millennium, not to mention the hundreds of other variables all in play. A short period of warming or cooling in a complex dynamic system therefore cannot be easily explained by just contemporary changes in variables - climate is a non linear system with variables spanning thousands of years. Here's an example of a linear system and then the complexity of adding just ONE more variable to the system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U39RMUzCjiU",UCy-57V-0NDV73qozYuOPmQA,1,UgyHYLnfea05GRnHOct4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Oh CO2, that makes up .05%, is a small fraction of the greenhouse gases that is good for plants, and the one that actually LAGS the historical temperature changes in the atmosphere. Oh, that one.

Today, the average temperature is +15C. Within 50 years the average temperature would drop to -21C without the warming provided by atmospheric carbon dioxide. The delicate link between the planet's temperature and carbon dioxide has also been proved by geologic records of CO2 levels during ice ages and interglacial periods. The temperature difference between an ice age period and an interglacial period is only 5°C. During previous ice ages, CO2 levels were near 180 parts per million (ppm). During the warm interglacial periods the levels were near 280 ppm. Today we are living in an interglacial period that started 12,000 years ago and may last another 40,000 years.

Current atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are about 30% higher than they were about 150 years ago at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Before the industrial revolution, the CO2 content in the air remained quite steady for thousands of years. Natural CO2 is not static, however. It is generated by natural processes, and absorbed by others. But consider what happens when more CO2 is released from outside of the natural carbon cycle – by burning fossil fuels. Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2 is at its highest level in millions of years.

822,UgwCqkjcdDgVmWEV-yV4AaABAg,0.0,0,2021-02-10 18:17:41,The Auto Channel,"This is an excellent video. My own recollection of the claim about the 97% Consensus is this:<br /><br />A decade or two ago, some global warming alarmist floated the comment that &quot;97% of all scientists believe in global warming.&quot; The comment was made in the frivolous manner that one person might make at a party; something like &quot;Oh everybody loves it.&quot;<br /><br />As the frivolous comment got passed around by alarmist, the deniers rebuked the comment for what it was, simply an exaggerated off-the-cuff remark with no foundation. I was one of these deniers. On the denier side, we had an actual petition signed by over 30,000 &quot;scientists&quot; who stated their opposition to the claim of man-made global warming/cooling. (SEE: http://www.petitionproject.org) <br /><br />I always used this petition in this way: &quot;If there are 30,000 scientists who have signed their names in disagreement, where is the document with 970,000 scientists who claim that man-made climate change is happening?&quot; Needless to say, no one ever came forth with such a document. <br /><br />To try to validate the 97% claim, alarmists then tried other tactics to make the claim accurate. One such study was an online search for published articles (or all types) that mentioned the words or term &quot;climate change&quot; ad perhaps &quot;global warming.&quot; If I remember correctly, there were about 10,000 results. The results weren&#39;t all &quot;papers&quot; as in scientific study papers, many were just articles and editorials. The results fell in three categories: Those items that agree with &quot;climate change,&quot; those that didn&#39;t agree with &quot;climate change,&quot; and those that didn&#39;t offer any opinion (they just reported on the argument). A very large part of the results fell in the &quot;no opinion&quot; category. Another large part fell in the &quot;agree&quot; category, and a small part of the results fell in the &quot;deny or disagree&quot; category.<br /><br />The &quot;researchers&quot; who put the online search together disqualified the results that offered no specific opinion one way or the other - they just reported on the argument. They then further massaged the results a bit to remove some results because they claimed they weren&#39;t from &quot;scientific&quot; people or entities. These &quot;researchers&quot; were able to now say that about 90% or a little higher were agreeing that climate change was real. However, in reporting this study, and using it to try to validate the generalized 97% consensus, the &quot;researchers&quot; stated that the study was based on 10,000 results in order to give their claim some weight.<br /><br />The actual numbers were something like 52% of all the results were of the opinion that &quot;man-made climate change&quot; was real; 5-10% of the results were of the opinion that there was &quot;no man-made climate change;&quot; and roughly 40% expressed no opinion one way or the other. I would agree that if 52% of all published scientific papers claimed that the phenomenon is real that it is an interesting statistic to note. <br /><br />However, there&#39;s a few significant problems with this. Firstly, 52% is not 97%, and it represents a far greater difference of opinion than the alarmists would like the world to know. Second, the argument to be made is the argument that &quot;man-made climate change is happening.&quot; Therefore the greatest amount of papers/editorials/articles to be written and published would come from people who have something to gain by popularizing the event. The vast majority of the community would have nothing to gain and therefore would not go out of their way to write a paper/editorial/article that denies climate change; they would simply stand on the historic and scientific fact that climate is cyclical. And third, &quot;consensus&quot; is not proof or facts. For instance, water doesn&#39;t boil at sea level at 212 degrees F (100 C) because of scientific consensus, it boils at that temperature because that is the effect that occurs when water is actually and factually heated to 212 F. The 52% consensus would still have to prove that the climate is unnaturally changing, that it is changing because of man-made actions, and that the actions will result in some type of unusual catastrophic result. As of today, there is no scientific proof that of any of this, there is simply conjecture.<br /><br />In further support of my position I submit these items for your perusal:<br /><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/12/the-coming-revelation-of-the-global-warming-fraud-resembles-the-obamacare-lie/?sh=570ecf6d35c9"">https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/12/the-coming-revelation-of-the-global-warming-fraud-resembles-the-obamacare-lie/?sh=570ecf6d35c9</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2013/05/30/global-warming-alarmists-caught-doctoring-97-percent-consensus-claims/?sh=642a92d485dd"">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2013/05/30/global-warming-alarmists-caught-doctoring-97-percent-consensus-claims/?sh=642a92d485dd</a>",UCPeEwa964MHKgjZxD66Qlrg,0,UgwCqkjcdDgVmWEV-yV4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

To say there is no consensus is ridiculous. 195 sovereign states and from J.

Usually it is not mentioned because the models have trouble with this time period. (Often leading to suggestions of non-linear release of ocean heat.) The difficulty lies not in that one person's prediction differs between 3.0 and 2.6, it is whether or not the effect measured was due to that or other factors. Other factors might have produced the warming. If a normal peak is 300ppm, and we are a little over 400ppm, then the actual increase is 33.3%. (And we are near the end of a 100,000 year cycle where a peak is expected.) In any case, one would not like to think of the effect of doubling the CO2, which oscillates between 175 and 300 ppm over vast time scales, but is shockingly high right now. Be aware that the measurements of CO2 from long ago are less accurate than measurements taken over the few hundred years we have had direct equipment. (As opposed to ice cores, etc.) I find it interesting, but not at all unusual, to find the CO2 has similar cycles to global temperatures. It might lead one to conclude that there is a feedback loop where warmer temperatures cause plant life to convert more O2, and colder temperatures reduce the plant conversion to increase the CO2, having a regulatory effect. I would guess we should reduce cutting down forests, particularly without any replacement policy. What worries me is if those of us in more developed countries are using a period of warming to justify restrictions which would preclude less developed countries from catching up. This is why I am sensitive to the political aspect being so divergent from the scientific. We have no way of knowing right now if the cooling starting in 2000 is the 100,000 year cycle coming to and end, which would argue that AGW is abated, but much worse, or if it is an oscillation due to underdamped response, and thus AGW is trivial.",UCNEt8PQ8nITwzbIGBdyytiw,1,UgwMynmrzpGx_IGjAIl4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I do mathematical modeling as part of my job and am intricately familiar with both the modeling and the solution engines which compute them. That is why I am critical of the process because I do understand very clearly how modeling works. They do provide a wide range of estimates, and if you look back at the decades of modelling what I see from the data is that the estimates that track performance with minimal error predict little warming from human produced greenhouse gasses, and those that have large errors do predict it. In fact, overpredict it. Both sides of the debate use skewed data and selected results to bolster their extreme positions. While there is a political consensus, there is no scientific consensus since most of the 97% number is fantasy. The survey was self-selective, and most of the respondents did not take the extreme position. Of the few climate scientists who responded, most are funded to produce global warming results. What I focus on are the models used to predict climate for risk assessment such as crops (too much or too little rain), extreme weather, etc. where the person is paid to produce accurate results, and gets paid less when they are wrong. I truly do not have a political bias; if the most accurate models predicted a huge effect I would simply say so. The fact that quite a few individuals have positioned themselves to make billions off climate change extremism, particularly off 'cap and trade', does concern me since wealth corrupts science all the time. In fact, the warming trend reversed in the 2000s, and has oscillated since then. If you look at the plots it seems as if the 100,000 year cycle is coming near the 10,000 cycle and there is a chance of another little ice age. I feel it is this transition phase that is causing a great deal of problems since it seems to oscillate. This is referred to as an underdamped system. Another concern is whether the models produce this underdamped response, or whether the simulation engine is not tuned correctly. This latter effect happens quite often and there are people who get false simulation results, but it is the result they were hoping for, and do not dig into the convergence/fit issues.",UCNEt8PQ8nITwzbIGBdyytiw,1,UgwMynmrzpGx_IGjAIl4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Your argument has no validity or merit, and you clearly do not understand what a model is for - it 'models' climatic developments given all sorts of different factors and parameters. When models are run, the range of conclusions will be wide, and some will even model a regional or global cooling. The infrequency of such results when compared to the main body of results makes them exceptions or outliers, and it is disingenuous to quote from them, as it is to quote from crackpot 'scientists' (also outliers) or as many do, from organisations funded by the oil and coal industry.

The way I heard it, 97% of the published scientific papers over the period of study supported climate change caused by human activity. A paper about rising amounts of greenhouse gas released by cattle on ever-growing feedlots tells of human contribution to global warming, but the scientist was not focused on whether this was contributing to global warming, though it was clearly about human activity. <br />The speaker focuses on surveys of scientists. Surveys are not scientific studies; they can be worded to bias results towards a desired conclusion. As stated above, many scientists aren&#39;t focused on the global picture of climate change. But the clams of climate change with human contribution have been supported in petitions signed by over 1000 scientists who do focus on that. <br />Finally, the urgency comes from the need to limit warming NOW. The melting permafrost is already releasing large amounts of methane, and in a few places large amounts of carbon from underseas stores is beginning to escape. The increasing temperatures are melting the permafrost and destabilizing the undersea carbon. We underestimate the effects that climate change is having because we do not experience first hand the changing climate in the arctic.",UCYQfdZH3ZqcFz1VZVgjmiFQ,0,UgzPl8gUSfsbVyRSJ9d4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Isotopes are simply different atoms with the same chemical behavior but with different masses. Carbon is composed of three different isotopes, 14C, 13C and 12C. 12C is the most common. 13C is about 1% of the total. 14C accounts for only about 1 in 1 trillion carbon atoms. CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels or burning forests has quite a different isotopic composition from CO2 in the atmosphere. This is because plants have a preference for the lighter isotopes (12C vs. 13C); thus they have lower 13C/12C ratios. Since fossil fuels are ultimately derived from ancient plants, plants and fossil fuels all have roughly the same 13C/12C ratio – about 2% lower than that of the atmosphere. As CO2 from these materials is released into, and mixes with, the atmosphere, the average 13C/12C ratio of the atmosphere decreases.",UCTa-JmBRsnO3CPm1hHE2URA,1,Ugw9RyNHG_FLnD_sXH94AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

This video does a great disservice to the most credible science organizations that are doing the research and making recommendations to their respective governments that has led to the various climate accords, agreements such as Kyoto and the 2015 Paris agreement.

A period of mountain-building was also underway (the so-called Taconic orogeny) increasing the amount of rock weathering taking place and subsequently lowering CO2 levels even further. The evidence is definitely there for a short-term disruption of the carbon cycle. Another important factor is the sun. During the Ordovician, it would have been several percent dimmer according to established nuclear models of main sequence stars. Surprisingly, this raises the CO2 threshold for glaciation to a staggering 3000 ppmv or so. This also explains (along with the logarithmic forcing effect of CO2) why a runaway greenhouse didn't occur: with a dimmer sun, high CO2 is necessary to stop the Earth freezing over. In summary, we know CO2 was probably very high coming into the Late Ordovician period, however the subsequent dip in CO2 was brief enough not to register in the GEOCARB model, yet low enough (with the help of a dimmer sun) to trigger permanent ice-formation. Effectively it was a brief excursion to coldness during an otherwise warm era, due to a coincidence of conditions.",UCTa-JmBRsnO3CPm1hHE2URA,1,UgwXSZ3_jvJC2mKbgdV4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Writing late at night and on a small phone I apologise for any mistakes, oh and for saying ‘ stick to the history’. As to my credentials, I have planned and installed projects that have saved over 3 million tonnes of CO2 from being pumped into the atmosphere. With regards to the economic support argument, the fossil fuel industry receives huge amounts of financial support from governments all over the world. The largest subsidizers in 2015 were China ($1.4 trillion), United States ($649 billion), Russia ($551 billion), European Union ($289 billion), and India ($209 billion).2 May 2019 https://www.imf.org › 2019/05/02 Global Fossil Fuel Subsidies Remain Large: Why do we need to subsidise the fossil fuel industry ? On the climate debate, take ExxonMobil for example, it was found that the company’s knowledge of climate change dates back to July 1977, when its senior scientist James Black delivered a sobering message on the topic. “In the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels,"" Black told Exxon’s management committee. A year later he warned Exxon that doubling CO2 gases in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by two or three degrees—a number that is consistent with the scientific consensus today. He continued to warn that “present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical."" In other words, Exxon needed to act.",UCMZOidIfGfS00-lVnSmGHNg,1,UgzPBiYdXtyXLI988xR4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Remember, the studies u cite here might be biased or otherwise compromised to varying degrees. Humans are obviously not the only ones who interact with the atmosphere, there are both terrestrial and celestial causes and effects, but I&#39;m convinced the environment has evolved in a way likely or most DEFINITELY caused by increased CO2 emissions.

Such assumptions are indefensible.

So if you put something hot next to something cold, the hot thing won't get hotter, and the cold thing won't get colder. So,skeptics tells us that, because the air, including the greenhouse gasses, is cooler than the surface of the Earth, it cannot warm the Earth. If it did, they say, that means heat would have to flow from cold to hot, in apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The skeptic is ignoring the fact that the Earth is being warmed by the sun, which makes all the difference. Now consider the blanket that keeps you warm. If your skin feels cold, wrapping yourself in a blanket can make you warmer. Why? Because your body is generating heat, and that heat is escaping from your body into the environment. When you wrap yourself in a blanket, the loss of heat is reduced, some is retained at the surface of your body, and you warm up. You get warmer because the heat that your body is generating cannot escape as fast as before. If you put the blanket on a tailors dummy, which does not generate heat, it will have no effect. The dummy will not spontaneously get warmer. The heat always flows from warm to cold – just more or less effectively. The processes of heat transfer are quite different – for the blanket it is mainly heat conduction, for the greenhouse effect it is thermal radiation. The climate deniers claim that the colder atmosphere cannot radiate thermal radiation towards the warmer surface. This is of course nonsense. The cool Earth also sends thermal radiation towards the hot sun – how would thermal radiation leaving Earth know how warm the surface is that it’s going to hit? It’s just that the sun sends more radiation back to us – the net flow is from hot to cold. More is not implied by the second law of thermodynamics. And when you talk of Earths irregular orbit you are talking about the Milankovitch cycles. Earth's orbit around the sun is not fixed. It varies in its distance from the sun (eccentricity), the angle of the earth's rotation (obliquity)and the earth's wobble (precession). You can google ""the Milankovitch cycles"" for more info. Isn't science fascinating? The Milankovitch cycles drive the ice ages but his takes thousands of years. This in no way explains the rapid warming the Earth is now seeing. As the Earth moved out of ice ages over the past million years, the global temperature rose a total of 4 to 7 degrees Celsius over about 5,000 years. In the past century alone, the temperature has climbed 0.7 degrees Celsius, roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.",UCTa-JmBRsnO3CPm1hHE2URA,1,UgzXtVcWwk08ku_8dYN4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

While atmospheric gases (of which CO2 is less than 4%) are trapping radiation that emanates from the planet, they can’t and don't send it back into the planet. The most they can do is warm the air a bit, something akin to attempting to warm a bathtub full of water with (as many as you want) portable room heaters. Irrefutably, the greenhouse effect of CO2 is logarithmic, not linear or exponential. Hence it is only possible for CO2 to increase global warming by perhaps another 0.2 degrees Celsius, no matter how much higher the concentration of the trace gas, carbon dioxide. The big drivers of climate change are all the types of radiative energy from the sun . . . affecting ocean currents, the jet stream, and the like. The sun itself is more than 7000 times more potent than any effect carbon dioxide could conceivably have, even though the sun's energy output varies considerably. Notably it is now in a Grand Solar Minimum, its lowest energy output in two centuries.

New plant factories in the Netherlands (53°N) are able to compete with agriculture in the tropics to produce our food in a fraction of the space and with a fraction of the water required by conventional agriculture.<br /><br />Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg"">https://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw"">https://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw"">https://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw</a><br /><br />See examples of working plant factories<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk"">https://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ"">https://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ</a><br /><br />Use cattle herds to revitalise soil<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI"">https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI</a><br /><br />Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo"">https://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo</a> <br /><br />Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo"">https://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU"">https://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU</a><br /><br />Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4"">https://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4</a><br /><br />Use minerals to assist salmon populations <br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation</a><br /><br />Don’t be misanthropic.

OK, here's a chunk of a reading I give my university classes. 5) OK, but how does more CO2 in the air make the Earth warmer? The average temperature of the Earth is around 59 degrees Fahrenheit, but if there were no greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, the Earth’s average temperature would drop to around zero (Fahrenheit). But how exactly do more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases make the Earth warmer? All day every day, the Earth is bombarded with light energy from the sun. Not all of it reaches the surface, but when it does, that light energy gets transformed into heat energy or infrared radiation. It you have ever stood barefoot on a blacktop surface on a hot summer day, you can feel how that light energy has been transformed into lots of heat. But heat rises, so that heat or thermal energy starts to rise higher and higher, heading for outer space. But the air is filled with lots of molecules, and in every cubic meter of air there are molecules of CO2 floating around. If thermal energy of the right wavelengths hits a CO2 molecule, that molecule absorbs that heat energy but re-radiates that energy in all directions. So now, instead of all that heat rising straight towards outer space, most of it has been re-radiated outwards from the molecule in a different direction—some upwards but not straight up, some sideways, some downwards, and only a tiny amount straight up. This process, repeated over and over again as thermal energy encounters CO2 molecules as it rises towards space, slows down the loss of heat from the sun to outer space. Holding that heat in the atmosphere longer makes it warmer than Earth would be otherwise. Thus, adding more CO2 to the atmosphere is like adding a blanket to your bed on a cold night—the blanket makes you warmer not by creating its own heat but by keeping the heat from your body closer to your body for longer. 6) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before—just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. (see the links after #13) 7) Furthermore, after human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler—just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would. This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. (see the links after #13) 8) Moreover, after human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate (which slows the escape of heat to the atmosphere and makes the Earth warmer). Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. (see the links after #13) 9) In parallel, as human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. This was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. (see the links after #13) 10) Despite a massive and well-funded propaganda campaign and widespread misinformation about this point, many models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted how much additional CO2 would cause how much additional global warming with impressive accuracy. The models work. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL085378 11) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all or virtually of recent net warming, whether you go back 20 years, 40 years, 60 years, 100 years, or 150 years. To put it differently, over any time span you choose to go back from now, if it were not for human activity, the Earth would have either cooled slightly, stayed the same temperature, or for a few time spans, warmed just a tiny bit. A chart on Wikipedia’s web page illustrates clearly how the effect of natural drivers on global temperatures is overwhelmed by the effects of human drivers of global temperatures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming 12) Contrary to misinformation from AGW (anthropogenic global warming) skeptics, SEVEN different articles have all found that 90% or more of practicing climate scientists agree that human activity is significantly warming the planet. See all three levels of information: https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm The scientists most likely to deny man-made global warming and climate disruption are those whose paychecks depend on us continuing to burn fossil fuels (e.g., geologists working for oil companies) or people whose political beliefs make it difficult to face the economic consequences of admitting that man-made global warming is real and a serious threat: https://skepticalscience.com/Geologists-climate-change-denial.html 13) Taken together, ALL those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels (and other greenhouse-gas producing activities [deforestation, cement production]). In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, plus you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All or virtually all recent warming and climate disruption is due to human activities that increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, making cement) and that reduced the Earth’s ability to sequester carbon (deforestation). To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level of the first link: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Take care.",UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw,1,UgxMxrzc9M5r4p-Bd9d4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

On the once hand, it doesn't matter that much from an evidentiary perspective if people who have no expertise in the mechanisms of global warming and cooling don't believe we caused global warming when the folks with real expertise overwhelmingly said we did. That's like mechanical engineers disputing a statement on the mechanics of mitochondria published by leading cell biologists--who cares what the folks who don't know what they are talking about believe? The chain of evidence is damning. My second response is that is simply not true: Unless you have some compelling data to prove otherwise, the figure is not 10%.

US politicians lack the brainpower to grasp that the US contributes only about 14% of the world&#39;s manmade CO2. Even if the US stopped all CO2 production, throwing us back basically to the 1800&#39;s, it would hardly reduce the world&#39;s total manmade CO2 production. <br /> <br />The rest of the world isn&#39;t automatically going to follow the US down the path to pre-technology energy consumption levels. Rather, they would eagerly embrace and encourage energy burning companies to flee the US and set up shop in their countries, most likely with less pollution controls. The net effect of this would be to increase total manmade CO2 while at the same time severely reducing the standard of living in the US. <br /> <br />Politicians aren&#39;t scientists. Most of them are neither educated enough nor smart enough to grasp basic science.

The same rise in temperature of the global warming trend. If you notice, the resulting rise can only be changed by a volume EQUAL to the original volume.<br /><br />Now, let&#39;s look at the increase in volume of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. It&#39;s gone from 280 PPM to 400 PPM. or 0.022% of the original volume.That&#39;s 4,545 times smaller that the volume of the atmosphere.

If Carbon dioxide participates in the global warmup cycle, it must increase in temperature and it will inevitably become hotter and lighter. All Co2 molecules which become lighter will climb higher. That is inevitable. So, if the earth really gets up to some insane temperature level, it will climb so high that the solar wind will remove all the hottest CO2 gas molecules much faster and the equilibrium will come back swiftly. That is precisely exactly what has been going on for years. CO2 is our global Freon. Its use is to collect the heat and let the solar wind remove the excess heat from our planet. That is its function. Our planet is abundant with carbon, so there is little chance that it will run out soon. The bottom of the ocean has immense amounts of carbon. The idea that sunlight must find its way out and CO2 is preventing it, is as puerile as could be. No real scientist will stand behind the idea that there is no upper limit to CO2&#39;s temperature to evaporate into space. If there is too much CO2 the hottest part of the CO2 will be swept away and that will reduce the temperature efficiently allowing radiation to escape faster into space. We have an air-conditioning system on our planet. And it is tight in its function to actively maintain the balance. That means if heat is coming in faster, more and more carbon will climb and take a trip to explore space. Airconditioning is explained in Physics 101. Only folks who have no experience in rigorous science will jump on the Global Warming agenda.",UC6i4USKM3LP8z_qCPg2l3Vg,0,Ugz209s5dJsQ7h0oEWp4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

These gases are not warming up itself or surrounding molecules. These are all molecules with three atoms that have specific vibrations that reflect infrared parts of the Albedo, which is the reflection of radiation from Earth to Space. In addition, the land and sea also release infrared radiation towards space which is reflected by climate gases. Due to the vibration of these gas molecules, the infrared radiation that is supposed to go from the earth into space is reflected (again) and returned to earth. That causes the additional warming. And carbon dioxide is neither going up nor escaping into space in amounts that need to be mentioned. Occasionally single molecules or atoms can leave the Exosphere when reaching the Escape velocity. This might happen if, for example, two parts of Hydrogen collide. Most parts from the Exosphaere are not going into space but get attracted by the gravitation of the moon while in the Exosphere if the Moon's orbit is closest to the Earth.",UCd5ir2iY8dfBjvRwx59suXw,1,Ugz209s5dJsQ7h0oEWp4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

There's a gas called carbon dioxide which is able to reflect the infrared radiation and can be used to regulate the temperature. If there was no carbon dioxide, the average temperature on this planet would be minus 18 degrees centigrade, which means it would be too cold for humans and many animals. Therefore Nature released a certain amount of carbon dioxide to regulate our climate, and the not needed carbon dioxide was divided into carbon and oxide and the carbon put deep into the earth so no stupid animal would release it and confuse the climate. Then a very stupid animal called the human appeared and started to dig out the carbon as coal, oil, and gas and to burn it into carbon dioxide without realizing that this will increase the planet's temperature.",UCd5ir2iY8dfBjvRwx59suXw,1,Ugx6-jLoUyKW6k1Kxn94AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

It has to do with rate of change and the relationships of different elements in the scenario. As I understand it we have about 4 major crops: wheat, soybeans, cotton and something else let's say, and the growing conditions for any or all of these may change due to human intervention, labelled 'climate change', which in turn may alter other characteristics of that plants life cycle which would or could change drastically, perhaps decreasing the overall yield. Or say the optimum growing conditions shift northwards to an area that has a bad soil. Or say the methane gas production is increasing geometrically where not wanted. I think it is the combination of different climatic elements and length of cycle times that are important. Such as a crop requiring plenty of water in an area that has drought that time of year.

As Dr. Robson pointed out, we&#39;ve known that we affect the environment since the mid 1850s. The idea, as he said, is not controversial. Data about emissions caused by man is also not controversial, and began nearly as long ago. The data shows that we cause a large amount of greenhouse emissions, and that numbers have grown every year since recording began, and they are quite high. Are we the biggest factor? Why does that matter? The entire world became very aware of how rampant pollution had become in the first half of the 20th century, and by the late 60s saw major efforts to slow it as much as possible. There was a pretty unanimous consensus. That changed with the coining of the term &quot;Global Warming&quot;. Suddenly about half the population declared that it&#39;s a hoax and deny it. That&#39;s when protecting the earth became controversial, and now there are two sides. The US currently has a president actively rolling back standards that have been established, and not radical mandates, but pretty tame guidelines. Is protecting the environment only important if 97% of scientists agree? Does protecting drinking water only matter when the issue has become critical? Should we just all have bonfires because we may not be in imminent danger? Those making this argument are every bit as dishonest and disingenuous as those they accuse.

However, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and other trace gases are opaque to many wavelengths of thermal infrared energy.&quot; &quot;When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Like coals from a fire that are warm but not glowing, greenhouse gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in ALL DIRECTIONS&quot;. &quot;Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate heat in ALL DIRECTIONS, some of it spreads downward and ultimately comes back into contact with the Earth’s surface, where it is absorbed. The temperature of the surface becomes warmer than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating of the Earth’s surface by the atmosphere is the natural greenhouse effect.&quot; Up high or down low, I don&#39;t see any difference if NASA is correct. At the height of the Atmosphere, the Earth constitutes 1/3rd of the space. So the IR absorbed by the ghg, both for incoming sun heat and emitted Earth heat, will be absorbed then emitted in &quot;all directions&quot;. 1/3rd will hit the Earth below and the other 2/3rds will go into space. Of the Earth emitted heat, 1/3rd of that will be absorbed by the ghgs going out, and sent back to the earth adding additional warming to the earth, this warming is the greenhouse effect according to NASA. So, water vapor and the ghgs, cool the earth by blocking out 66.4% of Sun heat, while keeping in only 11% (1/3rd of 1/3rd). The atmosphere keeps out six times more heat than it keeps in. If we add more molecules of CO2 they will absorb more entering sun heat and cool the earth more than they do now. With the earth getting less heat, there will be less heat to keep in, so the GHE should fall.

Boils down to battery technology virtually being stagnant in recent years. Consider how much lithium batteries have (not) advanced in last decade or 2; what happens to these batteries at EOL (whether in 5-10 years, or simply when vehicle's time's up (sometimes sooner than later). To all: I think it is important to have an open mind on these sort of things. And allow scientists to express their views freely. Science is about curiosity and accuracy. A scientist would rather be 'proven' wrong than simply have a view accepted and not 'know' that they have errored. 2) Far as I can tell from the video (and seen this sort of info elsewhere not related to this channel): 3146 scientists responded out of 10-100s of 1000s the survey was sent to. The list of responses was trimmed down then carefully selected from the bunch. Cutting it short, the most disturbing detail (also heard elsewhere years back) is that the 97% crowd is made up of 75 out 77 humans. This makes the apparent ""global catastrophe"" claim look more like pulling the wool over everyone's eyes and punching them around in the head till they're dizzy enough to play along with whatever one would have thought unfathomable in this day and age.",UCHY1srOUdsBQ9TYrQgURXQA,1,UgxoXgnWCGWAQdr9rYV4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

That is a figure that has long been debunked. It has been based on a bad survey that used manipulated results to come to a pre-determined conclusion.

EVs are able to go 300+ miles now, and if you check out Aptera, that one can go 1,000+ miles. The speed of recharging is increasing, and Tesla for example has installed a nation-wide network of fast-chargers that can get you back on the road in only 30 minutes, and this will likely improve even more over time. Hybrid cars are also a decent middle ground for the time-being as technology advances. 2) There is 97% WORLDWIDE scientific consensus on projected climate change figures. The other 3% just disagree on how long it will take. 100% of them agree that climate change is real and that it's a threat. A brief google search and an afternoon and you will be all caught up.

There is time and then there is Geologic time, and if you don&#39;t have the competency to discern the difference you won&#39;t be able to understand what climate change is. Geologic time is the change in the climate over 1000&#39;s to 1,000,000&#39;s of years. At no point in the history of the earth have temperatures shifted so rapidly in such a short period of time, unless there has been a massive volcanic eruption, or an astroid hit the earth. Now don&#39;t think of CO2 as just a green house gas, think of it more as a measurement of energy(Heat) being released into the atmosphere relative to the natural cycle. The reason we measure CO2 is because it tells us how much energy is being released or captured by the environment which will naturally heat up the planet as the amount of energy being released is growing every year. We need to start capturing CO2 through reforestation, CO2 capture farming, and a shift to more efficient economic practices. We have time, but we need to act quickly and continue to develop new technologies and shift away from fossil fuels(Energy-Heat trapped under the earth over Millions of years). <br /><br />Climate change is obvious people if you can&#39;t comprehend it you are jeopardizing the lives of future generations.

If you do a historical review, you will find that CO2 levels have little to nothing to do with the climate. There are periods where CO2 was higher than now but the climate was colder. Likewise, there's periods where the CO2 levels were lower than now but the climate was warmer. CO2 is a non starter for climate change. As I mentioned earlier, CO2 was chosen because it is well known, not for its effect. In fact, nitrogen is far more reactive than CO2. Consider this, every volcanic eruption puts out more CO2 than mankind's recorded history. Don't forget the recent forest fires, the amount of CO2 released by the fires was incredibly huge. While not downplaying your concerns, the fact remains that your focus is on the wrong aspect. You should be more focused on the things that do affect climate.

You assume I can’t point to climate grants but if you go on the CPO NOAA website right now you’ll see lists of funding opportunities, the EPA doles out ungodly amounts of money for climate change research programs and none of them can come to ANY meaningful conclusion about how much man contributes to climate change. The truth is, you probably don’t want to believe that special interests have to lobby for funding so that programs like NASA and EPA can even continue to operate, but that’s ok. Keep your head in the sand and think we live in some perfect world where no one can be bought or sold, where science is done solely on the interest of science itself and money has nothing to do with it because scientists get paid no matter what their research findings are smh 🤦🏻‍♂️",UC7u-PqvlDWIgWxDojI2sdRQ,1,UgwEpVZWTUeQl-F9-2x4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

They are not sufficient in explaining the temperature change. Also according to most graphs we should experience a cooling when following the pattern of interglacial periods.

In a actual fact 97% of scientists believe the OVERWHELMING scientific evidence that human activity -- primarily from burning fossil fuel -- is warming the planet. The devastating wildfires in Australia last year, the mega-fires on the West Coast this year, and increasingly severe hurricanes in the Gulf are consequences of a warming planet. This point cannot be made strongly enough: Based 5 decades of CO2 data and hundreds of scientific papers, there is no questions that humans have a role in this warming. It is not being debated in the scientific community because the data are overwhelming. It may be politically satisfying to obfuscate and deny the evidence, but to what end? Ultimately, we&#39;re putting our children&#39;s future at risk. We&#39;re leaving them a degraded planet, and they will one ask why we did such stupid things to ruin God&#39;s gift to us. So the oil companies could make more money for their shareholders? But it not too late to do something. In 1988, George Bush Senior warned about the effects of global warming and said that the United States was a nation that had the power and the strength and the will to take on something as big as climate change. The United States is a great nation, so let&#39;s believe the science again and regain the lead -- now taken by the EU and China -- in developing renewables and creating jobs for the future instead of jobs for a dying fossil fuel industry.",UCy8aM1FbVjtWJ7wACLQzgsw,0,Ugz8EHvAtFsbgwhBvX14AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

He has specialised in gathering data on climate change as he describes in his online Biography. The Facts leading to Truth is extremely important in our world today, he is very good in his endeavors. <br />No one seems to object the facts that Al Gore, Elizabeth May, Barack Obama, Leonardo DiCaprio or Greta Thunberg are not climate scientists. Everyone is entitled to have their opinion heard at the table. What is important is what a person brings to a debate, the quality of evidence to the argument for that I hope we should have 100% agreement. <br />As a follow up to my post of the 29 August 2020 this video looks at a little history and the falsehood reporting on Climate Change which is propagating fraud/deception on mankind and continues to terrify our children.

Activists, politicians, populists (of either direction!) tend to oversimplify, and that doesn&#39;t work too well with profound science. Then there&#39;s the thing that as soon as you have numbers, you can juggle them around so that eventually, going with an appropriate wording, you can present whatever result you would like to show.<br />That being said, Dr. John Robson / CDN is doing exactly that, reinterpretating and taking the data that supports his view.<br /><br />Here a two examples:<br /><br />1. It&#39;s being critized that it is misleading to communicate the 97% consensus that only appears in a particular group of the respondents (77). And then this video continues with the much smaller consenus among meteorologists (64%), without stating that only 36 meteorologists responded. Very trustworthy indeed..<br /><br />2. The metioned 77 respondents were not categorized by the survey as &quot;describing themselves as experts&quot;. The 77 respondents were of the category &quot;climatologists actively publishing on climate change&quot;. All of the other groups, including the mentioned meteoroligst portion, are not actively involved in the scientific process or are not specialized on climate issues. Sounds different than &#39;small fraction that calls themselves experts&#39;, doesn&#39;t it? I do believe the response of the 77 should have a higher weighting than of the others.<br /><br /><br />Anyways, nothing of this proves or disproves that climate change is a hoax, not man-made, not dangerous, or whatever. It only shows you ought to be careful when the media, politics or your drinking buddy gives you some numbers you &#39;should definitely know&#39;.<br /><br /><br />As a member of the scientific community, I have the opinion that climate change is happening, and yes, also that it is mostly man-made.

A mathematician and Astrophysicist reviewed data and other existing studies on our sun. From this Valentina Zharkova developed a predictive algorithm on changes happening within our Sun. Zharkova found three distinct circulating fields of liquid plasta, always interacting, sometimes inhibiting and sometimes enhancing the dynamic field wave output, that being heat and light. Stable enough, the Sun is a dynamo that passes through cycles of cyclical change. Like a motor that ramps up or down, its output varies as does the corresponding electromagnetic field it generates. Everyone knows the sun has an 11 year cycle, consider now that larger cycles that return every 230-260 also exist. Such cycles are clearly seen repeating through our past. The dark ages, where cold and heightened volcanic and earthquake activity was indicative of what is and will be repeating itself today. The sun sets off a chain of events which affects our climate. 1. Lower dynamic generation within the sun. 2. Weakened electromagnetic field as a result of lowered dynamic generation. Sunlight passing through a weakened magnetic field, results in a weaker irradiance or intensity of light we receive. 3. Because the suns electromagnetic field creates and supports the magnetosphere that surrounds both the earth and the entire Solar System, it too weakens. The magnetosphere is an invisible shield that protects us from excessive Cosmic radiation 4. More Cosmic radiation is entering our Solar System and the earth's atmosphere, warming our air, land and water. 5. As oceans warm, CO2 and other gases are forced from dissolved suspension. Our oceans act as natural syncs for these gases. Research has shown temperatures have always increased prior to CO2 increase and vice versa. 6. Increasing radiation entering, is ionizing the atmosphere, with particles growing in size, attracting moisture, becoming dewdrops and then clouds. This cloud seeding is the reason for unpredictable rain and flooding. It has been estimated an additional 5% will be created blanketing the earth. At first insulting heat from leaving and then preventing the heat from warming its surface as much. 7. A team of Japanese researchers studied eruptions from four volcanoes over a 306 year period. With near certainty, they said 9 of the 11 happened when the sun was at a low point of electromagnetic field strength. Presently it is at its lowest in hundreds of years. The team went on to postulate that UV within the increasing radiation was heating and stimulating muons within the silica rich lava, enciting heightened volcanic and earthquake activity. NASA revealed several years ago that 10,000 underwater fissures existed not all active. Vulcanism is potentially warming our oceans from these fissures at the oceans floor. Sulfur being released is acidifying the oceans. 8. A combination of weakened irradiance and added cloud cover is nature's intricate dance to balance itself. Radiation has entered due to changes on our sun, it must now control and cool. In the following years we will see progressively cooler temps and longer winter seasons. This is not linear, high temps will still occur as climate transitions.",UCwuG-juyCuPFjHdmwjBkvGA,1,Ugw2BRvlDFOuVCBOjLV4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

The fact is that the earth has been hotter than today for most of the last 4 and a half billion years so if a scientist tells you that it&#39;s now the hottest it has ever been, he is lying through his teeth. Another fact is that CO2 consists of about .037% of our atmosphere in total. It is by definition a trace gas measured in parts per million. Let&#39;s use our brains people. To take a trace gas and blame it for the whole of global warming is ridiculous to say the least. The last fact; of that .037% of atmospheric CO2 only about .0016% is human caused. Which means most of the atmospheric CO2 is actually naturally occurring and NOT man made. Let&#39;s be clear, I have no problem with alternative energy, or cleaning up pollution.

But, I kept thinking, &quot;So, when is he going to detail and rebuke the the United Nations IPCC report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), published in 2018?&quot; I saw one very old picture of a few men in Stockholm representing the IPCC back who knows when. But the 2018 IPCC was absent. The IPCC was not even mentioned. The 2018 has both quality of testing (not surveys) and consensus detailed in the report from the gathering of many scientists from around the world. The surveys you site are interesting, but surveys can be used to manufacture results wanted; did someone choose specific scientists to survey? Even if the surveys were done correctly, surveys are usually just a first step, a spring board, into digging deeper into a subject. That is their value. Unfortunately, your information was a bit old; the subject matter around climate change varies as time goes on...and not to a positive outcome. Here is the part of the 2018 IPCC report that scares me; I will paraphrase: We have 12 years (it is down to 10 years now in 2020) to reduce carbon emissions by 50%. If we can do that, we have a 50% chance of survival in organized fashion for a few of us. OR there will be no more organized human communities, even if anyone survives. I listened to Noam Chomsky give a speech on climate change, and he agreed with the 2018 IPCC report. And if you know Noam Chomsky, the greatest intellectual of our time, you bet he tore that report apart and did his own literature search before coming to a conclusion. So, I look forward to you trying again. I would love to get this nervous lump out of my stomach.",UCxwabPXkA7QBkrdqfIa6f3Q,0,UgzbplexD0dSmtZmHpR4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

In fact, if it wasn't for humans, the earth would be cooling right now. The earths climate hasn't changed this fast since the last mass extinction. Its not the fact that the climate is changing, Its the rate at which it is. Also we know that historically C02 is a major contributor of climate change. And we are emitting Way more C02 than the earth naturally lets off. On top of this the amount of deforestation and overfishing and pollution from not only C02 but other chemicals and plastics is setting us on track for another Mass Extinction.

I'm not a scientist, but I do believe climate change has become more a political issue than science. I've often wondered how many grants have been given to researchers who want to investigate that fossil fuels have had minimal effect on climate.

Why then would anyone assume that climate change and the systematic destruction of our ecosystem including more than 20% of the rainforrest & 60% of Coral reefs either lost or shortly before being lost forever does not lead to effects in said ecosystem? To deny man-made climate change is to close one's eyes to reality.

The crisis is referred to ""climate change"" instead of ""global warming"" because destablising earth's climate system trough Carbon and other greenhouse gases and destruction of forest and other ecosystems will create more extreme weather events and natural disasters like storms, droughts etc. While it will also raise earths temperature in total it will feel different in different parts of the world. In order to prevent the impression that ""global Warming"" is false, simply because it turns out colder in an area that before, the term ""climate crisis"" is coined, to represent a broader viewpoint to it. Your assumption that the reason for climate change is unknown is also incorrect. It is widely known for decades which carbon ratios will lead to which effects on the ecosystem. In fact Exxon Mobile, an international Oil Fossil Fuel company, were among the first ones to proof the devastating effects that Carbon will have on our climate. Fossil Fuel lobbies these days are simply spreading diversion campaigns. They claim that their is no scientific consensus in order to simply delay policies that will hinder their profits. Nobody believes that Climate change is not real and man-made. They simply try to delay decisions. We don't have time to fall for their games. This is our life's and our world. Independent of political identity and desired tax policies we all have to acknowledged that we need this ecosystem to thrive and survive.

Well here's the deal you need to list out what natural features could cause the warming. Axis tilt? Volcanic reactions? Sun spots? Some plant that's emitting it? That's my question? And there has been NO potential natural occurring events to cause to the climate to raise to the Co2 ppm that is today. If there are please let me know. I think its idiotic to deny that climate change isn't caused by humans because there have no significant natural occurring events that have been recorded that have emitted such a great number of co2 particles. However humans on the other hand have emitted 36 billion tonnes of co2 every year, and it continues to increase. Yes the earth has had extinctions that were caused by climate change, and yes it has changed in the past, but not within 30 years, and what we don't understand is that every species living in our current climate isn't given enough time to change to new adapting climate, in fact this has occurred within a single generation of human beings.

Chameides had no training in either meteorology, atmospheric physics, solar physics, oceanography, paleogeology, earth science, ecology, or volcanology. He does have a PhD in atmospheric chemistry, but it was earned at Yale studying Ozone (another Gov’t scam, which cost us use of cheap, effective, non-polluting Freon, and other chlorofluorocarbons). He was politically active from the beginning of his career. His curriculum vitae is impressive, but his understanding of radiative physics and thermodynamics is sorely lacking. Perhaps if he’d studied with Richard Lindzen at MIT he wouldn’t have been derailed from science into politics? Or perhaps he went to Yale specifically because he wanted to be “relevant”?

Further, ""For a 2009 study, published in the journal Science, scientists analyzed shells in deep sea sediments to estimate past CO2 levels, and found that CO2 levels have not been as high as they are now for at least the past 10 to 15 million years, during the Miocene epoch. This was a time when global temperatures were substantially warmer than today, and there was very little ice around anywhere on the planet. And so sea level was considerably higher — around 100 feet higher — than it is today,” said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, in an email conversation. “It is for this reason that some climate scientists, like James Hansen, have argued that even current-day CO2 levels are too high.

The science message is &quot;there is man made global warming, but no clear agreement on how bad it is going to get&quot;, hence the 2C change limit, which was later revised to 1.5C, anything else is misquoting, not understanding the statement or taking parts of the conclusions. Accuracy and confidence improves gradually over time as more and more data from new satellites and affirmative studies. For me 80% confidence on something bad happening in the future and that there are measureable effects now is good enough for me to not put the gun to my head and pull the trigger, even at 50% I&#39;m not pulling the trigger.

Summary It has long been believed that the 20th warming was preceded by the ""Little Ice Age"" and the ""Medieval Warm Period"" as a result of the natural variability of climate. But as Bradley explains in this Perspective, recent research has shown that these climate patterns may not have been global, and are much more variable in time and space than previously assumed. However, one fact remains indisputable, namely that end-20th century temperatures were higher than at any time during the last millenium. View Full Text Again look at the above citation, from 2018 that states only in the previous 10 years (from 2008) has the pattern clearly emerged that the present is anthropogenic warming. Use rigorous sources and you will derive rigorous assumptions. Also note, Greenland to the contrary, the global pattern is that the present is unprecedented in terms of warming, and Greenland is catching up quickly, as the polar regions are warming significantly faster than lower latitudes.",UCM_Bp9M1OhY8ytzadOyAv0A,1,UgzvyjywfTzQYzXsAMt4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

2440,Ugw33tDlyRGzHh_pymd4AaABAg,1.0,3,2020-03-10 19:00:49,Ed Anderson,"SkepticalScience, a blog spearheaded by climate science “consensus” advocate John Cook, is widely considered the explanatory guidebook for the anthropogenic global warming movement. <br /> <br />The blog claims that CO2 molecules collectively function similar to that of a blanket, in reducing the rate at which the human body cools down. The rate or time-lapse involved in this “slowing” of heat loss, however, is problematic to the paradigm that says CO2 drives global warming. <br /> <br />Going technical for a minute, Professor Nasif Nahle has discovered that the “mean free path” for a quantum wave to pass through the atmosphere before colliding with a CO2 molecule is about 33 meters (Nahle, 2011a), and such a wide gap between molecular collisions hardly conjures-up the image of CO2 functioning like a blanket. <br /> <br />And even more saliently, Nahle has mathematically assessed that the rate at which CO2 molecules can retain heat at the surface may only last about 0.0001 of a second (Nahle, 2011b) — meaning that the atmospheric CO2 concentration, whether it be 300 PPM or 400 PPM, effectively doesn’t matter — the time-lapse differential would be immaterial for either concentration. <br /> <br />Consequently, Nahle has concluded that “carbon dioxide has not an effect on climate changes or warming periods on the Earth” and his work has been endorsed by the Faculty of Physics of the University of Nuevo Leon (Mexico).",UCjqr1GsZ0lkj8v6ocQezq0w,0,Ugw33tDlyRGzHh_pymd4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

We could spend trillions of dollars combating CO2 but will likely do nothing to stop it because those do nothing to overcome the main contributor to global warming which is the sun activity itself. It&#39;s like trying to drain a pool with a straw in the middle of a storm. If the earth is going to go through a temperature cycle then that&#39;s what is going to happen and we are fools to think we can stop that cycle. It&#39;s why there have been 5 major climate shifts in the earth&#39;s history before man was ever in the picture.

Do you know what the genetic fallacy is? 2. It's literally not. Which data? 3.

If you can't cite it, then it is merely a conspiracy theory. 'But look at the pattern. Not a single study has ever been funded by NASA to look at alternative causes.' Which 'alternative causes'? Those have been debunked: Every time they fund a study, its to prove that man is responsible or to look at the result of man made climate change. WHEN people find that their studies do not support their original supposition that man is responsible, they refuse to pay the last payments and shut it down, then black list the researcher.' https://skepticalscience.com/climate-scientists-in-it-for-the-money.htm They can get paid way more by the oil companies. Again, the genetic fallacy. Please stop attacking NASA but instead question the science. The studies are still accurate, no matter the motive. And where is the proof that 'they refuse to pay the last payments and shut it down, then black list the researcher.'? '""This is a basic rule that applies to all statements which are contested."" Yea, I understand it is not fair to expect you to actually think. In your religion that is forbidden.' What religion? Okay, I get your referring to the 'climate cultists'.

Which is to say scientists, of varied backgrounds, who have devoted a substantial portion of their careers to observing, analyzing, and/or predicting climate patterns. On the other hand, most so called climate scientists aren't. Like the guys or gals who write the code for the usually poorly performing climate models. To call them a climate scientist, as opposed to a software engineer is, if you ask me, a misnomer. But that's what they do, in order to trump up the number of ""climate scientists"" who are part of this so called consensus. It's an appeal to authority logical fallacy. Random statistician gets called in to analyze a climate related data set, suddenly he becomes a climatologist. Regardless of weather or not he agrees with the IPCCs policy recommendations, he's included as an assenting voice. I actually don't agree with you about meteorology being a prerequisite to competently study climate. Oddly, as I'm usually on the other side of that debate. But I mean, you could have a geologist, who simply excavates ice cores, and catalogs data from those samples, who is effectively studying the ancient climate.

Supposing the worst case scenario is the eventual outcome, what does that look like? Unfortunately to climate alarmists, it does not mean the end of human life. <br />However, realistically, we CAN expect a rise in sea levels such that most of the worlds shipping ports are unusable, and massive sustained flooding in lower lying areas. The issue is nobody seems to know what the time scale could be. 10 years? 50 years? 100 years? <br /><br />If you pour into the results, the actual data, not just the summaries or catchy headlines, this is essentially what you find. These are the facts as we understand them - sea levels are rising and will very likely continue to rise between 3 and 15 meters, going by historical data. <br />There is likely little we can do to prevent this - its going to happen regardless of human interaction, but there are indications humans are increasing the speed at which it will happen. <br />The impact of human interaction is still debated, we just don&#39;t have enough data to make a concrete conclusion and thus the time frame is speculation. <br /><br />There is no right answer to how much should we spend, or how should we spend this money, to mitigate, prevent, or prepare for climate change. I dont have an answer to fiscal policy and, in all honesty, most of the &quot;spend money to solve climate change&quot; plans I see governments doing seem misguided.<br /><br />Question the conclusions being reported. Double check the data. Read the scientific papers that get published. There is a reason the information is made public for peer review. You don&#39;t have to believe scientists - take the time to read and understand the data collected, how it was collected, and how it was assessed, and determine for yourself if the conclusions make sense.

This channel does not allow links to be posted, so I am going to copy-paste here one of the articles on this quote, this one is from Snopes dot com: ______________________________________________________ Did Mark Twain Say ‘It’s Easier to Fool People Than to Convince Them That They Have Been Fooled’? While the quote ""it's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled"" is often attributed to Mark Twain, there's no evidence that the author actually wrote this phrase. Dan Evon Published 29 December 2016 Claim Mark Twain said that it's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. Rating Unproven Origin A quote frequently attributed to Mark Twain gained greater prominence in 2016 as media publications debated the effect of “fake news” on the internet: It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. The quote shown here has been attributed to Mark Twain (or Samuel Clemens, if you prefer) by dozens of web sites, books, and memes, and was even available on a T-shirt sold by Amazon. However, none of these sources provided any information about where or when Twain allegedly said this. Was it written or spoken? Did it appear in a book or a newspaper article? A lack of source information for this particular quote is especially noteworthy, because Mark Twain’s writing was very well-documented. Several volumes of quotes from the author of _Huckleberry Finn_ have been compiled, yet we were unable to find this quote in any of them. Barbara Schmidt, who operates TwainQuotes . com, told us that she also had no evidence that Twain wrote or uttered this phrase. However, Schmidt directed us to a passage from the _Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 2,_ in which he expressed a similar opinion about the power of a lie:: The general idea of that quote (although not that wording) is one Mark Twain expressed in regard to lying — in that is it hard to convince people they have been a victim of a lie. He did state: “The glory which is built upon a lie soon becomes a most unpleasant incumbrance. … How easy it is to make people believe a lie, and how hard it is to undo that work again!” – Autobiographical dictation, 2 December 1906. Published in _Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 2_ (University of California Press, 2013) The full quote, which can be viewed via The Mark Twain Project, reads as follows (emphasis ours): _The truth is, I did not have to wait long to get tired of my triumphs. Not thirty days, I think. _*_The glory which is built upon [a] lie soon becomes a most unpleasant incumbrance._*_ No doubt for a while I enjoyed having my exploits told and retold and told again [in my presence] and wondered over and exclaimed about, but I quite distinctly remember that there presently came a time [when] the subject was wearisome [and odious] to me and I could not endure the disgusting discomfort of [it.] I am well aware that the world-glorified doer of a deed of great and real splendor has just my experience; I know that he deliciously enjoys hearing about it for three or four weeks, and that pretty soon after that he begins to dread the mention of it, and by and by wishes he had been with the damned before he ever thought of doing that deed; I remember how [General Sherman used to rage and swear [over] “When we were marching through Georgia,”] which was played at him and sung at him everywhere he went; still, I think I suffered a shade more than the legitimate hero does, he being privileged to soften his misery with the reflection that his glory was at any rate golden and reproachless in its origin, whereas I had no such privilege, there being no possible way to make mine respectable._ *_How easy it is to make people believe a lie, and [how] hard it is to undo that work again!_*_ [Thirty-five years after those evil exploits of mine I visited my old mother, whom I had not seen for ten years]; and being moved by what seemed to me a rather noble and perhaps [page 303] heroic impulse, I thought I would humble myself and confess my ancient fault. It cost me a great effort to make up my mind; I dreaded the sorrow that would rise in her face, and the shame that would look out of her eyes; but after long and troubled reflection, the sacrifice seemed due and right, and I gathered my resolution together and made the confession._ It is possible that someone else paraphrased Twain’s words, and others conflated both the actual phrase and the paraphrase over time. However, we have been unable to find evidence that Twain spoke or wrote this exact phrase.",UCTkuI6q86tW8njedL_OXv2w,1,UgxbI2zU-9jNIza2qEh4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I am always interested in debate and cooperative truth-seeking for the betterment of ourselves and society. And I believe the overwhelming evidence pointing towards man-made climate change. 1) The Earth is getting warmer: The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century. 2) The analysis of the data of our carbon emission, our understanding of how carbon affects the atmosphere and or measuring of the activities of the sun show that this change in global temperature is driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. 3) Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and is accelerating slightly every year. 4) Our current trajectory would lead to an apocalyptic rise of approximately 5° which would leave whole countries uninhabitable, create mass migration within every country and between countries, cause mass starvation, mass extinction incomparable to anything we have seen, yet. 5) The activities of the sun do not cause the climate changes we witness. We are currently approaching the grand solar minimum, which has a cooling effect not a warming one, and it effect is shown to be minimal at 0,2% of the total influences altering the climate. Also the inner layers of our atmosphere are warming, only. Stronger solar activities would heat up all layers of the atmosphere in equal correlation. 6) Some of the first scientists that have realized the danger of climate change were of EXXON, in 1977 more than 10 years before it become a public topic for the first time. They made two independent studies and their conclusions were so real, that they simply shifted their gears and became the forefront of climate deniers, hiding their findings and masking their knowledge. Their strategy is simply to delay the consensus that climate change is real, so that until then their business can run unimpeded. - and there is more evidence but it would be too long and you would not read it anymore. It is hard for me to understand why people try to avoid these facts. I talked to many people that brought up the Ozone layer as a counter argument, because it regenerated to some degree, exactly because the changed laws and education of the public that were implemented after the scientific warnings. It regenerated since thanks to science's intervention we stopped using so many Ozone Gases. It is no different for climate change, why do people want it to be?

Of course you only resort to the papers that do take a stance. For many of the 12.000 papers, it was simply irrelevant. For example, when studying the result of different levels of co2 on plants, you do not have to take a stance on where this co2 comes from. Anyone who disagrees with the existence of this consensus is absolutely free to do their own study. It's been 7 years and none have been released. Also, on a less scientific approach as to the consensus: have you heard of the movement ""scientists for future""? It's basically the academic arm of Fridays for future. Last year, a petition was launched, which only verified scientists from the broader fields of climate-related sciences were allowed to sign. You had to deliver proof that you work in this field.

Since its release, the standpoints of the creators of those studies have been taken into account after a rather laughable ""follow up study"" by David Legates et al. and some scrutiny by Richard Tol (some of which was justified, some wasn't). Cook's team released a bunch of updates and, after some re- and re-re- evaluation ended up at 97% again. The abstracts of all studies used are freely available on their website and have been for 7 years now. I've spent more time than I'm willing to admit looking into this whole affair after I was given Legates's paper as reference against Cook's study. And that, in my opinion is a pretty good thing and that's where some of my confidence is derived from. Somebody made a study, it was challenged by different people, it was re-evaluated and withstood the scrutiny. Neither Tol nor Legates had to face a great deal of adversity because of their criticism. (Although Legates was kind of fired because of dodgy payments from ExxonMobil, but I've been told off before for suggesting a link there, so I won't, because it's irrelevant for this topic) At this point I'm procrastinating.

Zealots and alarmists always have more energy and enthusiasm than the dispassionate, objective engineer or scientist and flooded with funds from leftist donors, always manage to have an outsized impact than what their numbers would suggest. Their agitation has been detrimental to the very energy source that would actually make a difference to their stated goals if lowering GHGs was really what they wanted (Nuclear Power). Per MWHr of electricity produced, NP has the least impact on the environment yet these same folks who demand an end to the fossil fuel industry, also demand an end to NP.

I am also aware that none of the data is absolutely accurate. On cases like these you tend to use the findings most commonly found independently, or rather the tendency thereof. These details and the consensus on them do, in fact, change all the time. I will also give you that the IPCC may have to exaggerate sometimes. One of the reasons being that we have known how serious the issue is since the early 1960s and the last 60 years have made abundantly clear that pretty please and polite asking just don't cut it. We know for a fact, and the data is more than abundant, that the way we are treating the planet is unsustainable by any stretch of the imagination. ""Things might be significantly be worse in the future"" historically has made next to nobody change anything about this behaviour. Also, have you read the IPCC reports? The language style they are written in, unfortunately make it pretty much a necessity to exaggerate because most politicians won't understand a single thing. That's why there's a TL;DR for policy makers in there. There exist entire companies with the sole purpose of debunking climate change and pretending all is shiny.

I think you are overstating the position of the skeptics.  I don't think they feel the ""consensus"" is a hoax, I've not heard one of them say that (that I can recall).  What they do say is that there are many methodological flaws with the consensus position (I listed some of the problems in earlier posts to you) but that their views are often drowned out by the angry and often vicious responses.   Much of what you state above is simply your belief that all is hunky dory with the consensus position and that there haven't been serious challenges to it.  McIntyre & Mckitrick took apart the hockey stick and there have been members of the ""consensus"" group who have acknowledged this pair had some very valid points.  For the laymen, it often comes down to who you trust so that when papers are published or critiques written that challenge the consensus, the climate faithful often discount them.  The hockey team doesn't remain silent when they're criticized, in addition to Mann suing those who disparage his claims, the team writes responses that again, the faithful uncritically accept as valid refutations of the critics. ""You get Our funding for researching a specific field, no matter the outcome of said funding."" I don't mean any offense when I say this but I find such statements naive.  ""Yet, nobody has been able to reliably show exactly what's wrong with it ..."" In the video I posted, they show you one clear example of the manipulation of data where they truncate Briffa's data cutting it off at the 1960s? because to include his entire data set would be to change the graph to one not so alarming. They did so clearly to present a more alarming picture which is the whole purpose of the IPCC. If there is NO alarming future due to climate change, there is no reason for the IPCC to exist.  ""If they had, that would be the version currently endorsed."" You demonstrate more faith in the process than I think is warranted.

Think of all the resistance from the billion dollar companies that have invested in these ""clean"" energy schemes and the millions donated to organizations whose sole purpose is to promote climate catastrophe. It would never be one man whose paper did this. Consider the 100s and 1000s of papers already written that confirm a global MWP and LIA all apparently discarded when the need to get rid of these periods became necessary to the maintenance of the hockey stick.

On the Medieval warming period (MWP) AND the Little ice age (LIA): @t From the above: ""The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) is the most contentious of the late Holocene climatic oscillations because of claims by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and CO2alarmists that it didn't really happen, ie, the basis for the infamous “hockey stick” assertion of no climate changes until CO2 increase after 1950."" ""Historical accounts confirm the worldwide occurrence of the MWP. It was a time of warm climate from about 900 AD to 1300 AD."" ""Elsewhere in the world, prolonged droughts affected the southwestern United States and Alaska warmed. Sediments in central Japan record warmer temperatures. Sea surface temperatures in the Sargasso Sea were approximately 1°C warmer than today (Keigwin, 1996), and the climate in equatorial east Africa was drier from 1000 AD to 1270 AD. An ice core from the eastern Antarctic Peninsula shows warmer temperatures during this period."" And on and on with evidence for a world wide MWP. In Brian Fagan's book, ""The Long Summer"" he documents the fact that during this period (MWP), snows melted in the Andes and Lake Titicaca water level dropped as much as 17 meters. Brian Fagan also wrote about the Little Ice Age in a book with that title. There are literally hundreds of studies/papers documenting the MWP and LIA and not as a local phenomenon. Dr. Sebastian Luning, PhD, said the notion that they were local phenomenons , ""A nutty claim."" When you consider that the proponents of a ""local phenomenon"" had stated that they needed to get rid of the MWP & LIA (because it conflicted with Mann's hockey stick) and subsequent to this came papers claiming this was so, I am quite skeptical.

We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors’ self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.""* Nowhere does this state that they were trying to find what percent of science believe 50% or more of recent global warming is man-made. All it is trying to find, according to the abstract, is what percent of scientist believe humans are causing warming (which again, warming could be 0-100% of all warming seen thus far). Also, as stated, studies that follow similar methods will find similar numbers, and tell us roughly the same exact thing. Now as for Legates, I found his study ( https://sci-hub.tw/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-013-9647-9 ) criticizing the consensus, and I could find nothing indicating that he was criticizing how random the data set was, you can look through it though and correct me if I'm wrong., it might have gone over my head.

After the aforementioned Criticism, John Cook & Daniel Bedford released a detailed clarification (Cook & Bedford 2013. Agnotology, Scientific consensus and the Teaching and Learning of Climate Change: A Response to Legates, Soon and Briggs) In this paper, they went so far as to say, and I quote: ""Of the 4,014 abstracts that expressed a position on the issue of human-induced climate change, Cook et al. (2013) found that over 97 % endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause. Less than 2 % of the abstracts rejected this view."" So it isn´t about us ""causing more than 0%"" at all. As for the criticim and the question whether they might have criticised that it may have been ""too"" random. No. They literally citicised the mere fact that it was random. They then went on to cound the papers that don´t take a stance (in most cases because it isn´t required for most research) as refuting the claim. The 3% are quite easily explained, I think. If you think of the Cook study of using a scale from 0 causation to 100% Causation, everything under 50% was counted as ""not supporting the claim"". Please note that this is a gross oversimplification as i can´t find the actual paper right now and it might have been taken from Cook´s own website on which he explained the methodology in much greater detail than in the original release. And also, there are the studies evidently founded by companies like ExxonMobile who also funded Legates et al. (Legates, by the way lost his position due to the extremely dubious paiments) and other ""Merchants of Doubt"" if that expression rings a bell. I am aware that this reches conspiracy theory levels, but as to the Legates study, I´ve done my fair share of digging and can 100% confirm that they were paid by Big Oil to ""debunk"" Cook´s study and that they are not the only ones trying to seed doubt about the connection of humans and climate change.",UCb7dL70UxK2RpJLkWP1FvgA,1,UgxpjMNJlu5ZfY6wbwN4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Of course there's consensus among them, because the study that found the 97% figure was perfect in every form, it wasn't flawed whatsoever, and was thus infallible. However, like I said, It's a broad consensus, okay, so 97% of scientist believe we have at least some impact on climate change, even if that is 0.001%... and? Now, if those organizations agreed on a study showing that climate change is mostly man-made or that it's man-made, then yes, that would be significant.

Now certainly we do play a very notable role in the climate, one very critical in understanding why our climate is why it is the way it is now; however, just because 97% of scientist believe humans are responsible for more than 0% of climate change, does NOT mean the majority agree we play a significant role. Now, I'm not trying to falsify the study, as it was correct in everything it claimed. I am trying to falsify the idea that it contributes anything meaningful to the debate, and should NOT be cited as a support that most of climate change is man-made, it's dangerous, etc. etc., because it addresses none of that, yet so many people act as if it does. Now, every study that I have seen that has found a similar figure to Cooks study has thus far used almost the same exact methods and asked the same exact question has his study, only questioning different subjects, so of course the results would be consistent. As for the Legates study, I have never heard of ir nor read it. Now i will be the devils advocate and go out on a limb here. Have you ever considered that when Legate was criticizing the random sample, they were criticizing it for being TOO random. The more random a survey is the less bias the answers will be, but the less relevant those being surveyed will be as well. In the Cook Study they did survey quit a few studies that only mentioned climate change, not even covered it. For example, one study was in there that was examining the effects of climate change on a specific insect species. Yes that does surround climate change, but those being surveyed are unqualified in climate science and their paper was for the most part irrelevant. Now, one thing that I will say I'm surprised about is the 3%; rather than the 97%. I actually find it shocking that 3% of all of the scientist and abstracts surveyed showed the stance that humans have no impact on climate change. That number is just shockingly high in my opinion.",UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA,1,UgxpjMNJlu5ZfY6wbwN4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Of course the Cook study gives no useful information about climate change. Nor does it claim it does. It shows that 97% of papers that take a stance take a stance in favour of the human element in climate change. It validates the claim that an overwhelming consensus exists on the fact that humans play a major role in climate change. it also does not ask a yes or no question as you claim. There is a scale of, if i remember correctly, five steps between ""humans have absolutely no influence"" to ""Humans have extreme influence"". The Study came out in 2013 and nobody has found significant flaws in it. Richard Tol came to a 91% consensus, but Cook has since clarified, and Tol has not refuted, that Tol´s methodology was flawed.

Of those ~65%, ~97% agree that humans do in-fact have some impact on the climate. Okay, but ""do humans have an impact on the climate(?)"" is a very broad question.

As the primary speaker with the plaid shirt says, the people reporting that are overwhelmingly not going to be trained scientists of statisticians because the survey didn&#39;t find all those sentiments from the same 97% and to present otherwise is innacurate and deceptive. <br /><br />However, for the narrator lady to then sum up that <br />1)&quot; &#39;most&#39; experts agree that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas &quot; <br />2) &quot;and probably causes SOME warming&quot; <br />3) &quot;human activity has SOME impact on climate, probably including SOME warning&quot; <br /><br />- all seem like very incautious or deliberately misleading language, not least because it&#39;s unclear how she chooses the &#39;experts&#39; she includes:<br /><br />1): Given the soft, squishy sound of &#39;most&#39;, this is a worrying word to use to describe how many agree on the elementary idea that CO2 is a greenhouse gas - it&#39;s exact, precise level of impact (including by comparison to others like water or methane) may be debated, but the idea that it&#39;s not a GH gas at all is very hard to find represented credibly.<br /><br />Futher to the language aspect I just came from a video called &#39;cimate scientist takes on room full of sceptics&#39; where the scientist talks <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewJ6TI8ccAw&amp;t=29m30s"">29:30</a>mins about the vital importance of strictly defining terms like &quot;Likely&quot; given that different people have WILDLY different interpretations of the meaning:<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hCRafyV0zI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hCRafyV0zI</a> <br />(see @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewJ6TI8ccAw&amp;t=29m30s"">29:30</a>mins, for his work researching and defining stats-language, but I also recommend the video for explaining the scientific response to many common concerns held by sceptics)<br /><br />2) again, &quot;SOME&quot; is dangerous language here, the numerical meaining of which will be influenced by linguistics and existing beliefs. The dictionary def of some is &#39;an unspecified amount or number of.&#39; - which means the narrator takes no specific view, when actually this is another field where the substantial majority agree it&#39;s a major contributor, certainly not minor, even if exact numbers are debated.<br /><br />3) &quot;Some&quot; (once again) is now used to describe the impact of ALL human activity, which includes effects like CO2, methane from global farming, manmade aerosols (which have a cooling effect) as well as mass deforestation and land clearance. To imply that all these massive scale actions merely have &#39;some&#39; impact is, again, alarmingly far from reality. Perhaps the authors didn&#39;t consider some of these less hot-topic factors, and maybe they factored in their vaguely-stated (again, the language used isn&#39;t helpful) conclusions/doubts about CO2&#39;s role as it barely had any...<br /> <br />Furthermore, when the host talks about the smearing of dissenting voices amongst the scientific community, there are problems with this claim too - Skeptics across the board may well be unfairly vilified - anyone can see that these are uncivil times for politicised discourse, and in the video I linked, both the sceptical audience and the climate scientist describe experiences of death-threats and abuse they have received - so this nastiness does fly both ways - but the scientific community themselves will only truly discredit those who&#39;s science, and advocacy of that science, does not hold up to scrutiny or who&#39;s impact is greatly misnterpretted or overstated in significance to the other factors and research. <br /><br />Bear in mind that climate scientists THEMSELVES are constantly &#39;dissenting&#39; by re-checking their and their peers assumptions, critically reviewing the conclusions of their peers (often, tearing them to shreds) and doing their best to include all factors that could effect existing figures and consensus undesrstanding. This is the scientific process! If you cant criticise your peers, or you cant accept valid scientifically sound criticisms yourself, you are not only a bad scientist but your career will actually be stilted by it because of the way that surviving criticism / peer-rewiew is actually CRUCIAL to earning respect in the science community.<br /><br />-The difference here (and the reason that critical analysis of existing research and assumptions is usually NOT shunned) is when sceptical scientists claim that their findings counter completely the established scientific consensus. Again, no scientist&#39;s career can survive ignoring soundly-made (and peer-critiqued without major flaws being exposed) research that disproves or casts into doubt his own conclusions, without taking these on board.<br /><br />Part of the trouble is that 100% perfect methodically-impeccable research is as rare as unicorns, and the authors of flawed data are often reluctant to own the fact wholly; but this is why the whole world of science is founded upon consensus that is formed by debate and critical peer review, so that bias is countered by the aggregate (and meta-analysis) of all the good and best-quality research out there.<br /><br />Less commonly, people are also shunned when the science is actually undertaken dishonestly and in bad faith, much like the &#39;experts&#39; who were paid to deny the impacts of petrolleum lead-pollution in the air for years, or that a cigerette a day was good for you!",UCtWSeyisiNnpO4tGbqysH3A,0,UgygUkMy4woupF5Pxzp4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Robinson observed that, among the pollutants reviewed, carbon dioxide &quot;is the only air pollutant which has been proven to be global importance to man&#39;s environment on the basis of a long period of scientific investigation.&quot; Summarizing the findings of the President’s Science Advisory Council, Robinson noted that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels were outstripping the natural CO2 removal processes that keep the atmosphere in equilibrium. He noted that the speed of CO2 accumulation would depend on fossil fuel consumption and projected that, on then-present trends, atmospheric CO2 could reach 400ppm by 2000, and that exploiting all then-recoverable fossil fuel would lead to concentrations of 830ppm. The report warned that rising CO2 would result in increases in temperature at the earth&#39;s surface, and that significant temperature increase could lead to melting ice caps, rising seas, and potentially serious environmental damage worldwide. It noted that, even if Antarctic ice caps took 1000 years to melt, this would mean sea level rises of four feet per ten years—&quot;100 times greater than observed changes.&quot; Importantly, SRI acknowledged that of the various sources proposed for rising atmospheric CO2, &quot;none seems to fit the presently observed situation as well as the fossil fuel emanation theory.&quot; Noting uncertainties about whether particulate pollution would offset some of this warming, SRI warned &quot;…there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe…&quot; The industry&#39;s own consulting scientists then confirmed that the most urgent research need was into technologies that could bring CO2 emissions under control.",UCpLR-08FueGhec7YZNr6IEQ,0,UgzMF1xQCW_Og2Xbi8B4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

A German professor has confirmed what skeptics from Britain to the US have long suspected: that NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies has largely invented “global warming” by tampering with the raw temperature data records. <br /> <br />Professor Dr. Friedrich Karl Ewert is a retired geologist and data computation expert. He has painstakingly examined and tabulated all NASA GISS’s temperature data series, taken from 1153 stations and going back to 1881.

Fred Singer an Atmospheric Physicist. He is Professor of Emeritus of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia and has served as the founding director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service. This was in a New York City news paper in 2009. Dr. S. Fred Singer, is one of the world&#39;s most respected and widely published experts on climate. He knows far more about climate change than Obama, Gore and for sure Bernie Sanders and Hillary. And Leonardo DeCRAPO or Neil deGrasse Tyson <br /> <br /> <br />S. FRED SINGER <br /> <br />The single most important issue is whether climate change is natural or human-caused. In principle, both options are plausible. But we know climate changes naturally, on times scales of decades and centuries. <br /> <br />So which is more important: the human release of gases or natural cycles? One cannot go by the majority view--science does not work like politics. <br /> <br />We cannot use the fact that there is a rough correlation between temperature increase and increase in CO2. During much of the 20th century, from 1940 to 1975, the climate cooled while CO2 levels rose. And during the past decade climate has again been cooling in spite of the rise in CO2. <br /> <br />The answer is to look at the pattern of warming trends and see if it agrees with what models predict. The models all predict the existence of a &quot;hot spot&quot; -- a maximum warming trend in the tropical region. The observations from weather balloons show the opposite result, a slight cooling trend. This disagreement between calculated and observed fingerprints of temperature trends is the strongest argument against any appreciable human contribution to climate. <br /> <br />THE FOLLOWING IS PART OF THE SAME ARTICLE: <br /> <br />It might make a lot more sense to draw a correlation between man-made carbon dioxide levels and the rising temperatures if the temperatures hadn&#39;t decreased in the last decade. <br /> <br />&quot;The Earth&#39;s climate has always alternated between warming and cooling phases,&quot; said William Happer, who served the Department of Energy under former President George H. W. Bush. &quot;In the medieval warming period, when the Norse settled Greenland, the Earth warmed as fast or faster that it has since the 1800&#39;s. What should world governments have done in the year 900 A.D., when people noticed that the climate was warming and the ice was melting in southern Greenland?&quot; <br /> <br />Studies show that average global temperatures have decreased as much as 0.2 degrees Celsius over the last ten years----just as human activity is thought to be taking its biggest toll on the planet&#39;s climate. <br /> <br />The decrease is small, to be sure, but, say skeptics, it disproves the argument that rising man-made CO2 levels are the driving force behind global warming.",UCBGSh3kifneGqsNbix6qptg,0,UgzTjUNbifbgkZiN5ex4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

The bad science came first from the GISS, which was a handful of computer jockeys led by James Hansen, the father of modern CO2 warming theory. It really is sad. Real scientists have had to refute dopey ideas like warming due to CO2 for over 200 years now: Tyndall first published it, and was easily disproved by his peers. Arrhenius conjectured about it 100 years ago, and he was soundly refuted by his peers. Revelle started tracking the Keeling curve, but came to his senses 50 years ago, after lengthy discussions with Fred Seitz, who had been studying the matter as a solid state physicist. Point is, this malarkey has been refuted FOUR TIMES! Compare the real NASA and the fake NASA: Real: Multiple campuses of more then 25 Buildings (each), and 10,000 scientists, engineers, and administrators spread out across the country, from LA to Kennedy Space Center. Fake: One corner of one floor in one building on a single campus (Columbia University in NYC) and six computer programmers (no science training), except for Hansen. Real NASA: Represented by Dr. Roy Spencer, who created the most scientific measurements of global mean temperatures using satellite data, collected by Microwave Sounding Units. Awarded NASA’s highest medal for achievement, retired and continues to publish monthly atmospheric temperature data. Office was shot at by Climate Activist lunatics. Fake NASA: Represented by Dr. James Hansen. Arrested 3 times for political protests while on salary at NASA. Reprimanded by his boss at NASA (Dr. John Theon) for refusing to remain neutral about global warming, in accordance with NASA policy regarding all political matters.

You must also consider that many many well respected scientists that have spoken out against climate change have subsequently had their grants terminated, their research terminated, their employment terminated and their reputations as scientists smeared with ludicrous rumours. There is no better way to kill your career as a scientist than to openly admit that you are not in the alledged ""consensus"".

Thank you for providing compelling evidence for what so many of us already knew to be the case, but have not been able to evidence with such authoritative clarity.<br /><br />Incidentally, the public also needs to be aware that the same false claims about there being “an almost universal scientific consensus on the Theory of Evolution” are made repeatedly, when that is not the case. The same vague terminology as in the Climate debate is used in questions about what we mean by “Evolution” - and, just as Scientists are now put under huge pressure to conform to the false, pervading view that Climate change is Man made and a Global Emergency, and are vilified and ostracised if they dare to disagree... any scientist who dares to contradict the ostensibly accepted view that the universe began with the Big Bang explosion (of something that came into existence without explanation)... and life subsequently began (all by itself without explanation)... is similarly ridiculed and faces the very likely risk of losing any research funding along with their job or career... <br /><br />Thus, in both the Climate debate and the Cosmology and Evolution debate, we have many scientists who have to keep their findings and true opinions to themselves, for fear of losing their livelihood and their reputation. Sadly, many branches of science are NO LONGER the unbiased and independent fields of honest research that they once were, because corrupt profit motives, vested political interests, globalist power politics, ideological indoctrination, and fanatical environmental activism... to say nothing of the rise of humanist secularism versus established Christian beliefs and values... have all served to turn the domain of scientific enquiry into an opinionated battleground where many of these struggles are fought... all of which compromises the naively outdated claim that science and the scientists who pursue it, are both unbiased and dependable with regard to the accuracy and authenticity of their claims, and the “proven facts” that their research supposedly unearths. 🤷🏻‍♂️",UCvLVOzL7zuoKGPydceIhmTw,0,UgzmuwkkHwgUDZij5jB4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Democratic Socialism is destroying our society and the socialists call it capitalism. When I point out that a central bank was Karl Marx&#39;s 5 plank of 10 in his book The Communist Manifesto, they simply ignore this communist social policy. In 1911, government officials and banking interests tried to meet secretly and met at the hunting lodge of J.P. Morgan on Jeyckl Island, GA to plan how they were going to get the Citizens and politicians to go along with the enactment of a central bank. When you give such monopoly powers to a relatively small group of extremely wealthy families, what do you think is going to happen? Within just 16 years, our nation and world were in perhaps the Greatest Depression the world may have ever experienced. That&#39;s when folks like Eugene Meyer and his cronies started buying up assets at pennies on the dollar like he did by buying the Washington Post out of bankruptcy in 1933. He was N.Y. Federal Reserve President and former World Bank President. His son-in-law was Philip L. Graham owner of both network radio and TV stations, was married to his daughter Katherine and his nephew Bob Graham went on to become the Florida Governor and U.S. Senator. The Zionist movement really got organized in the late 1800s and by 1913 had central banks operating in every major industrialized nation. They still meet at the Bank of International Settlement (BIS) every two months privately, in addition to their public meetings. They don&#39;t invite me so I have no idea what they are discussing. Is it just me, or does it sound a bit conspiratorial, using taxpayers money to build highly centralized governments and a banking system in which to gain greater and greater power. When you can tax the majority and redistribute their wealth through foreign and military aid to close to 200 nations annually, giving Isreal alone $3.1 billion annually while tent cities grow larger here in the U.S., it makes you wonder, doesn&#39;t it? We need to replace our tin hats with silver ones. If everyone would start buying one ounce of silver and/or gold as often as possible it would soon upset their banking controls and use of printed credit-based fiat currencies. They would be forced to go back to the bimetallic system which makes it much harder to run deficits and print money. The fiat system is going to crash anyway, just a matter of time. The more real money people have in their pockets the better.",UCvvYqTrMO-rPjTUgg05JxeA,0,UgxUi7GXmH4E6NbS2A54AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

The red planet, which moved closer to the Earth on Monday than at any other time since 2005, has retreated from a glacial period that would have covered large areas in white before the thaw about 370,000 years ago, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science. The research was conducted using an instrument on board the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that allowed an unprecedented examination of “the most recent Martian ice age recorded in the planet’s north polar ice cap,” according to a NASA press release. https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/31/mars-also-undergoing-climate-change-ice-age-retrea/",UCBGSh3kifneGqsNbix6qptg,1,UgzIailTMZnP2M3ie014AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

If you take the models they have presented and run them backwards, the ice age would be in the 1800s. The cherry picking on both sides of this argument is ridiculous. If they really want to create a better model they need to include cloud coverage. They forget that as the planet heats, being covered by mostly water, clouds will be produced. This is how the planet regulates temperature. I've seen all models looking at one of the weaker greenhouse gases CO2 and ignoring any factor that negates some of those reactions.

It has been otherwise estimated at from 25 to 200 million. The plague began in central to East Asia and followed the silk road into Europe. The Little Ice Age did not cause the plague but it did assist in the spread of it helping to sustain it's spread. Of course the Mongol raids were another force of assistance through China. There are ample records showing how global temperatures in the northern hemisphere had destroyed crops stopping further harvest because nothing would grow. This in turn caused famines all over and everything together, conspired to cause catastrophic deaths. The main cause without doubt was that world temperature had dropped by just one degree.

Black Death link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death ""Historians have argued that cultural responses to the consequences of the Little Ice Age in Europe consisted of violent scapegoating.[36][37][38][34][39] The prolonged cold, dry periods brought drought upon many European communities, resulting in poor crop growth, poor livestock survival, and increased activity of pathogens and disease vectors.[40] Disease tends to intensify under the same conditions that unemployment and economic difficulties arise: prolonged, cold, dry seasons. Both of these outcomes – disease and unemployment – enhance each other, generating a lethal positive feedback loop.""",UCCAHDqWX0Lz32NUGUVcAQ6Q,1,Ugy_hh3vRdEo92_W4jJ4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

This tiny hole of an office is the source of absolute junk science, first developed by James Hansen (former Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Sciences = GISS). Hansen should have his PhD nullified, because it was granted on the basis of junk science (his thesis incorrectly explained the extreme temperatures measured at the surface of Venus, based on his incorrect modeling of warming due to CO2).

That being said, any post made by anyone here can and probably will be responded to by any other person. Like it or not, I chose to respond because you chose to bring up the topic of faithful beliefs without evidence. The study of physics and cosmology for the most part is to explain how things that exist work and very little of it addresses why things work. All of the scientific facts I presented, if you actually understood them, all work against the universe evolving to where it can support life because they all work against the one force of nature that is credited with causing the universe to evolve, gravity, which is the weakest of the four fundamental forces of matter; so extremely weak compared to the other three fundamental forces that science does not bother to even consider it when studying the structure of elements and molecules; the matter that makes up everything that is. And yet the universe did evolve in spite of odds so great they make the universe look really really really extremely small. Which means there is some force somewhere that increased the strength of gravity, in a targeted manner, so that the universe would evolve into what it is today rather than collapse back into the singularity it came from. And since dark energy is causing the expansion of the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, the universe is expected to expand until it suffers what science refers to as a heat death. Which also brings up the question of just where did all of the energy contain in the singularity that the universe expanded from come from if it is not the result of a previous universe collapsing into the singularity our universe came from. So since you voluntarily chose to bring up the subject of “faithful beliefs without evidence,” I chose to present faithful beliefs in spite of evidence that disproves those beliefs. So maybe, with this expanded explanation, you will stop trying to deflect away from the question and the evidence and post a scientifically fact based answer and cite the authoritative source that backs it up.",UCQLlpwcp-ax40rN1AQwg9XA,1,UgyRfjFd3JbyEpKKPeF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

In his book “The Emperor’s New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics,” Sir Roger Penrose gives the odds at 1 in [(10^10)^128]. According to Penrose: ""This is an extraordinary figure. One could not possibly even write the number down in full, in ordinary denary notation: it would be ‘1’ followed by 10^128 successive ‘0’! Even if we were to write a ‘0’ on each separate proton and each separate neutron in the universe – and we could throw in all the other particles as well for good measure – we should fall far short of writing down the figure needed."" ""The Emperor’s New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics"" was written in 1989. Since then it has been discovered that there are billions or trillions more galaxies and thousands of planets in our galaxy have been discovered.

It's influence on the energy absorption still has increased by 45% since 1990. https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide A doubling in the athmospheric CO2 abundance will cause 1,5-4,5 degrees of warming according to scientists. https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/how-much-will-earth-warm-if-carbon-dioxide-doubles-pre-industrial-levels The effect is hereby not immidiate, it could take hundreds if not thousand years to fully take place.

No climate model anywhere can reproduce this history, unless we completely remove CO2 as a climate factor. Math proves all 80 ppm only contributed (at most) +0.00014C of warming over 75 years!

This language was used by political activists trying to evoke fear in the public, thereby getting them to knee-jerk sign a ban of Freon, one of the world’s most effective and economical coolants. The Activists succeeded in killing an entire industry, and garnering Nobel Chemistry prizes for Rowland, Crutzen, and Molina in 1995. Problem? The theory advanced by the trio was scientific balderdash. The idea CFCs (ChloroFluoroCarbons) would release Chlorine radicals, that these radicals would rise through the atmosphere (from ground level to stratosphere) without reacting with either H+ or another ion in the atmosphere, and then sit in the stratosphere for 1000s of years, actively catalyzing a reaction which attacks Ozone in the stratosphere over and over again is laughable. The truth? UV radiation attacks Ozone (O3 molecules) in the stratosphere by first splitting Ozone into atomic oxygen (O) and regular oxygen (O2). Ozone is also formed in the stratosphere when atomic oxygen combines with molecular oxygen (O + O2 = O3). Complicating this simple equilibrium is Nitric Oxide (NO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the stratosphere. Again, UV radiation splits O off from NO2 to form NO. Therefore, there are a complex set of phenomena taking place, and both are driven by solar radiation. The chemistry requires a proper knowledge of atmospheric and solar physics, which may explain why the Chemists didn’t understand what they were studying. Or, they were funded to find some problem with CFCs by political activists in Washington, DC. You decide. During the period of stratospheric ozone thinning at the poles, we had strong solar cycles with higher levels of UV radiation. In the past 20 years, we have had weak solar cycles with lower levels of UV radiation, marking a return of the ozone thickening at the poles. Hmm.

I’m not mad about science, I’m passionate about science staying committed to a discovery of what is true about nature, and how things work. If you wish to discount my scientific observations because I respect those who have dedicated their lives to the task of preserving the translation and original meanings of scripture, then that’s your right. Refuting a scientific argument with ad hominem won’t get you very far in science. Is the Earth young? I don’t know. What I do know is Physics. Gravity does not describe how molecules of gas become dust, nor how particles of dust become rocks, nor how rocks become asteroids, nor how asteroids form planets. My religious background drives my desire to improve our scientific understanding of these processes, because it isn’t acceptable to take the matter on “faith” that this is how the planets formed. That would be no more scientific than accepting the idea “God did it, and that settles it.” I don’t like anyone who presumes to “know” things not in evidence, such as the conclusion Earth is 4.5 Billion years old. Is it? NASA’s Solar System Exploration team says the Solar System is 4.5 Billion years old. Did they make a mistake on their website? How long did it take for Earth to accumulate the material it is made up from? Where did this material come from? Cosmologists tell us the heavier elements must have been created in massive stars, and then injected into the universe when the star went supernova. However, it takes tens of billions of years for any star to go supernova, and the fraction of dense gases (and rocks?) would only add a minuscule amount of material to our solar system, believed to be in a remote part of the Milky Way galaxy. So, I would estimate 568 Billion years would be needed to 1) form stars, 2) age them out in sufficient numbers, 3) accrete the material ejected to form our own solar system. Problem? The Big Bang only happened about 14 Billion years ago. Ergo, we really need better science about the processes which created our solar system and its planets in a rapid manner. Who knows? Maybe someone will discover the Universe isn’t as big as currently believed, which would also make it much younger? Doubtful this would happen in my lifetime or yours, and I can’t imagine a process which would happen in a week, let alone a 24-hour day. Of course, Genesis 1 doesn’t really specify the first or second days were really what we consider a day today. I can imagine a Big Bang happening in a sequence of explosions followed by collapses, resulting in one final, supermassive explosion. This solved the problem of creating the mass needed to form planets in just 14 Billion years. Instead of a hundred million supernovas, and ejected mass somehow accreting into planets, we only need one supermassive black hole. Also squares with a description of the early Earth being “without form, and void.” How did Moses know to record this description, which seems to be correct? How can any Bible author know scientific truths only discovered thousands of years later? By the way, how many different types of animals needed to be on the Ark to produce the variety observed today? I don’t know the answer, but I do know it isn’t nearly as many as you think. Have you ever seen any list of more than a few hundred types of animals? You’re not allowed to count the hundreds of breeds of dogs or cats or horses, etc. Count only the different taxonomic families, although, keep in mind taxonomy wasn’t and isn’t exactly a science, and didn’t start with any understanding of DNA (genomes).",UCOFTy9MED2OJ5Wk6PX_HSvw,1,UgyRfjFd3JbyEpKKPeF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I worry it may be getting colder than it was when we were kids. The 0.5C of warming seen in the satellite record (the only valid, scientific observations for determining global warming & cooling) was due to strong solar cycles closing out the 20th century. So far since 2000, we’ve only had weak solar cycle with extended solar minimums. We’re not at the end of a solar cycle: we’re at the start of solar cycle 25, which should show up this year (if we’re lucky). https://www.livescience.com/new-sunspot-solar-cycle-begins.html If history repeats, we could be facing either a Dalton or a Maunder Minimum. Hold on to your loved ones if that happens. If CO2 causes warming, then we should want as much as possible to be in the atmosphere (to mitigate against the cooling). But perhaps the new solar cycle will be a strong one and we still see global cooling? Does that prove no solar driven climate change? No. One must account for extensive energy reservoirs created through insolation at the ocean surface, mountains, and deserts. Again, the time constant associated with these large heat sinks is significant. Phase analysis has shown the direct correlation between greater solar radiation and global warming.

The largest single energy transfer is the evaporation of water, and thermal convection. This is the energy which cools the ocean surface, and generates the massive amounts of energy fueling hurricanes and tornadoes, thunderstorms and blizzards. Another important energy transfer is conduction. Cool air passing over a heated desert will be warmed by contact. The primary reason radiation is important is because there is no conduction or convection through the vacuum of space between the Sun and the Earth. It is the Sun which drives climate on Earth.

That, and skepticalscience dotcom, John Cook’s bogus website, which had nothing close to either skepticism or science about climate. Every one of those 97% papers is ridiculous. Cook’s paper (not 2004, but 2013), was refuted even as it was being posted on his website. Authors called and complained about getting misrepresented in Cook’s paper. David Legates (Delaware’s official Climate Scientist at the time) tore Cook a new one by illustrating the many false statements and analyses done by Cook and his friends. Zimmerman polled over 10,000 academics (already a skewed population) and only managed to find 75 who were willing to say 1) climate changed, and 2) humans may have played a role in it. That’s it. Zimmerman didn’t study how many scientists believe late 20th century warming was caused solely by consumption of fossil fuels; she didn’t study how many scientists believe there is such a thing as climate change driven by increases in CO2. Zimmerman didn’t study how many scientists disagree with the administrators of their scientific organizations who took funds from the USGCRP to publish nonsensical statements about climate change and CO2. Gallup does believable surveys of public opinions, which are largely measuring how many Liars continue to dominate the media & academia. They can’t seem to crack more than 2/3rds who think humans are more responsible than nature for global warming. These people haven’t bothered to look at published papers critically, or lack the capacity to do so. Science isn’t determined by public opinion. Politicians can Lie about the science of anthropogenic global warming, but they can’t change the truth, no matter how many Lies are told. CO2 in the atmosphere has a lower concentration than Argon — by a factor of 25X. The atmosphere as a whole has mass of only 4 million Gigatonnes. This is compared to a surface mass of 20 billion Gigatonnes (5000X greater). The surface will drive atmospheric temperature in the troposphere, and the troposphere will drive temperature in the stratosphere. Radiation plays a tiny role in moderating atmospheric temperatures. Find any meteorologist or thermal engineer to explain why this is true. Now, since the entire atmosphere does not drive climate, how does a tiny fraction (0.04%) do it? And now, multiply the 0.04% by 0.2%, which is the fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere today which had an anthropogenic source. How does 0.00008% of earth’s atmosphere manage to drive climate when nature can’t??? You who believe in Anthropogenic Global Warming must be scientifically illiterate. Yes AGW is the term, because hiding behind the ambiguous term “Climate Change” isn’t fooling anyone, anymore.",UCOFTy9MED2OJ5Wk6PX_HSvw,1,UgyRfjFd3JbyEpKKPeF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

BS. I was in school in the 1970s and later, and no such statistic is true. As for TIROS, it was indeed launched in the 1960s. But these satellites weren’t making detailed measurements to map temperatures and try to judge when an Ice Age might bury northern latitude cities, like Montreal, Ottawa, Boston, Vancouver, Seattle, Calgary, and even Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis-St Paul. The first satellite launched to study mean global temperature and look at the climate issue was the Nimbus-7, in 1978. It carried a new instrument, called the Earth Radiation Budget (ERB), and took the science of climate study out of the Dark Ages. Unfortunately, illiterates (mostly college professors) continued to conjecture on climate science, and now politics plays an important role in manipulating the scientific data. President George Herbert Walker Bush signed a Bill founding the US Global Change Research Program in 1990. Since then, Billions has been wasted by the USGCRP to convince scientific organizations to embrace the official message: “CO2 poses a danger to future climate.” Political Activists appear to have convinced you of a false history, so you won’t perceive the truth. https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/RemoteSensingAtmosphere/remote_sensing2.php You’re entitled to your opinions, but not your own facts.

Warming causes CO2 to be emitted. This is likely the largest natural source of CO2 emissions, and it dwarfs any contribution from human sources. But not so fast: warming also increases volcanic activity, so the world’s global volcanic emissions of CO2 should increase. This value has been poorly estimated, because 99% of active volcanos are submarine (most on the ocean floor). Warming also benefits plants in temperate and polar climates, which has been a very large sink for atmospheric CO2. It isn’t clear whether global, natural CO2 sinks exceed sources during periods of warming, which is why Leftists are able to falsely accuse human consumption of carbon-based fuels as the primary cause of CO2 increase in the atmosphere.",UCOFTy9MED2OJ5Wk6PX_HSvw,1,UgyRfjFd3JbyEpKKPeF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

All 3280 Gt of CO2 in earth’s atmosphere are credited with only +1.65C of warming by the IPCC. Doubling it can’t possibly cause more than another +1.65C. According to optical saturation physics, adding more CO2 results in diminishing extra warming, so it will require another doubling (that is, quadrupling just to add another +1.65C). Of course, from first principles in physics, it can be demonstrated CO2 in earth’s atmosphere doesn’t add any measurable warming. The sun warms the planets in our solar system, and water vapor in earth’s atmosphere is responsible for 99.86% of the greenhouse warming effect. Basically, you’ll need to review every alleged scientific fact about climate that you were taught in school. Or don’t, and live your life as one of the Leftist’s lackeys.

According to Penrose: ""This is an extraordinary figure. One could not possibly even write the number down in full, in ordinary denary notation: it would be ‘1’ followed by 10^128 successive ‘0’! Even if we were to write a ‘0’ on each separate proton and each separate neutron in the universe – and we could throw in all the other particles as well for good measure – we should fall far short of writing down the figure needed.""

Newly published evidence suggests Mars is experiencing global warming as it emerges from an ice age.

The research was conducted using an instrument on board the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that allowed an unprecedented examination of “the most recent Martian ice age recorded in the planet’s north polar ice cap,” according to a NASA press release. https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/31/mars-also-undergoing-climate-change-ice-age-retrea/",UCBGSh3kifneGqsNbix6qptg,1,UgyRfjFd3JbyEpKKPeF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

However, we had no satellite instrument orbiting the earth to measure earth’s mean temperature in the 1930s. Meanwhile, several global climate models need the 1930s to be cooler than today, because atmospheric CO2 didn’t really start increasing significantly until after 1940 (WWII & post-war economic boom). Worse yet, no person born during the last 22 years has observed any global warming at all, despite nearly half of the CO2 increase measured since the mid-1950s (+44ppm) having occurred during those 22 years. 410-315 = +95ppm.

This held true into the late 70s. That’s when satellites Started monitoring global atmospheric temperatures, although it would be another 20 years before Dr Roy Spencer & Dr John Christy, working with a team of NASA scientists, were able to produce the best scientific record of mean global temperature which is available to date. At first, the record showed warming, and earned Dr Spencer NASA’s highest award for achievement. That was in the late 90s. Fast forward two decades, and the Leftist Lying Lunatics behind this global climate hoax are vilifying Dr Spencer because the satellites now prove beyond any doubt that Climate Models (used to create surface temperature records) are False. This falsification of the CO2/Climate theory is at least the third time in history when otherwise competent scientists have erred in regards to CO2 warming. Tyndall, Arrhenius, and Revelle were all refuted by their peers, and now, the father of modern Global Warming fear-mongering (James Hansen, former director of NASA’s GISS at Columbia U in NYC) has been refuted, along with the Nobel-prize-winning UN IPCC & Al Gore. How are the Climate Models refuted? They all predicted a significantly greater warming, driven by higher levels of atmospheric CO2. According to the most scientific record of atmospheric CO2 levels we can now assert there is no correlation between atmospheric CO2 levels and mean global temperature on time scales stretching from one day to 90 years. Paleoclimate records enable us to assert no correlation over time scales from thousands to billions of years. Sadly, after decades of climate fear-mongering, the only thing we have to show for the Trillion dollars spent are false climate models, prostituted climate scientists, greedy political activists who think they earned the right to become Masters of the Universe, ignorant generations of young folks who have never experienced any global warming at all during their lifetimes, and a Leftist global news journalism intent on preserving the narrative about Climate Change, because their Masters have promised to reward them for helping promote the fear-mongering in regards to fossil fuel consumption.",UCOFTy9MED2OJ5Wk6PX_HSvw,1,UgyRfjFd3JbyEpKKPeF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

If so, think back on the beaches from your childhood and realize they are still there and still the same size. Then recognize that water seeks to remain level, so the sea can't rise in one place and not another. that means that if one beach is still the same size as it was 50-60 years ago, they all are. Also, the only way for seas to rise is for ice on land to melt. Ice in the water melting can't cause a rise in sea levels. If you have a glass of soda with ice in it and you let it sit until the ice melts, does the glass overflow? Of course not. The only places big enough with enough ice to cause sea level rise are Greenland and Antarctica. The ice is not decreasing in either place and in fact, it's growing in the Antarctic. So you can go back to being scared of other things, like the way you've imagined islands disappearing.",UCU4ZKJ8KVhpew_VmA5LkPYg,1,Ugzss0D_W9TAnLQlL0B4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

So, for at least 4 million years we've had about 40 ice ages. During that time, 80-90% of the time we have been in an ice age. We are overdue for the next one and that's the saddest thing I can think to write. The world has been warming primarily because we are coming out of the last ice age and the little ice age before we go into the next one. Think of it: everything will change, especially geography. The Great Lakes were created by the last ice age. Will they be there after the next one? Probably not. New York City, Chicago, the Great Plains, the Chesapeake Bay, etc. won't be part of earth's geography. And 50-80% of humans will die from starvation. Maybe 100 million people will come out of the next one. It's horrific. Global warming is plain old bullshit being used to manipulate people.

Unless a company must fend off competitors who develop new & better ideas, they will have zero incentive to lower the price of their own (inferior) product. General Electric is a perfect example.

Think the Obama administration and HRC’s Democrat party did anything less immoral and illegal when they wire-tapped Trump’s campaign headquarters? Dirty little secret is this practice has been in place since the 1930s, when FDR instituted it.

If you don’t know the atmospheric volume, it’s very difficult to know it’s mass. We do have reasonably good estimates, but at the end of the day, they’re still only estimates.

I provided a very rational approach to the question of whether or not CO2 drives climate. However, empiricists are equally satisfied by satellite measurements which have failed to show the warming predicted by global climate models. You likely think some 97% of scientists believe atmospheric CO2 drives global climate. That’s false. Look up the records of those surveys, and you’ll learn what they really measured. In any case, I posted with certainty because there’s no doubt in my mind about the science here. But you don’t have to accept it yourself. Indeed, you should study this for yourself (if you can). The atmosphere does not have a measurable mass, so it is equally impossible to know the CO2 mass is 3280 Gt. However, this statistic has never been refuted. It comes from assuming the 410 ppmv statistic is correct (Scripps Observatory observational record), and the statistic 5.15E+18 kg is a close estimate of the earth’s atmospheric mass. Since air has an average mass of 28.97 g/mol, and CO2 is 44.01 g/mol, one must convert from volume to mass using a factor 44.01/28.97 = 1.52. Therefore, 410 ppmv becomes 622.85 ppmg. Multiply by 5.15E+18 to get 3207.70 Gt. The math is greatly simplified by increasing CO2 level to 3280 Gt, which enables an “easy” calculation 3280 Gt / 410 ppmv = 8 Gt / ppmv. The closer approximation is 7.82 Gt / ppmv. Back in 1955, when the CO2 level was 315 ppmv, one may derive total atmospheric CO2 = 2464 Gt. This yields an average annual CO2 increase = 3207.7 - 2464.5 = 743.25 / 65 years = 11.43 Gt / year. I rounded this up to 16 Gt with simplified math. So, 11.43 / 7.82 = +1.46 ppmv. Of course, the actual record is nonlinear, but this only makes the lack of correlation between CO2 and global warming even less likely. Higher temperatures in the 1930s were “adjusted” out of existence in the “official” HadCRUT record (Hadley Centre, U. of East Anglia, Norwich, England). The last 22 years have lacked any observational warming, except in records boosted by global climate model projected temperatures. Satellites failed to show warming during the 20 years when they should have shown more than the late 20th century.",UCOFTy9MED2OJ5Wk6PX_HSvw,1,Ugx2lB0XOsohZS2sxLF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

The Biggest corporations (the ones with huge, multi-billions in quarterly profits) are Big Oil. Top executives in Big Oil quietly invest in Solar & Wind power startups, and start shutting down facilities which are aimed at developing fossil fuels. This reduces their carbon footprint and “earns” them carbon credits. Who pays for these credits? We do, including every small business seeking to grow, except those who are funding the non-competitive Wind & Solar companies. See, the small business seeking to expand must necessarily increase its carbon footprint! Brilliant: it’s a Communist wet dream designed to stifle all free market entrepreneurs and eliminate incentives at the root of all real free markets, and replace them with a Gov’t-controlled pseudo-market! Supplement such fake markets with fake money, and theoretically, you can enslave the entire world’s population for the enrichment of the “Masters of the Universe” (Leftists running the One World Gov’t, and leading the New World Order).

Greenhouse gases exist are being emitted by man&#39;s civilisation in ever increasing amounts and absorb IR radiation at bandwidths that have been detected both in the laboratory and in the field. The IR brightening of the sky has been measured now for over 30 years. Saunter&#39;s climate modelling studies in the 90s predicted the &#39;fingerprints&#39; of our emissions- regional differences. Mann&#39;s work shows that the Earth reached peak temps some 5000-6000 years ago and was cooling very slowly over this time period as one would expect in an interglacial. However, since 1750 the Earth&#39;s atmosphere has heated almost 1.5 C and since 1880 about 1.1 C as over one trillion tons of CO2 has been emitted since the Industrial Revolution began. Also, C isotope studies also confirm that the source is anthropogenic...mostly from coal as we are burning about 9 billion tons each year to generate power. This isn&#39;t rocket science folks! The greenhouse effect is a fact and physicists calculated long ago that without it our planet would be an ice ball. The simple truth is we are putting far more CO2, CH4, N2O, O3, and CFCs nto the system than it can absorb and there are consequences in a deterministic Universe. Same thing in economics. Speculation and debt is beyond control and we all know that the stock market is significantly inflated. We&#39;ve got about 10 years I figure until it all falls apart. In a world of fiat currency, speculative trading of 2 trillion per day in the world&#39;s casino economy with about 270 trillion in debt and national and household debt out of control it can&#39;t last long.

But regarding the 12000 studies that confirmed through the article. You addressed in your video how a large number of them presented no opinion one way or the other. But the study addressed this as well. I'm curious if you read their explanation of why so many of the studies didn't present an explanation? Because I do believe they over inflated their findings by not explaining that, but I also think that you under represented them by not explaining that. It's the same manipulation of numbers, just in different directions. It also only asserts that 'humans are responsible for climate change', not that we're about to kill the planet in the next ten years.

Alarmists want the public to have views on climate change regardless of their academic background. They don't ask for Al Gore's scientific credentials, or Justin Trudeau's. But when an informed lay person criticizes the orthodoxy, suddenly they demand to see your diploma. Well, I have a PhD in history, a broad discipline that tries to understand the present and predict the future by looking at the past. Which seems like a sensible approach to climate alarmism's claim that, for instance, CO2 drives temperature. If it didn't before 1970, why would it afterwards. So I encourage everyone to have informed opinions on all sorts of public policy issues from taxes and deficits to national security even if they aren't, say, formally certified economists or generals.

Scientists are able to tell us of times when Northern Europe, America and Asia had virtually tropical weather patterns. There is nothing that indicates that those weather patterns existed because of, or in spite of any human intervention. Whatever should cause us to think that the Earth would remain in the state in which we have ""always known it"", despite our temporary existences of a mere ""three score years and ten"". Even our earliest records are a ""mere drop in the ocean"". The Earth, our Solar System and the Universe as we know it, will never be in perpetual stasis. Unfortunately students are skipping school, to protest about issues they cannot yet sufficiently know about. Thus reducing the education component that should allow them to be able to deal with the very real issues that face them in the future. It is certainly my hope that students of today will learn how to deal with, first of all, human abuse (intellectual, physical and otherwise, in all its various guises), the trash issue, re-afforestation, water and power supply and distribution or use in situ, and a huge number of other worth-while goals and objectives, including exploration beyond our own atmosphere.

That means there is a substantial (not overwhelming) margin of error in whatever data you are analyzing. As you look into the future, the margin of error necessarily increases. Therefore trying to analyze 10 or 20-years down the road the actions taken today is virtually impossible. IMO, smart money says we invest in appropriate research.

How you remove the politics from the science is equally difficult and I would have to look to someone smarter than me to find a resolution.

How is there no comment made of the greater of number of survey recipients who don&#39;t respond to these surveys and why not?? These questionnaires/surveys are ALWAYS filled with leading questions and only made to draw answers specifically for their own purpose. Universities, who employ scientists and their research projects are all sponsored by big companies like pharma, oil companies, mining companies (and funded by governments - no right agenda, no funding whatever your faculty), etc. as are governments and the media. They are all owned/bought, to some degree or another, by these big companies. <br /><br /><br /> Trusting a survey is like trusting a thief with your wallet. Every response or lack of response comes from a position of influence by mostly the huge companies that really own and run our universities, governments, communities, cities, states, countries and definitely our scientists. Research grants and the like in universities funnel academics and their students of note into their fold, both in person and contractually bindly so. Their voice has been bought the second they win this grant/funding. The big companies then own the rights of these discoveries. (The discoveries hidden on backroom shelves simply because they threaten the economy the products and economy of big business I&#39;m sure would be astounding). They have all sold their souls to the devil. A public voice against anything these scientists might believe or disbelieve is now silenced, bought; lost. The activists too, unfortunately, all too often come from a position of bias. However, It could be argued they are, at the very least, keeping the bastards honest. Oh, if only this were true. The bastards are as corrupt now as they ever have been and getting worse. <br /><br /><br /> Data at best, is bullshit manipulated further. Even this video is made with a point of view in mind. What is the political mindset of the producers? Who is funding them? What is their objective with the selectively of chosen data included and omitted?? For what reason is this so??? Who initiated the making of this video and why? Their political and/or religious persuasion? The outcome of a survey is manipulated before it goes to paper and is again when it is read and again when an answer is supplied to it. It is further manipulated when the information is collated and yet again when it&#39;s results are communicated back to us, that is the parts of it they want us to here. It is true, data doesn&#39;t lie but boy oh boy its manipulators do again and again. They all have an agenda. For example during this video, the result of a survey is referred to and it ignores the greater number to concentrate on the opposite point of view which is the lesser percentage by a significant amount, and talks only about that outcome. Data is collected to be manipulated; mined and what we all need to remember is that it is only the real purpose of the miner of this data that will point to the real objective here. The offshoot of all of this is, as soon as you hear anyone starts to mention data, cry bullshit, ignore the data and look more closely to what their purpose for trying to manipulate you in that direction might be?? Newton invented Ether to make his theory work, he had no proof, just a guess, a fiction to explain a falsity believed for how long . . . ??? <br /><br /><br />Today you can&#39;t trust a scientist one way or the other and as for the governments, activists and how the media reports it to us all . . . it is all a manipulated lie behind which are the big companies and their bought cronies of implementation; the politicians and the media who deceive us every given day. It&#39;s all irony . . . <br /><br /><br />However, you cannot tell me that a fire I light doesn&#39;t affect the environments in my direct vicinity. You cannot tell me a larger fire doesn&#39;t affect a greater area and that the burning of mineral and chemical and toxins on a mass scale world wide has no impact, you cannot surely believe there is no impact on our Earth?? People talk of the ice melts and ocean rising, who mentions the billion if not trillions of tons and or more that we pour into our oceans every day, every month, year, decade, for millennia but in the last 100 years compounding more so. You cannot tell me this has no impact on the balance of how our Earth and all which lives upon it, including us, is not affected??? What we spew into our breathable air; our atmosphere, the forests we fell, the species we lose, the earth we move from one place to another; the imbalance??? You cannot tell me that all of this combined over the years, decades, centuries, is not affecting the balance??? How critical is this balance???? What is the tipping point??? Almost nil? Some? More? A great deal? Totally? <br /><br /><br />Whatever the case, if we agree there is an impact, aren&#39;t we always better to look out for the very foundation we stand on as first and foremost on our list of priorities or will it always be the blinding light of the dollar made and at whatever the cost, that will always be far greater than universally combined common sense that knows we need to put the very environment that sustains us as the highest value in the order of things and categorically first.

Almost all life on the planet has adapted to survive in a wide range of temperatures. Even a 4-5 degree increase isn&#39;t dangerous. Most life is adapted to survive swings as great as 50 - 150 degrees as we go through the seasons from summer to winter. <br /> <br />The real fear is that global warming will raise sea levels. But here are the facts. The arctic ice is sea ice. It already displaces the ocean as much as it ever will. Even if the entire arctic were to melt the sea level wouldn&#39;t rise even 1 millimeter. In order to raise sea levels by any appreciable degree the Antarctic ice would have to melt. <br /> <br />The first question to ask is what is the melting point of ice? Everyone knows it&#39;s 32 degrees F. <br /> <br />The next question is what is the average temperature of Antarctica? -56 degrees F. <br /> <br />Well what is the average summer temperature of Antarctica? -10 degrees F. <br /> <br />Unless the laws of physics change and ice starts melting at much lower temperatures it&#39;s impossible for the Antarctic ice to melt and impossible for the global sea level to rise by any appreciable extent. <br /> <br />Not surprisingly even during periods in earths history that were much much warmer than today the Antarctic ice didn&#39;t melt. <br /> <br />So if there is no chance we are about to be inundated by rising ocean levels, then what are people so worried about? <br /> <br />You would think the alarmists would at least take the time to double check the melting point of ice against the temperature in Antarctica before making absurd predictions that have no chance of ever coming true.",UCgiNs7gCxEvgBE1HHvoOKTQ,0,UgwUH2w_bZ0iKmhpptB4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

There's no science of ""climatology"" that makes you simultaneously an expert in all the technical fields related to climate in ways that mere physicists and biologists and geologists are not. But at some point we all have to get out of our silos to get an overview of the issue. As people often point out as though it were a badge of shame, I'm a historian. Which means that I look at the history of Earth's climate for clues as to what is likely to happen in the future and why. Like geologists, among others. And I appreciate what the technical people do.

Globally, we generate over 10 billion tons of CO2 annually, and we know it has a warming effect. We know that over the last 800,000 years, CO2 levels have varied from 180 to about 280 ppm during natural climate cycles, and that today it is at 425 ppm. We&#39;ve risen 1 degree Celsius in about a century, and during normal climate cycles that change takes about 7,000 years. We know what causes natural climate change and that the planet should be entering a slow cooling period, yet it is warming; something is overriding the natural climate cycle; this is not natural variation. We know it is not changes in solar energy output. If you want to say it isn&#39;t human activity, then you need to offer an alternate hypothesis, but you can&#39;t, because all other possible causes have been ruled out. Weather is not the same thing as climate, and climatology is a science; there are climatologists. Survey climatologists instead of meteorologists, and let us know if you find consensus. How many countries are members of the Paris Accord? All of them (197). How many intend to back out? One. The new head of the EU intends to accelerate emission cutting, and China is ahead of their pledge. She talked about sanctions and trade barriers for countries not pulling their weight. That could get interesting. If we reverse fuel standards, our cars will no longer sell overseas; coal mining continues to fall despite deregulation, because of market forces. There are 10 times more jobs in clean energy than there are in coal. Apple now produces 80% of its corporate power needs. There are zealots who predicted radical change over short periods of time a few decades ago, especially about sea levels, but the predictions from the actual scientific community have been quite accurate, and the models continue to improve.

If the oil and gas had not been used, where would all the plastics have come from (which sadly, humans dump in landfill sites, rivers, and the sea!)? Where have many of the oil-based chemicals, tar, medicines, food additives, etc. etc. come from? (See a partial list of 6,000 products made from oil at <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/partial-list-over-6000-products-made-from-one-barrel-oil-steve-pryor%C2%A0).%C2%A0"">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/partial-list-over-6000-products-made-from-one-barrel-oil-steve-pryor ). </a> How would we have produced the energy we have used? How would we have transported food and goods around the planet...by horse and cart and rowing boats? How would we have heated and cooled our homes? Well, we could have cut down ALL of the trees I suppose...It is bad enough that we have cut down most of the trees in most countries and in particular around the tropics where the tree cover historically controlled the world climate! Those living in or near or visiting the rainforest will be aware of how tropical rains are absorbed by the trees very quickly after a storm since each tree can absorb its own weight in water. Evaporation in the rainforest helps to keep the temperature down, particularly in the tropics, whereas cleared land retains the radiant heat of the sun. Then look at the main real current proximate cause of climate change... THE POLE SHIFT!  A great resume of the global warming scam can be seen at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyig6r8lgWE&amp;t=14s%C2%A0;"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyig6r8lgWE&amp;t=14s ; </a><br />Of greater effect on the world, the extreme climate change is hastened by the destruction of the forest, particularly around the tropics where lack of trees to absorb the sun&#39;s radiation causes tropical (not global) warming and the absorption of much more moisture from the tropical seas as a result of higher air and sea temperature. Global solar minimum records may have been a guide to future climate from past records, however, the effects of the pole shift are altering global conditions and projections from historic records and cycles. At the last GSM, we were not experiencing the extreme temperatures and extreme weather events now being recorded! Also, we did not experience such a huge increase in earthquakes and volcanic activity. (Sometimes as many as 4000 earthquakes over 2.5 on the Richter scale each month instead of 200, 16 years ago and over 70 erupting volcanoes each month as opposed to 3, 16 years ago.) Huge cracks and sink-holes have also increased year by year in the last 16 years as a result of the stress on the crust from the current crustal slip.  <br /> <br />So one cause for the escalation of extreme weather events is simple... fewer trees in the tropics each year....less to absorb the sun&#39;s radiation = tropical warming (NOT GLOBAL WARMING!). Higher temperature around the tropics = more moisture evaporated from the oceans producing much warmer, denser and increased cloud production (hence more flooding in tropics where tree cover is reduced).....then more and denser ‘tropical rainforest clouds’ carrying more moisture, escape the tropics as intense heat on cleared land creates lift to allow these clouds to escape the tropics on trade winds...hence regional cooling effect away from the tropics as cloud cover increases and increased rain and snowfall away from the tropics, whilst extra cloud cover also traps the extra heat traveling up from the tropics. Fewer trees in the tropics each year = less biomass to sequester the CO2.  As the ocean warms, the warmer seas travel north to the Arctic and south to the Antarctic. As warmer air from the tropics travels north and south, the air is warmer in the Arctic and in the Antarctic....simples!’ The warmer air and seas distorts the position of the jet stream pushing it north towards west Canada and north towards the UK but there is a counteractive force pushing the jet stream south at some geographical locations as a result of the increase in cloud cover escaping the Tropics, which cools some areas of the ocean through reduced radiation from the sun.  Nature operates its own controls. Cut down and burn the trees and the increase in CO2 inspire nature to inspire more growth to absorb and balance the CO2 bank. <br /> <br />So what is happening at the geographic poles? Arctic melting = more cold water escaping the north. Pole shift causing the magnetic north pole to move towards Siberia = the cold waters of the Kara and East Siberian sea also moving into the Atlantic. As Siberia moves up to the new geographical northern point, the colder air of northern Siberia is also moving towards the Atlantic, USA and Europe with the jet stream. (Low temperatures are retained better by landmasses!) As North America moves south, the Jet stream is distorted by the cold water and air from the melting Arctic, the cold water from the Kara and East Siberian Sea as well as the northern tip of Siberia which has had -83 degrees recorded in winter 2017-18 and domestic and wild animals freezing to death, just as the many animals that froze to death in previous cold periods.   <br /> <br />Much of the hysteria about seasonal climate change forget that climate is driven by the seasons and the geographical position of the sun throughout the year. Cloud generation and therefore flooding accelerates when the sun crosses the equator and cloud generation increases as it follows the sun, providing localized seasonal changes in rainfall on changing seasonal regional land surfaces. It is often said by some that cosmic radiation causes cloud nucleation, however, the moisture/humidity has to exist if indeed new cloud is formed by this method. World weather maps generated from satellite data, confirm that the amount of cloud generated around the tropics has increased exponentially, with the loss of forest and as a result of landmass displacement following of the current crustal displacement caused by the current pole shift. <br /> <br />Currently, the immense mass of the core continues to spin in its historic attitude. The crust is slipping...north America southwards and Australia northwards. Hence Mexico, California and southern US states, as well as Australia, are moving towards the equator where droughts and forest fires are increasing year by year. Florida and the Florida keys are seeing seawater ingress up the drains at high tide and Louisiana backwaters are now full of saltwater as these areas approach the bulge of the ocean at the tropics distorted by the oscillation of the moon and sun north and south of the equator. The Louisiana freshwater shrimp fisheries have collapsed as a result. This localized sea-level rise has been increasing during the past 16 years as a result of the pole shift. With the forest areas of Amazon, Philippines and Indonesia moving away from the tropics, falling tree cover has increased tropical temperature (not global warming) and increased moisture absorption from tropical seas. Hence more and denser cloud generation around the tropics providing additional moisture for the flooding and snowfall on the increase over the past 16 years, north and south of the equator. Sadly this has also contributed to regional colder air north and south of the equator since the increased cloud cover has prevented warmth reaching the Earth&#39;s surface.",UC5Kidgpkk3WR33qYsCkF2mQ,0,UgwynJd5DC9XngucnIt4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Why would the government need to fund such work, if there’s no crisis? So Will, how long have you studied this issue? Start by recognizing no scientist anywhere ever says “the debate is over”. We don’t “debate”. Research attempts to establish what’s true about natural phenomena: that is, discover the laws governing physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics.

In Scotland we had a wind turbine's rotor fly off at a mere 40mph wind. Fast winds can damage them, hence the need to shut them down. And like you say, the overload on the system by producing too much power due to fast winds. That said, they run at between 25%-33% of their full capacity over the course of a year. Very low. It's often peddled that they are so efficient and have a high capacity. That's how politicians sell them. The reality falls far short of it. A simple Google search can tell you the running capacities of windmills, even of individual ones. One of our local ones averages 21% annually. I'll quote: ""According to the EIA in 2016, the most recent year for which complete data is available, the [US] federal government spent just shy of $14 billion in energy subsidies and support.  Subsidies for renewable energy totaled $6.682 billion, while those for fossil energy totaled a mere $489 million"". Lots of subsidies there. However, green energies produced only 9.44% of the total energy output in 2017, whereas coal gas and oil produced 62% of the US energy output. Massive discrepancy there. Shows how economically inefficient renewables are. They would not survive without subsidies",UCkG3kvos3klN9PoeiL3q0EA,1,UgyN4-KMOU3Gty9ZZmB4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I've seen it in my local area with my own eyes. The rotational momentum would destroy them. You can YouTube videos of when they didn't shut them down. They are cheaper because of subsidies, masses of government subsidies and tax cuts. The indirect cost through our taxes that fund them is much, much higher. Even if we did build loads of windmills and solar panels, it still wouldn't stop politicians from being corrupt and... Dramatising all of this to fill their pockets. What do you define as efficient? 28% of full running capacity is pretty inefficient output wise. Not being able to pay for themselves and relying on governments (or actually, taxpayers) to make up the slack is inefficient economically. They would run at a loss if it wasn't for subsidies.

The entire set up would not need to be much bigger than a house. Good breakthroughs have already been made here. The cost to benefit ratio of renewables is pretty low. Take windmills. Running at full capacity all the time, they would be better than they are in practice. However, they tend to run at about 28% of full capacity on average here in the UK across the whole year. Too little wind and they don't run. Too much and they also have to be shut down so that they don't break. Very inefficient. What leads to investment into these inefficient green energies is government subsidies and tax breaks for large corporations - which comes out of taxpayer pockets and drives up our energy prices. I find it ironic - those who claim to want to redistribute the wealth back to the poor are often the same who are helping make the rich richer and the poor poorer. With themselves in the former category. The windmills are an eyesore and kill lots of birds. A simple search can show you videos of eagles and other birds flying and having their wings broken by the rotors. It not uncommon. I agree with you that we need to change from oil and gas to a better source of fuel that is efficient, economical and environmental. I don't see wind or solar farms on a mass scale offering that. It would require a very large amount of additional infrastructure and systems to be able to support it properly, with the required maintenance and people in place to keep it going. Small scale, great for a family, business or small community. Large scale, a poor allocation of resources that falls short of the goal it purports to aspire to The main topics of climate change discussions... Sigh. The original intention that draws people in is a better world and better environment.

There are far better ways to fill in the gaps. Just like there are times when there's not enough renewables there are times when there's too much. You use those times of plenty to fill up storage devices, pumped hydro for example, batteries are another, there are already massive batteries on the grid, they react far faster than gas turbines, coal etc. Then as more and more EV come online with smart charging and v2g they can be tied together through software to also fill the gaps and reduce load on the grid at key moments.

Local areas with lots of sun, great to have solar panels. But most of the world isn't like that.

Well, Al Gore certainly made a lot of money selling his newly invented carbon credits, as did many of his friends. Prince Philip has invested in carbon credits a lot I was surprised to find. They did a negligible amount to actually reduce CO2 emissions. But by placing big taxes on companies - who then have to increase their prices otherwise they will go bankrupt - carbon credits have made things more expensive for the common working man. The Paris Accords likewise funneled money into the hands of very rich people while doing little to combat the genuine pollution around the world. China alone puts more plastic into the oceans than all the western countries combined. It also creates hideous amounts of pollution. One of the holes in the ozone layer was traced back to them! I'm not joking when I say that rivers have been known to catch fire in china because industrial waste is tipped directly into them. Yet I very rarely see that brought up in any mainstream discussions. If they really cared so much for the climate, they'd take China to task and then help third and second world countries develop, so that they can stop worrying about whether they will have food or clean water to eat and drink, and have the space to care for the environment long term. That will reduce pollution a lot actually. If I had to choose one country to help, it would be China. Biggest polluter worldwide. Reducing that pollution by say even 25%, and we'll make a very marked change to the world's pollution outputs. Funnily enough.... The Paris Accords have allowed China to peak it's pollution by... 2030 I think it was. So they have set allowances for more pollution from the biggest polluter. So in light of that, I see that the politicised discussions about ""the world ending in 12 years"" or ""all coast lines flooded in 10"" that they reinvent every decade or so, are nothing more than smoke and mirrors. They don't actually do much to genuinely help improve the quality of the environment or most people's lives Aside from the 200 plus arsonists who set fire to Australia, I don't think human made global warming is as bad as its made out to be.

Countries of the world co-operated and we reduced ozone depleting chemicals from use and a number of decades later we have seen improvements to upper atmospheric ozone. job well done.<br />Meanwhile those that rely on making a lot of money from releases of oil coal and gas figured this was time to make sure they discredit the science on CO2 and Methane because it will cost them some profits, and they went out and bought as many politicians as they could and fund vids like this piece of crap to try to affect public opinion. Nice choices of music - but that doesn&#39;t change the facts. If it is 97% or 95 % of climate scientists is not the point people. We saw a small percentage of ozone depleting chemicals caused a huge problem with the atmosphere, and we were able to correct it, no economic melt down occured and we are all better off today for those decisions five decades ago.<br />Releasing Carbon that was trapped in the earth form millions of years, all in the span of a few hundred years will have an effect.

Now imagine the 7,8 billion people of the world all using these sequestered fossil fuels day after day after day in the big garage we call our planet&#39;s atmosphere. No difference, it is going to affect us all.<br />As a final thought- fossil fuels will run out, eventually, both &quot;sides&quot; (the 97% and the 3%) agree on this, so eventually we have to change to something else ANYWAY - so the only thing we are really addressing is When. to me it is clear, we can change now, or when it is too late.",UCwg-Mjj0XOSSKV9-_u6gSQQ,0,UgyGKYBChRFagSvFjN94AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

But what do we really know&quot;? From proxy ice core data, climate has been changing constantly through several ice ages over earth&#39;s long history. The science tells us that CO2 in the past has been 10 times what it is now. Moreover, temperature and atmospheric CO2 are never in sync. Anyone remember the Y2k bug and the many doomsayers&#39; catastrophic predictions that never came true? Large corporations spent billions bc &quot;expert&quot; consultants said they could fix the &quot;problem&quot;, only to see the &quot;apocalypse&quot; come and go with barely a whimper.<br />As for the climate &quot;experts&quot; If u want irrefutable &quot;proof&quot; of the stupidity that man&#39;s contribution to CO2 is warming the earth i.e. Correlation being proof of Causation, consider this analogy. Shark attacks show exactly the same binomial distribution in summer as ice cream consumption . Fact is fossil fuel represents on 3% of atmospheric CO2 (prof Ian Plimer_. The latter is not a pollutant but the reason while all carbon based lifeforms like us exist and thrive. If the alarmist get their way and halve CO2 , plants begin to die and we follow not long after.

I agree - CNN (a news outlet, not a scientific body) was wrong. But I also disagree: a majority (depending on the data the video provides itself, varying from 52% - 82%) of climate experts still share a consensus view that a) climate change is real and b) human activity plays a significant role.<br /><br />As for whether climate change is a dangerous threat or not, I invite you to read about the &#39;runaway greenhouse effect&#39;. It&#39;s basically a positive feedback loop where warming leads to more warming which leads to more warming ... which leads to an uninhabitable planet. This is obviously a worst case scenario and thus very unlikely, but answers the question that yes, climate change can be dangerous (not taking into account the more realistic consequences such as increased power and frequency of tropical storms, flooding, droughts etc). As such it should be taken seriously and should be considered in policy decisions.<br /><br /><br />Watching this video has made me realise that yes, it is at least possible that I&#39;ve been hoodwinked by a mass media conspiracy promoting a fear of climate change to push for greener technologies. But even if that is the case (which I don&#39;t think it is) I think it&#39;s better than the alternative (which is that climate change is real and we do nothing to prevent it). Let&#39;s look at some potential scenarios, A and B. Scenario A: climate change is real. Scenario B: climate change is not real.<br /><br /><br />Scenario A<br />1. We prepare: the effects of climate change are mitigated.<br />2. We don&#39;t prepare: global temperatures soar, resulting with its associated dangers (floods, crop failure, drought, famine, mass migrations, loss of coastal areas ... potential runaway greenhouse effect).<br /><br /><br />Scenario B<br />1. We prepare: economies invest heavily into green technologies &#39;for no reason&#39; (still benefit from cleaner air and less environmental damage from mining etc)<br />2. We don&#39;t prepare: life continues as always.<br /><br /><br />In both scenarios, option 1 is better. Feel free to reply with your own version(s) of scenarios A/B option 1/2 if you think I&#39;m being unfair with my assumptions here.

Really you need to look at geological time so you get a better understanding. For example: we are currently in an ice age. Yes, that's right an ice age. Within ice ages you get periods of warming and periods of cooling referred to as interglacial and glacial periods. We are in an interglacial (ie warming period). These periods are caused by the tilt of the earth, wobbling around the earth's axis and also by movement of the tectonic plates. After the interglacial period we are in comes to an end we will enter a cooling period when it might be a bit handy to have some extra CO2 around so we don't all freeze to death.

Even the earlier models from the 1980s have proven themselves as surprisingly accurate, however they have tended to be a bit too conservative and have either underestimated the reaction to forcings and feedbacks, or whose highest error bars have coincided with the lowest error bars in actual observation. Of course water vapour is the biggest greenhouse gas, and that's what makes it a concern because it's concentration on average is dictated by air temperature. Scientists expect the feedback forcing of water vapour to increase by 7% for every 1 degree C rise in temperature from CO2 forcing. That's more than just significant, and explains why we're already 1 degree higher today than before the industrial age even though CO2 concentrations are not yet doubled. For your sun issue, here is a recent NASA graph showing the trend of the suns energy reaching earth to the average global temperatures for the last several decades: https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/189/graphic-temperature-vs-solar-activity/ Scientists know about the heat island effect (not just the alt-right bloggers). The methodology used to adjust and/or exclude such data is well documented and not under dispute in the scientific community. Your children should be very angry and scared. I'd be freaking if I wasn't nearly 60 years old. But I was very lucky. I had the opportunity to see a diversity and abundance of life in my youth that doesn't exist today.

And every single one has failed to correctly predict anything. It is a basic tenant of science, that if a theory is not able to accurately predict an outcome or cannot be verified through testing/observation then it is false. The “models” that assume that CO2 level is a GW prime forcer; driving global temperature are the ones which are the most inaccurate. Most of the &quot;models&quot; assume temperature sensitivity to CO2 which is ridiculously high and this is not supported by science at all. It&#39;s been PROVEN that CO2 levels only rise after temperatures has already risen with a lag time of 800 years. CO2 has been put foremost as the global warming driver for political reasons, and until the fraudsters get rid of this &quot;the science is settled&quot; attitude (in an attempt to shut down further discussion), they will continue to be proven wrong. The severe credibility erosion, to the powers that be, of the “models” being consistently proven wrong, has led to several fraudulent acts.. Firstly, bodies such as NASA, NOAA and East Anglia University (to name just three) have actually falsified climate data. The latter has had emails leaked documenting complicity with the IPCC showing clear intention to falsify data reporting. Secondly, they kick the can down the road with erroneous predictions which had become due in say 2010 just get extended to say 2025. They just keep extending the timeline before it comes due and claim that they have &quot;tweaked&quot; the model and it&#39;ll all be spot on in 2025. New York will be underwater in 2025 as opposed to 2012. Thirdly, when they have insufficient data points, NASA and NOAA in particular, just plug in extrapolated climate data from the very “model” they are using. So they input data which has already been skewed with all its erroneous assumptions preloaded (GIGO), like a dog eating its own vomit. Fourthly, they truncate the historical data to exclude periods of greater warmth than today, to make it look like a warming spike and not part of a cooling-warming-cooling-warming natural cycle. This is what generated the infamous (and totally discredited) Mann “Hockey Stick”. Many “models” have excluded the Medieval Warm Period (300 years long) but include temperature data from the Mini Ice Age using “data smoothing” to not draw attention to the fact that as recently as 1250 AD, the medieval pre-industrial world was much warmer than it is now. And in the 17thand18th Century, much colder. Now that’s what I call an inconvenient truth.",UCnTRrw0MKQrJ33gbuwGKEsA,0,UgyhR9QuXzKA9Z6CaWZ4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Ball had been a professor of geography at the University of Winnipeg and knew a thing or two about historical climate change, including the medieval warm period and the so-called 'climate optimum.' He could see Weaver, a computer modeller, knew very little about historical climatology and mentioned it in an online article he wrote. Weaver said Ball defamed him, but really Weaver's suit was designed to shut Ball up and keep him out of the climate debate (SLAPP = Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation). Shortly after filing his SLAPP suit, Weaver became the leader of the British Columbia Green Party and enjoyed a pivotal role in BC politics. In contrast, Tim Ball was vilified as a 'climate change denier', a pejorative term akin to 'Holocaust denier'. The story has a happy ending though: after a long legal battle, a judge dismissed Weaver's suit.

Busses and trucks that used to spew thick acrid black smoke out of their tailpipes from burning diesel fuel with no exhaust controls now burn clean natural gas (I don't mean every one of them). Our cities used to suffer from SMOG. It was very seriously unhealthy to go into the city in the summer in 1970. Our factories must return cleaner water to rivers than they take out and our rivers are now mostly swimmable instead of cancer causers. There has been an enormous decrease in air pollution. The hero is the American citizen who pays twice what he would have for a car had things not changed. We have also paid huge gasoline taxes ostensibly to clean the environment. And we've done these things along with many others gladly without complaint for the most part. Catalytic converters alone cost consumers billions of dollars. Smaller more efficient engines have cost us billions as well. I could go on. But guys like you always want more and you downplay anything we've done on behalf of the environment.

I agree that humans have contributed to the planet being polluted by discard of our waste, because we live in a world that turned into a throw away society. Most of the cheap junk from China and India etc. Is a short term use product, cheaper to discard and replace, than repair. From personal experience we purchased a microwave oven with what used to be a reputable brand name and shortly after the basic warranty expired the oven failed, so upon contacting the toll free customer complaints number they stated that the product would be cheaper to replace than repair and since the warranty had expired that all they could do was give us a replacement for a half price discount and suggested we buy the extended warranty this time. Being a bit POed about that I checked a couple of repair shops, indeed it was cheaper to get the discounted replacement. Being mechanically inclined I decided to open it up and check out what failed using an ohmmeter. I immediately discovered that it was a failed power input fuse, which is there to prevent the electronics from power overload. Replaced the fuse which cost under 5 dollars and has worked fine since then approximately 3 years ago. 😉🍻",UCp8DFRqOi0khHFPDKa0EdDw,1,Ugz0gSkCG2fFqMWyQAV4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

The current CO2 concentration is now approaching close to two times that early base-line level. Much evidence indicated that the earth's climate will go into a very unstable state if the level continues to rise above the current concentration of 415 parts-per-million in the atmosphere. if you encounter other climate science denial sites, such act this one, expect to be bombarded with lies and misinformation, both by the presenters and most of the commenters.

By Valerie Richardson - The Washington Times - Tuesday, May 31, 2016 Earth isn’t the only planet grappling with climate change, although this other orb doesn’t have much in the way of fossil fuel emissions or a 97 percent of scientific “consensus” on global warming. Newly published evidence suggests Mars is experiencing global warming as it emerges from an ice age. The red planet, which moved closer to the Earth on Monday than at any other time since 2005, has retreated from a glacial period that would have covered large areas in white before the thaw about 370,000 years ago, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science. The research was conducted using an instrument on board the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that allowed an unprecedented examination of “the most recent Martian ice age recorded in the planet’s north polar ice cap,” according to a NASA press release. https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/31/mars-also-undergoing-climate-change-ice-age-retrea/",UCBGSh3kifneGqsNbix6qptg,1,UgxpBjinAgmcw3r-5iF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Off the top of my head I can think of all kinds of different reasons why someone might not respond, ""not being very concerned"" being only one of them. With the Cook study they studied published paper abstracts so response from the authors wasn't necessary - out of the papers that expressed a position on AGW 97% endorsed the view that AGW is happening. The many other ""consensus"" studies over the years have ALL shown similarly high rates of consensus, ranging from the mid-80's to high 90's. To my knowledge there have been no comparable studies from the other side showing these consensus figures to be incorrect. CO2 might be ""plant food"" but this doesn't mean it is ""harmless"" or the ""least of our concerns"".

People not stating a positive position on a view in their published papers doesn't mean that they endorse the negative view?

When you hear that, you can be sure the speaker is a political activist, and not a true scientist. For example, the father of modern AGW theory (warming due to CO2) has been arrested multiple times. He chained himself to the White House fence, and blocked the entrance to coal mines in West Virginia (one day drive from D.C. or NYC). His global climate model has failed to predict mean global temperature rise for more than 30 years now, so they keep adding fudge factors to make the model reproduce past temperatures. Warming through atmospheric CO2 was first proposed by Tyndall, based on lab experiments. The experiments were flawed, and he was proved wrong by his peers. Who says otherwise? Right, not scientists, but political activists. But let’s not be too hard on Tyndall, since the field of Thermodynamics had not yet developed. Next came Svante Arrhenius, who did not research the matter, but thought perhaps CO2 might impact climate. He thought it might improve the environment (warmer temps & more CO2 are good for plants). Arrhenius was refuted exhaustively by Wood before 1909, and the theory had been completely abandoned by 1950, according to the American Meteorological Society. https://principia-scientific.org/global-warming-alarm-is-built-on-200-year-old-discredited-science/ Feel free to ask questions, if you’re still not convinced you’ve been lied to since elementary school.",UCOFTy9MED2OJ5Wk6PX_HSvw,1,UgxpBjinAgmcw3r-5iF4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

They use fudged (forged) data and make incorrect conclusions. They are not repeatable but no one ever calls them on it. My point is that the academic-industrial complex is funded by government grant money. Academia is funded and relies on government grant money and will do whatever it takes to get it. When given a grant by the government to study climate change, the results had better be in favor of more government control of the economy in pursuit of controlling this alleged manmade climate crisis or guess what?

They say: we mesured this using this technique, we gathered that much data in that much time using this sampling method. Then we concluded this (and possibly we propose a new model that improves some other ones). Science is not a religion, it's about honesty. Saying what they did, how they did, and why they concluded what they concluded. The problem is when this precise information is diluted, simplified and distorted. That's why uneducated people can loose faith in science, but it's a ridiculous shortcut. Because they don't know what science is.

The question asked in the survey was whether climate change is happening and whether human activity is the cause.

I will post my response here. I agree that our weather / climate are incredibly complex systems, large numbers of variable inputs with random / chaotic interactions between them, which is why weather forecasts are difficult. What we can do however is combine our understanding of physics (""settled science""), make measurements and observe the longer term trends. From observation it appears that we have increased CO2 concentrations from a maximum of 300ppm (over the past million years) to now over 400ppm in a very short space of time. We can also observe that global temperatures have indeed risen, broadly in line with the climate models. ""we don't really know that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration is a bad thing."" There appears to be plenty of reasons why scientists believe that a warmer planet will overall be a bad thing. Predictions that warming will lead to increased extreme weather events (droughts, floods, fires, storms etc) now appear to be happening before our eyes. Do you have any evidence / proof that this change won't harmful? Any change generally creates risk, the more major the change the higher the risk. As CO2 levels continue to increase, the changes and associated risk will inevitably increase. Are you part of the fossil fuel industry?

Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it.<br /><br />If that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support.<br /><br />But that is not what the human species wants to do, it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with population control, it doesn&#39;t have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. <br /><br /> Physics law two)<br /><br />It is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving. No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind.<br />Now you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that&#39;s moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don&#39;t have endless space then you are going to come unstuck.<br /><br />This should tell you, it doesn&#39;t matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing.<br /><br /> The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer.<br /><br />The answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. <br /><br /> So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support, then you don&#39;t have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. <br /><br />These two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it is not a good one .<br /><br />If anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong, get a limited space like a cup, then show me how you can endlessly pour water into it without it ever overflowing. Without trickery , And I will admit I am wrong.<br /><br />I will not be losing any sleep, because to do so you will have to break the laws of physics.",UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g,0,UgxW4b8woBjOkXA8pjx4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

It was likely related to warming elsewhere while some other regions were colder, such as the tropical Pacific. Average global mean temperatures have been calculated to be similar to early-mid-20th-century warming. Possible causes of the Medieval Warm Period include increased solar activity, decreased volcanic activity, and changes to ocean circulation. The period was followed by a cooler period in the North Atlantic and elsewhere termed the Little Ice Age. Some refer to the event as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly as this term emphasizes that climatic effects other than temperature were important.

Pay attention to Tables 2 &amp; 3 and Page 6 and do the math for yourselves!<br /><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf"">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf</a>",UCvIoqHAPckj64blYQTo13dQ,0,UgxWW0Q8AbqV7y4X5Zx4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

So if you take 5% of 0.04% you get very very little man made co2 in the atmosphere. I equate this to like pissing in the ocean.

I know many people that prefer cooking with gas over electricity because of the rapid change in temp that you can control with gas. All the green energy in CA makes electricity also very expensive.

The science on manmade climate change is FAR from settled! There is NO concensus of 97% of climate scientists. (That was based on flawed data but you can look that up for yourself) This is what some of the scientists who have worked at the IPCC ,past and present. had to say.

It is a POLITICAL body. It is NOT a scientific body. How have past dire predictions of climate alarmists fared? Climate Alarmists Have Been Wrong About Virtually Everything https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/22289-climate-alarmists-have-been-wrong-about-virtually-everything Climate Alarm: Failed Prognostications https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/climate-change/climate-alarm-failed-prognostications/ But the best reason for being skeptical about the IPCC climate change predictions is simply to consider the source of the predictions: Computer Models of the climate Computer models are only as good as the program that is written for them, what data is nput and how well these reflect the real world reality. Predictions resulting from computer modeling can not be considered to be scientific fact. The more accurately the model reflects reality, the higher the probability that the prediction will come to pass. Useful Computer Modeling of the entire climate of earth is still in its infancy. It uses only a few variables that cannot possibly include or accurately reflect all that goes into making up our climate which itself is fluid and ever -changing. Climate is the result of complex sets of interactions of physical systems , each with their own sets of variables that can range from a few in number to thousands to millions depending on how far you want to break them down. Breaking them down is limited only by the level of our knowledge, which is presently at the quantum level of interactions. The systems forming our climate are not limited to earth systems but range through space to the sun. Science does yet fully understand the formation of our climate. Suffice it to say that our computer modeling is as of yet , far too simplistic to accurately reflect our climate making most of the meaningful or accurate predictions for such a complex set of interactions nearly impossible",UC3PdcJOswNV_zKcwge7-Xfg,1,UgycMuF3FYEit8q1HjZ4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

But never has it changed at such a fast rate as it has now. Hence the classic ""hockey stick"" graph shape that has been recreated with different data again again. That is where the concern lies. Our temperature shouldn't have 50,000 years worth of normal fluctuation happen in 50 years. ""Climate depends on solar activity"" -- This was actually a huge hypothesis in the inception of this climate problem in the late 20th century. And even recent studies show that solar output has increased within this last century. But the sun's output also stopped increasing late in the century and the heating trend still continues. It's possible the increase helped raise temperatures, but it did not account for the entirety of the raise, especially in the later portion of time where the sun did not continue to heat up yet earths temperature still did. "", planetary motion"" -- This doesn't really affect the climate. Not sure how it could given that our orbit is nearly perfectly circular and the periapsis and apoapsis of our orbit are reached multiple times per year so any difference between them would not accumulate. "" and the precession of the earth's axis of rotation"" -- That's how seasons happen. The rate of our procession is not changing. How would this warm the earth on a global scale? "" as well as underwater volcanic activity, among other things. "" Volcanic activity only amounts for up to half a gigaton of co2 a year for particularly active years (down to .12GT for less). Human cars alone emit more than 3 gigatons/yr. Volcanoes do contribute a lot, but historically without humans, this gets balanced out by other factors like ocean absorption (and subsequent conversion to seashells in cooler waters). It's the human element that introduces a disruption to the natural slow ebb and flow of this greenhouse accumulation and that's what tips the scales into warming trend.",UCcCMXsqw5RyHbbsLCnAnG-g,1,UgyXcCNhnBvCfQCHGsN4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I don&#39;t blame them for being cowards. After all fair and well moderated debates would expose their lies, distortions, reliance on media to smear their opponents, their laughable predictions of Climate Armageddon events that never came to pass, their computer models that only proved the old adage &quot;garbage in garbage out&quot;, their former promotion of &quot;Global Cooling&quot; and a soon coming Ice Age they were flogging in the 1970&#39;s supposedly CAUSED IN LARGE PART BY BAD BAD HUMANS BURNING FOSSIL FUELS, LMAO. Then just a few short years later and in obedience to their political masters and paymasters some of these same &quot;scientists&quot; who were pushing Global Cooling began flogging &quot;Global Warming!&quot; Again like Global Cooling the natural warming cycle was allegedly caused by burning fossil fuels. LOL And &quot;honest&quot; Jean Chretien our &quot;dear leader&quot; and climate saviour, set the example for what treatment dissenters could expect to face, when he had 3 Environment Canada Climate scientists fired for contradicting his govt&#39;s Global Warming scaremongering by publicly stating that the warming of the 1990&#39;s was simply another natural weather cycle.  <br />  <br /> These cowardly scientific propagandists also duck debate because they have been caught numerous times manipulating weather records and data from the past to make hot periods like the dirty 30&#39;s appear to be cooler than they actually were. They have also been caught flagrantly cherry picking data from weather stations that show warming or stable temperatures while not using the data from those that showed cooling in order to falsely claim that recent decades are the hottest in thousands of years. 10 hours of debate would not be enough time to expose all of their manipulations of the evidence and false claims. Speaking of which, they also wouldn&#39;t dare debate the ClimateGate scandal and the resulting whitewash investigation, etc.  <br />  <br /> Why risk debate when the resulting humiliating defeat would collapse the decades long propaganda campaign and school indoctrination and destroy the little credibility that our politicians and their &quot;kept&quot; scientists and other elitists such as Judges have left? Like all dictators and corrupt regimes the Globalist cabal pushing Climate alarmism never want to get on the same stage as educated and well informed opponents. Its easier to indoctrinate the majority of people who have been dumbed down and indoctrinated by our miseducation system and the govt&#39;s co-conspirators in media who will regurgitate any propaganda the gov&#39;t wishes them to and obediently will do a hit job smear on any prominent scientist or intellectual who dares go against the fake 97% Climate Armageddon consensus. But more people are paying attention as they suffer financial difficulties from Carbon Taxes and are studying the counter evidence. The tipping point is approaching and the tar and feathers are being prepared. ;)",UCWcbDcbfA78V19iaf2Yvi_A,0,UgwIeB6bYk6jMNSREv54AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

For example, Naomi Oreskes found no rejections of the consensus in a survey of 928 abstracts performed in 2004. Doran &amp; Zimmerman (2009) found a 97% consensus among scientists actively publishing climate research. Anderegg et al. (2010) reviewed publicly signed declarations supporting or rejecting human-caused global warming, and again found over 97% consensus among climate experts. Cook et al. (2013) found the same 97% result through a survey of over 12,000 climate abstracts from peer-reviewed journals, as well as from over 2,000 scientist author self-ratings, among abstracts and papers taking a position on the causes of global warming.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Critics of our paper have pointed to a blog post that asked 7 scientists to rate their own papers. We&#39;d already done that, except rather than cherry pick a handful of scientists known to hold contrarian views, we blanket emailed over 8,500 scientists. This resulted in 1,200 scientists rating the level of endorsement of their own climate papers, with 2,142 papers receiving a self-rating.<br /><br />While our analysis of abstracts found 97.1% consensus among abstracts stating a position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), the method of self-rating complete papers independently found 97.2% consensus among papers self-rated as stating a position on AGW. This independent confirmation demonstrates how robust the scientific consensus is. Whether it&#39;s Naomi Oreskes&#39; original analysis of climate research in 2004, Doran and Kendall-Zimmerman (2009) surveying the community of Earth scientists, Anderegg et al. (2010) analysing public declarations on climate change, or our own independent methods, the overwhelming consensus consistently appears.&quot;<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.iflscience.com/environment/atmosphere-scientist-slams-climate-change-deniers-in-brilliant-viral-post/"">https://www.iflscience.com/environment/atmosphere-scientist-slams-climate-change-deniers-in-brilliant-viral-post/</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/25/heres-what-happens-when-you-try-to-replicate-climate-contrarian-papers?fbclid=IwAR2ffeNNPuooiab-MhFy0EfvwYiZb6MRKbOMcV20s1xytqyK29RAuHL-h5o"">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/25/heres-what-happens-when-you-try-to-replicate-climate-contrarian-papers?fbclid=IwAR2ffeNNPuooiab-MhFy0EfvwYiZb6MRKbOMcV20s1xytqyK29RAuHL-h5o</a><br /><br />When the papers in the 3% of papers denying AGW were looked at and their findings attempted to be replicated:<br /><br />&quot;Cherry picking was the most common characteristic they shared. We found that many contrarian research papers omitted important contextual information or ignored key data that did not fit the research conclusions.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;When we tried to reproduce their model of the lunar and solar influence on the climate, we found that the model only simulated their temperature data reasonably accurately for the 4,000-year period they considered. However, for the 6,000 years’ worth of earlier data they threw out, their model couldn’t reproduce the temperature changes. The authors argued that their model could be used to forecast future climate changes, but there’s no reason to trust a model forecast if it can’t accurately reproduce the past.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You may have noticed another characteristic of contrarian climate research – there is no cohesive, consistent alternative theory to human-caused global warming. Some blame global warming on the sun, others on orbital cycles of other planets, others on ocean cycles, and so on. There is a 97% expert consensus on a cohesive theory that’s overwhelmingly supported by the scientific evidence, but the 2–3% of papers that reject that consensus are all over the map, even contradicting each other. The one thing they seem to have in common is methodological flaws like cherry picking, curve fitting, ignoring inconvenient data, and disregarding known physics.&quot;<br /><br />I note this video provides one survey of meteorologists from like 15 years ago where 48% &quot;answered no or I don&#39;t know&quot;, and that was specifically in relation to warming that had happened. 15 years on we are now clearly seeing the empirical evidence of the predicted warming.

Let's say physics doesn't exist even Einstein's theory of relativity is rubbish. You can't get away from reality. Which shows you, you cannot have endless growth in a space that is not endless, Regardless of the size of the limited space you will not be able to endlessly put something into it. The result will always be the same result overflowing or overpopulation. You prove it to yourself every single day of your life. Think about it. From when you're making yourself a drink you recognise the limited space of that cup, your fuel tank of your car, the boot of your car, a shopping trolley, putting people in your car and any other vehicle or building you come across. You cannot have endless growth in a space that is not endless, you can deny everything you like, but you cannot deny what you practice and witness and experience every single day of your life, that shows you, you cannot have endless growth in a space that is not endless. If physics doesn't exist then I challenge anyone to get a cup, and try and endlessly pour water into that cup, you will fail , try the same thing with your fuel tank, you will fail again, with the boot of your car, you will fail, with a shopping trolley you will fail. Try and put an endless amount of people into your car or any other vehicle or building you come across, you will fail every single time. So why do you think you can have endless growth on a planet, if you failed to endlessly put people / items into all the limited spaces you come across in your daily life, then there is no logical reason why you will not fail in trying to put an endless amount of people onto this planet because they all share the same problem they are not endless spaces.

Specially when it claim to be an intelligent spaces. When it claims that the health and safety of its offsprings is paramount to it, that it cares about it's environment. you cared about each other. The human race is full of it up to it bloody neck. I'm just having a ball. I love upsetting people, I love listening and reading their sarcasm. I love throwing it back at them as well. The human race deserves everything it gets from me and its environment. If it doesn't like what I say about it then change the way it behaves and become an intelligent species. Put the health and safety of it's offspring first. physically cared about your environment and each other.

So, my point is, that humans are the only intellectual, creative, passionate (you and add a million characteristics that show we are very different from other forms of life on this planet) species on this planet. Why don't we use these superior powers to save this world rather than destroy it. Destructive element in humans comes from excess greed and personal gratification. If we can control this excessiveness in our make up through humility and spiritual awareness of who we actually are we can control our selfish urges in all spheres of our existence. We can have a population that fits the correct balance of limited resources. We can be creative to explore other planets and use the resources there rather than destroy our living planet. Its limitless what we humans can achieve if we are keep a lid on our selfish greed and desires that put us in equality with the lower intellectual species of this planet. If we leave it to wars, viruses and natural disasters to reduce our population then we will survive that and continue with our destruction. We have to change from within you and me and every one. We have to appreciate what we have on this planet and respect it and use them sparingly (want not waste not - attitude). There is so much that we still need to learn about ourselves and our education system does nothing to address human greed and self gratification. This is because we have not understood that our bodies are not just material living things that need to be constantly gratified and entertained. We are also spiritual and a we do need to learn to get in touch with our spirit and spirit of all living creatures on this planet and the our creator who blew His spirit into our bodies the day were born. Life didn't just happen it was caused to happen by a deep deep act of love of sharing His spirit with ours. Sorry, I made this long statement but there is a lot we have to learn about ourselves and we can start now. Lets go and start with teaching our children the things they need to learn about truly about themselves and who they really are. None of this evolutionary nonsense in the name of science.

For it is no good understanding something if you haven't the ability to act upon what you understand, That's how you become infested with problems. What is the human race infested with problems, because though it understands where it lives which is on a planet, it knows the planet is a limited space because it can measure it, if it was endless space then it couldn't be measured. But it has no ability to act upon that understanding and the proof of that it in the fact it has based its policies on endless growth in people living on a planet, a limited space. so I get extremely annoyed with people who comment to me trying to pass themselves off as intelligent people. so I get great enjoyment out of showing them they are not, and yes I love making them look small and stupid.

Two basic laws of physics I'd like to introduce you to. 1) it is physically impossible to endlessly put something into something that is not endless. but that's what the human race wants to do, isn't it! to endlessly multiply into a space that is not endless. You practice this simple law every single day of your life, you recognise every limited space and you understand you cannot endlessly put something into them, like a cup a vehicle or building except for the thing you rely on for your existence your planet. Why is that? 2) It is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that keeps moving. it doesn't mattter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind. You could keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that is moving but to do so you will need endless space otherwise you're going to come unstuck. You don't have endless space do you? so that should tell you that it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because you have a population that keeps growing and the quicker it grows the quicker your housing problem will come back. so building homes is not the answer is it, it is controlling the population. that's the same with food supply the more people the more food but you don't have endless space to keep building homes and growing the food they need,. That's why the UK is solely relying on them massive lorries to come into the country with all that food because we are vastly overcrowded. More proof: In the Second World War the Germans targeted the food supply ships. to do what? to starve us into surrendering. if we weren't overcrowded they couldn't do that could they? it is why the government of the day told the people to dig up there flower beds and plant vegetables, it is why food rationing came about, because there's too manny people in this country for this country to naturally support and that was in the Second World War. and rationing lasted until 1954 that's 14 years after the Second World War had finished, it took 14 years to build up the food supply from outside sources, so this country could function normally. so imagine today. the truth is the UK was overpopulated before World War one.",UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g,1,UgysY3a8IqznFRB41Tx4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Natural ecosystems are dynamic you moron. They are in a constant state of flux and rebalancing at all time points, in all places and under all conditions you simpleton. That is why 98% of all species that have ever existed are gone and gone long before we got here. It is why, if you clear an acre of rain forest then leave it alone it will go through a process and pretty much recreate what was there. It is also why if you introduce and invasive species to a new environment it might thrive and multiply or it might die. Your view of the natural kingdom is idiotic and romantic, too. Animals exercise no controls over themselves unlike humans. Unrestrained, predators will eat all the prey until they are extinct and then become extinct themselves. If confined to a small space they will not create a sewer system and will pollute the land, too. The fact they cannot make an SUV matters not. All animals capable of building shelters for themselves will do so regardless of the consequences to other things. They will kill trees, if necessary to make a home for themselves. They have no self-limiting properties or propensities. They will overrun any environment if possible. Your second law of physics is no such thing and a ridiculous analogy. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion and objects at rest tend to stay at rest barring outside forces. So what? If you want to say problems need to be solved, fine, but your water in the cup is ridiculous. Human populations tend to be self limiting with prosperity. All prosperous countries experience rapidly declining birth rates. So, if you want to limit population then you must find ways to help countries prosper.

The human female has been given a wonderful gift which is to create life. and she has done nothing else but abuse that gift for own personal gain, to trap a man or to live off. it is why we have the benefit culture with up to 8 generation born on benefits. recent we have a woman on the TV in the UK with 26 children and once more, a single woman as increase the country's population by 24 people. this is physical evidence that shows women are not responsible enough to handle this gift they have been given. so it should be turned over to society to decide when a child is born not a woman on her own. because she's proven she cannot handle this responsibility. so to reduce the human population you just bring in a law that stops the human female having children when every she feels like it. so it starts with a woman can only produce a single child in a lifetime until further notice and that will be between the ages of 20 and 35 no sooner no later. she has to prove to society that she has a proper home to bring her child into, and she is willing to be a full-time mother to that child that she freely chooses to bring into the world. and she has the finance to look after that child i.e.: living with a man who is in full-time work. She will have a contract at the at the age of 20. before she can get pregnant the man she is inviting into have sex with her will have to sign that contract giving her permission to use his sperm to fertilise her egg so she can have a child. But before that man can sign that contract he must be in full-time work and they must be living together for a minimum of three years. And once he signs that contract he is obliged by law to financially look after that woman and her child. that will rid society of Jack the lads. that will eradicate child poverty by eradicating the benefit culture which women create, it will also eradicate over 90% of your crime. that simple law protecting the welfare of children. would solve a lot of problems it will also slowly reduce the human population. achieved by putting the health and safety of our children first. which at the moment the only thing that is paramount is this selfish wants of our females.",UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g,1,UgysY3a8IqznFRB41Tx4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Is climate change real or false? forget all the scientists and there graphs and figures, just deal with basic physics. The answer lies in two simple laws of physics. Physic law one) It is physically impossible to endlessly put something into something that is not endless. Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it. If that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support. But that is not what the human species wants to do, it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with population control, it doesn't have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. Physics law two) It is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving. No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind. Now you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that's moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don't have endless space then you are going to come unstuck. This should tell you, it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing. The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer. The answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support, then you don't have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. These two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it is not a good one . If anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong, get a limited space like a cup, then show me how you can endlessly pour water into it without it ever overflowing. Without trickery , And I will admit I am wrong.

BUT it only needs to hit 1 to be reflected back to earth. The green house effect would still happen with glass only a few microns thick. Volcanoes cool the atmosphere due to particulates that reflect sunlight (like dust particles; they have a greater effect than the CO2), since man puts out more than 10 billion tons of CO2 every year, no volcano even comes close. There are no 30 year cycles; the solar cycle 11 years, and all of the other natural climate cycles are thousands of years; 100,000 years for the ice age cycle. Those short-term warming/cooling events of the last few millennia were hemispheric, not global. There are 2,000 international climate scientists that work on the IPCC reports, and the U.S. is the only country in the world that will not be in the Paris Accord.

There are 30 year cycles, which is borne out by all the temperature records. It was warm in the 30s, 60s and 90s. It will be warm again in the 20s. And it was cold in the 40s, 70s, 2000s and will be cold again in the 2030s. And if there is evidence that isn't all politically motivated lies again, where is the evidence that human activity has anything to do with it? Please don't tell me you believe that harmelss CO2 - a trace element in the atmosphere, is causing ""global warming""? That has been debunked and ridiculed six ways to Sunday. A single volcanic eruption produces more CO2 than all the human activity, hell all the animal activity, period in recorded history.

Basically very little. The world isn't going to stop burning oil and coal because some poor countries are going to be devastated and suffer massive famine waves.

So heh, I don't personally know what can be done. The push towards solar and wind is a good start, but impossible to scale with the ressources available. Nuclear is a perfect solution, except for the public's distrust of it. Maybe fusion, but that's theoretical still. And all that on the premise that we all get electric cars and all the massive worldwide fleet of vehicle switches to electric? I don't conceive of any short time span where that would be possible, so again, heh. On the personal level, use your car less, walk or take public transit. Consume less stuff in general, don't buy one use things, and try to not over-consume uselessly. Food wise, try to eat locally, but don't sacrifice your health for any reason whatsoever. Don't listen to the vegans too; if your meat is sourced locally, odds are it's less polluting than the pound of imported soy from Brazil.

So here's the quick version. One of the by products of industrialisation was the combustion of massive amounts of organic compounds, like coals, oils and the likes. These have released greenhouse gases, and the atmosphere's content have changed slightly, pushing the equilibrium temperature towards the hotter end of the spectrum. The climate is now warming up slowly but surely, and with that comes a lot of potential issues, because the rest of the planetary system's haven't had the time to find new equilibrium's of their own. So basically, shit's going wack. The ironic part is that the climate will be a lot wackier before it gets hotter, so expect extreme's, like drought's or floods, freezing or heat waves, snow where there never was or no snow where there should be, etc etc etc. Equilibrium is broken, and it's going to be like that for a while. Now there's going to be a huuuuuge amount of consequence's to that; loss of biodiversity, acidification of the oceans, mass immigration, rise in insects count and potential pandemics and the likes. Thing is though, these will be gradual, and as scary as they sounds, they are all inevitable at this point, and will happen so slowly, that very little to no one will actively notice them. We'll find solutions as we have always done, not that they will be individually pleasant solutions, but humans in general will be fine. Of course, poorer countries will serve as the benchmark for what the rest of the world will have to go through, but life is full of injustices. Now comes the annoying part. These climate activist are basically doing a huge service and disservice to the problem at hand. In a sense, it's the same for breast cancer, which gets like 10 times the funding of the rest of the cancers, but is way less deadly than any of the more prevalent ones; as long as it educates people and get's money towards cancer research, no scientist will say anything about it. The cost is that we ought to allow some people to gain a sense of moral superiority because it relates to women and stuff. All in all, these political/climate activist are bringing a lot of attention to it, and we kind of need that. Of course, they clamor that the science show's the end of the world is nigh, while the science doesn't say anything of the sort. You should usually take what an activist say's with a grain of salt, unless they have an actual background on the topic they are talking about, and even then, social ""sciences"" are more or less a parody of intellectuals at this point, so heh. Natural sciences tends to be rigorous in it's premise, so you can usually trust them in their conclusions. And the x year till the end of world probably stems from potential runaway effect global warming could bring, which would produce a positive feedback loop to god knows what new average temperature. Again, not the end of world. Simply a potentially hazardous cyclical system with really huge emissions that'll feed the ungoing imbalance.",UCzuS-cSqsZ3mD2ms7oEYhFw,1,UgxqpqBXvSXYCEnqVdl4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

See, thing is, if you look at the whole ordeal, and this exchange, I mean, you have done more logical fallacies than I can count. It's getting embarrassing... I mean, try for some consistency at least? You asked questions only using the abstract, and misquoted it. I corrected you with it. I haven't answered anything with it unless it was a well rounded answer, which is rarely the case, being an abstract and all. But you already know what an abstract is ;) Now until now, you havent demonstrated in any way shape or form any intellectual honesty. And you want to know what's the smoking gun um? I was keeping that one on the side, just for this occasion. Here's a quote from the article : ""This letter was conceived as a 'citizen science' project by volunteers contributing to the Skeptical Science website (www.skepticalscience.com). "" There would have been so much you could have done with this! You could have discredited the article has a biased classification done by volunteers picked from a uniform pool! It would have been incredible! I'd have been stunned by a statement like that! But no, sadly, you never read the article you quoted so vividly, and tried to fool me into thinking I was speaking to someone worth my time. Heh. Happens I guess. I don't need to do any efforts to be pompous when I am discussing with someone showing that low level of interest on the topic while also attempting to pass a vague and fake intellectual curiosity has genuine. My job isn't to spoon feed you anything! It's actually to code satellite simulations, but that's another topic altogether. And as long as you don't bother reading the articles on your own, and you don't form your own opinions, i'll continue referring to you as a silly lad, same as an innocent child proclaiming his skills at a task, only to fail it seconds later, and try to pass it off as a success. But don't worry, let the experts deal with experts stuff, and go play with the flat earthers. They also constantly ask for proof and don't read it afterward.",UCzuS-cSqsZ3mD2ms7oEYhFw,1,UgxqpqBXvSXYCEnqVdl4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Allow me to school you on this. You obviously know squat about what those articles are about, or mean. So heres how it goes. An article about climate change doesn't need to take a stance on it. Exploration of a phenomenon relating closely or not to it will get it flagged as a ""Climate change paper"" by these studies. Now, to discriminate among papers that are not useful to the statistic being done, of course they would remove these papers. An article about the impact of hotter water on phytoplanctons isn't relevant to the question of is it manmade or not, nor is an article about rock formations containing more or less carbons if the atmosphere's content get changed. The fact of the matter remains the same. All the studies I linked showed a big agreement among scientists regarding whether or not it is manmade. Here's your point by point answering thingy. Quite clean, I got to say. 1. It's a census of census. The point is to centralise all the articles that did polls in a place. The more there is, the less likely there is some fluke scientist lying or something. 2. You obviously didn't read past the abstract, because that is in the abstract. You can't lie to me you silly! 3. I understand it's hard to read these things, they ain't written to be pleasant, but you'd think this sentence would have struck you a bit more, being the literal first one of the abstract : ""We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'."" Please refer to the paragraph above for what it means. 4. Nah, it's not because of a hiatus, it's because fools like, well, you, claim that because winter is cold and there's a blizzard that there's no warming happening. Climate change also is a more proper way to call it, as some places will get colder, and others hotter. As for the N=2412 papers, it means that out of all the papers they used in their survey, they sent questions to the authors, and not all of them wrote back! A total of 2412 answered, and their answer matched the 97%. Now of course, one could claim poisson noise on this dataset and take off a bit of it's weight, but that would mean disregarding the rest of the article based on a weaker argument, which you've never done right? And bloody hell, you can't take a quote like that and literally ignore the next sentence! Shame really! Here's the full quote : ""A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science."" Now, lecturing aside, there's only so much schooling that I care to do. If your next retort is intellectually dishonest or lazy, I might not put any effort in the answer, because you know, when monday comes, i'll go back to my office to work on my research, and you'll go back to whatever you do. I like to poke the hornets nest sometimes and get a good giggle out of it, but this is getting rather depressing.

Says it all for me really. His video is a diatribe of confusing nonsense that just seeks to sow seeds of doubt (as per Naomi Oreskes brilliant book Merchants of Doubt) when there actually is near-total consensus of climate scientists that global warming is largely man-induced. I checked out <a href=""http://skepticalscience.org/"">skepticalscience.org</a>. on this topic. They make more sense to me than this guy. I have also read extensively on climate change books by people who actually know about the topic - ie climate scientists (Gergis, Hansen etc). Robson, who wants us to believe a small number of neigh-sayers instead of such learned experienced people, is seemingly just trying to prop up the greedy establishment that wants to continue poisoning our atmosphere. In one of his newsletters I note he is peddling the right-wing myth that the Australian 2019-20 fire emergency was brought about by large forest floor loads ha ha when all the Aussie bushfire experts say that is nonsense, and is just lazy political rhetoric. That unprecedented fire emergency that roared through forests and pastures alike like a dragon (even climbing up vertical cliff faces) was predicted by climate experts long ago, to be a result of a hotter, drier climate, and they have been vindicated in no uncertain terms. However Robson seems to think he is better than the experts with all their qualifications, research and experience. Does he think all the world&#39;s temperature gauges are faulty? Does he know anything about carbon isotopes that prove that most of the carbon in the atmosphere derives from fossil fuels? Be aware, it&#39;s all staring at us in the face!

They also don't pollute like the made on the cheap Russian RBMK reactors. As for Fukushima, though it was placed in a stupid area, the accident has yet to confirm a single death from radiation. These materials- bar Pu238, occur naturally- not necessarily in the isotopes used, like U235, but Uranium is a natural material from this planet, just like Hydrogen- though H2 & H3 (Deuterium and Tritium) used alongside Pu238 or U235 in fusion bombs- fission boosted fusion bombs- are processed, but they still occur in small amounts naturally. If you want clean energy, then nuclear power is the best option. We've moved on from the early reactors and are now moving towards fourth generation reactors with zero chance of a Chernobyl type event.

Energy companies making vast profits, governments increasing taxes All the name of going green. That's the lie and the reason! If we really want to go green, then we need to help the 3rd world to develop, not hinder! Development leads to freedom, as a result, people have less children. Less mouths to feed, less resources ect. Oh and eventually go nuclear. There's an old/ new nuclear technology that is far less harmful than current plants. Can't remember the name!

You can change the location, date, range, etc, and compare raw data yourself from locations all over the country. As long as you're out of the city (hell, often in the city is fine too) the temperature numbers *do not add up* to the nonsense they've been pedaling. It's not even warming up. Look at temp graphs from geological time frames, Younger Dryas to present, we've been on a cooling trend for nearly 10,000 years. These tiny little bumps where it's warm are the actual outliers. If CO2 *can* actually warm our planet it might be a good idea to pump the atmosphere full of it as the geological record shows we're coming up on another ice age.

The likely reason for the increase was the fact the station is now surrounded by development and pavement.

Nobody on this film said anything important and the proof is that no one has told the public that 1). for every gallon of diesel fuel burned ten thousand gallons of air is used to burn it. (you can roughly calculate the VAST quantity of air, millions of cubic miles) that is now our atmosphere. 2). Every gallon of diesel burned throws16 pounds of CO2 into our atmosphere. ). 3). The Arctic recorded wildly warm temperatures of 94 degrees this summer. There is another fraud committed by this film. It is true the earth goes through heating and cooling cycles as previous ice ages have shown but those take tens of thousands of years, but the temperature of earth has warmed faster in the last 50 years than it ever has in millions of years. The last time the CO2 level was this high was during the Pliocene era 3 million years ago and we are accelerating that level at an astonishing rate. We do not have the technology to remove CO2 from such a mind boggling quantity of our atmosphere. I am a scientist and I work for big oil and the favorite trick is when they are backed in the corner they attack the messenger which was Al Gore. They roundly criticize him for flying in a jet, instead of what, walking around, or taking a bus? I do not get paid to give out this info I just gave you. The amount of money given by oil companies to create films and buy television time is HUGE. The amount given to inform the public is tiny. If Al Gore did not buck up for his film no one would have done it. As a scientist I am appalled that the public has been convinced there is some type of conspiracy to convince every one there is a conspiracy to promote human caused global warming. I will only say this is an absolutely solid gold tribute to corporate propaganda techniques because all, every single one, of my scientist friends knows whats going on in America and I am astounded that anybody would believe Exxon after they ripped off all of the employees and retirement funds.

Australia has an Emission Reduction Fund which replaced the unpopular carbon tax. So that blows your false statement out the water. America also has no carbon tax but has shown the highest decrease in CO2 emissions than any country in the world. So that kills off your false statement. You are just regurgitating propaganda. Here are the facts and I quote: Here is America's performance compared to the rest of the world. ""Global emissions rose by 21% to 6.04 billion metric tons over the 12 years, mostly due to booming economic growth in India and China, where coal-fired energy output continues to expand. The truth, and it's proven by the hard data, is that CO2 made in the USA will not choke the world to death or cause it to massively overheat. And you can thank capitalism for that. Because capitalism, unlike socialism and its welfare-state kin, hates waste. So it does all it can to be efficient. That means using as little energy as possible to make things. And this predates any of the current CO2 hysteria. In the U.S., the data are clear and utterly convincing: In 1949, it took 1,098 metric tons of CO2 emissions to produce $1 million in GDP in the U.S., after adjusting for inflation. Today, it takes just 301 metric tons to produce that same million dollars, after inflation — a 73% gain in carbon-efficiency. Indeed, we're actually decarbonizing our economy, and rapidly. As new technologies continue to emerge, including better battery storage for alternative energy sources, safer nuclear power plants, and the fracking revolution that continues to make natural gas the energy of choice for conventional power plants, U.S. CO2 output is likely to continue to decline for every dollar of GDP produced. Instead of being harshly criticized by green groups and Euro-socialists, as has been the case for three decades now, we should be the model for green growth. When it comes to CO2, the U.S. is the leader. The rest of the world is the laggard. That's a fact"".",UCXQmMuM6mYHNXVR0xMvgKtg,1,UgyfPXDkhomfblJZy6p4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

We stopped spending the whole day looking for food LONG before the industrial revolution and mass burning of fossil fuels. The extreme steps forward humanity has made is NOT because of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, sure, but we already have plenty of other energy sources that we could be using (and always have). I would say our steps forward have a lot more to do scientific advancement, and this same scientific advancement could now be applied to finding new, cleaner energy sources. The first ""fusion oven"" is apparently almost within reach. If we could figure out how to harness this energy source (the same process that occurs within the sun) it would likely solve our energy problems forever. It's only a matter of funding the research properly and I'm sure we would crack it within a relatively short space of time. The main things standing in our way are complacency and rich, powerful vested interests who don't want to lose their gravy train - namely the oil lobby, who are the financiers of the above video (Rockefellers - google ""Climate Nexus"").

We have the biased BBC and it`s dangerous agenda in the UK which shuts down anyone who wants to debate the subject of climate change. Copied from GWPF: The BBC program presented by Sir David Attenborough went far beyond its remit to present the facts of climate change, instead broadcasting a highly politicised manifesto in favour of renewable energy and unjustified alarm. The program highlighted suggestions that storms, floods, heatwaves and sea level rise are all rapidly getting worse as a result of climate change. However, the best available data, published in the last few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA, contradicts the BBC’s alarmist exaggeration of empirical evidence. In its 5th Assessment Report (2013), the IPCC concluded: “Current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century … No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.” In its more recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, published in 2018, these findings were reconfirmed. It stated that “Numerous studies towards and beyond AR5 have reported a decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and/or the globally accumulated cyclonic energy… There is consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trends in the global number of very intense cyclones.” Regarding floods, the IPCC’s Special Report concluded: “There is low confidence due to limited evidence, however, that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and the magnitude of floods. “ There is also no observational evidence that the rate of sea level rise is getting worse. NASA satellite data shows that since 1993, there has been an annual mean sea level rise of 3.3mm, with no significant level of acceleration in the last three decades. Suggestions by David Attenborough and Michael Mann that climate change is causing increases in wildfires in the US and globally are also misleading and not supported by any empirical evidence. According to a survey published by the Royal Society the global area burned has actually declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago. These are vitally important facts that should have been mentioned if an accurate description of the impact of climate change on wildfires was to be maintained. In his letter of complaint, Dr Benny Peiser, the GWPF’s director, has asked the BBC to acknowledge and correct the evident errors and misleading suggestions documented in the complaint and offer remedial measures as soon as possible.",UCJ3jESvK_70-mkHDx5tFDgg,1,UgxdWQBWep4jeAVJswd4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

We simply tipped the balance a bit towards the climate being hotter. The Earth was somewhat stable before we started burning a lot of carbon-rich ressources, and the fauna had evolved through it. Now since our tipping is faster than the speed by which the climate systems can stabilise itself, there'll be a lot of extreme climates happening until the Earth reaches a new thermal equilibrium.

During the medieval warm period around the middle ages from around 900 to 1300 AD, the earth was significantly warmer than it is today. It was followed by the Maunder minimum, the little ice age from 1300 AD. Since 1900, which is where these climate cultists measure the temperatures from, the world has begun to warm up again but has still to reach the balmy temperatures of the Middle Ages. The real evidence also undermines doom-laden predictions about the effect of higher global temperatures. During the medieval warm period (With zero man-made CO2) history shows that it was a wonderful period of plenty for everyone, This is the period when most of the fantastic and wonderful medieval architecture was built. Life thrives with high CO2 levels.

All predicted by ""climate change"" scientists and propagated by irresponsible governments and misinformed news networks all over the world and of course none of it happened, thankfully there are more polar bears now than there were 20 years ago. The earth is still coming out of the last ice age believe it or not so obviously it`s very slowly getting warmer.

Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming (&#39;no position&#39;) represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics.

That co2 is increasing and it is a greenhouse gas. Can anyone deny that at least? Think about this. If the normal amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is enough to keep us just warm enough to live. What will an increase do? Don&#39;t try and convince yourselves that all this burning of fossil fuels is nothing. Because nothing in history even comes close to us using fossil fuels on a global scale and the amount of cars running at any given second. If you believe that all that co2 won&#39;t be a possible problem is silly. We create co2 on a global scale and that co2 remains in the atmosphere. The trees cannot absorb all of it, for they cannot even absorb all the naturally occurring co2. The question I pose to you.

You can muddy the waters of interpretation with vague words that are surrogates for research in order to disprove climate change. The research indicates outcomes to the world that are short of acute events but rather slow and accumulative changes that result in recurring  events such as fires in Australia or California.

In the field of climatology, this consensus is so overwhelming and thoroughly supported that dispute among the experts...that means people whose opinion matters...is non-existent. To anyone who actually understands the subject, to say that the current rapid warming the Earth is experiencing is due to human co2 emissions, is about as controversial as the claim that cigarettes increase your risk of cancer, or that evolution by natural selection is responsible for the diversity of life on Earth. Anyone who claims otherwise, including this video, is an idiot, a liar, or an idiotic liar.<br /><br /><br />One has to wonder why it is only this particular scientific consensus that is the subject of so much debate and controversy (albeit exclusively among imbeciles). Or rather, one would, if it were not already well known (among those of us who are not imbeciles) that the fossil fuel industry knowingly spread the kind of misinformation this video and similar sources are spreading.<br /><br /><br />We know that human co2 emissions are causing climate change. From co2&#39;s known properties as a greenhouse gas. From temperature records. From records of the climate throughout history. From the accurate predictions...not the ones deniers like to point to, from politicians and the media, but predictions from legitimate scientists...that nailed the rise in temperature decades in advance, based on approximate sensitivity to co2 in particular, and predicted the weakening of the polar vortex. We know that, if not for increasing concentration of co2 in the atmosphere, the Earth would be cooling. Instead, it is rapidly warming. Severe weather events are becoming more common. The ice caps are melting (In total. Regional fluctuations vary.) Sea level is rising. And the consensus is that we are facing a man-made climate crisis.<br /><br /><br />You. Are. Wrong. I advise everyone watching this nonsense to listen to the scientists, and the peer reviewed research, not a bunch of dipshits on YouTube with diarrhea of the mouth.

People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched beliefs.<br /><br />People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and illusory correlation (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).<br /><br />A series of psychological experiments in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people&#39;s conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way. However, even scientists and intelligent people can be prone to confirmation bias.<br /><br /><br />Confirmation biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor decisions due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a><br /><br /><br />I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll continue to ignore the evidence and disbelieve the data because that&#39;s what we do, just be aware that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing.",UCpMtCzLgiI5i9cRY9TEQU-Q,0,UgybyxUQ7EfDlf7Z5rd4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

There is no doubt among my peers that global warming is man made by burning oil and the unavoidable catastrophic effects on planet earth has only just begun.

CO2 is not now, and has never been, the “cause” of global warming, rather it is evidence that the global warming has taken place on average 800 prior to the marked increase in atmospheric CO2 levels.<br />Based on this broadly accepted fact alone, we can easily state that the vast majority of the increased levels of atmospheric CO2 was generated via the medieval warm period. <br />Current modern human CO2 emissions are altering out atmospheric makeup by approx. 37/10,000th of 1% per year, and even that level is debatable due to the fact that no studies have been as yet undertaken to discern if the various ecosystems of the planet are adapting to the minor increases via their increased plant growth rates; however, via satellite imagining it is readily evident that the world is “greening” at an increasing rate.<br />Science as a community truly needs to get their act together to salvage science as a trusted field of study.

The best part is when they say only 52% of respondents in the AMS survey think global warming is mostly &quot;manmade&quot;. is that a drink? They then lump all other categories together and lie about it. The next two categories are &quot;Yes; equally human and natural&quot; and &quot;Yes; mostly natural&quot; with 10% and 5% respectively. Both of these categories infer they think there is human contribution. The next category is &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; with 20%. Only 4% said global warming is not happening! Worse, only 37% of respondents consider themselves climate experts. Of those who do consider themselves experts and are in the field of climate science, 78% say &quot;yes, mostly human&quot;, with an additional 10% saying &quot;equally human and natural&quot;. Only 1% of them say it isn&#39;t happening. <br /><br /><br />Worse yet, they don&#39;t tell you there is an updated survey from 3 years later and the tally is even more in favor of a human cause. The AMS statement on climate change at the time was &quot;It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases.”<br /><br /><br />In the end this whole thing is ridiculous. Go listen to a climate scientist. Read some papers. One paper I would avoid is one written by David Legate that tries to refute information that is 10-30 years old instead of refuting the science.

Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it. If that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support. But that is not what the human species wants to do, it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with population control, it doesn't have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. Physics law two) It is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving. No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind. Now you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that's moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don't have endless space then you are going to come unstuck. This should tell you, it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing. The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer. The answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support, then you don't have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. These two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it is not a good one . If anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong, get a limited space like a cup, then show me how you can endlessly pour water into it without it ever overflowing. Without trickery , And I will admit I am wrong. I will not be losing any sleep, because to do so you will have to break the laws of physics.",UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g,1,UgxgljTlgjfv83w_sw54AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I&#39;ve been following and digging around this &quot;97% consensus&quot; thing ever since it began, and myself found it could only be better described as a &quot;100% nonsensus&quot;. The only reason the surveys by activists were conducted on people was so they could &quot;create&quot; a consensus as they already know people, whether &quot;scientists&quot; or not, have inherent biases. They chose to survey &quot;scientists&quot; to provide an obvious &quot;argument from authority&quot; position, although many of them were experts in fields other than climate. Just like surveys today, many respondents that &quot;believe&quot; CO2=bad and warming=man are often lawyers, dentists, journalists et al. <br /> <br />So fk asking erroneous, unqualified, likely highly biased and emotional mammals what they <i>think</i> , let&#39;s ask the data that&#39;s been around longer than the climate panic and therefore unbiased: <br /> <br /><a href=""http://www.globalwarming-sowhat.com/_Media/600-my-of-temps-560-my-of_med_hr.jpeg"">http://www.globalwarming-sowhat.com/_Media/600-my-of-temps-560-my-of_med_hr.jpeg </a><br /> <br />CO2 was some 15x higher in the past and never a runaway greenhouse. Temps were also some 10C higher than today. CO2 and temperature in general have little to no correlation. Looking back at the cooling from the 40&#39;s to the 70&#39;s, CO2 was also rising at the time. The panic over a &quot;catastrophic&quot; 1.5C rise by the year 2100 is just a massive lie and yet another goalpost to be shifted, considering temp shifts of the past were much larger and arrived much faster, both up and down. The planet goes through glacial/interglacial cycling about every 100k years, likely due to one of the Milankovitch cycles giving us greater solar insolation and therefore an interglacial: <br /> <br /><a href=""http://cdn.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Vostok_420ky_4curves_insolation_to_2004.jpg"">http://cdn.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Vostok_420ky_4curves_insolation_to_2004.jpg </a><br /> <br />Our current Holocene interglacial, which climate scientologists are enjoying with us now but in a panic over, has seen a 10k year downward trend: <br /> <br /><a href=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/da/26/c8da26068accf8e8e0538f5d14d019ff.jpg"">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/da/26/c8da26068accf8e8e0538f5d14d019ff.jpg </a><br /> <br />CO2 levels seem to track the interglacials well, but on closer inspection lag temp changes by some 800 years. This is also likely for CH4 levels since the land and oceans need to warm before they can outgas CH4 and CO2 respectively: <br /> <br /><a href=""http://joannenova.com.au/2009/12/carbon-rises-800-years-after-temperatures"">http://joannenova.com.au/2009/12/carbon-rises-800-years-after-temperatures </a><br /><a href=""http://joannenova.com.au/global-warming-2/ice-core-graph"">http://joannenova.com.au/global-warming-2/ice-core-graph </a><br /> <br />Water vapour is by far the most powerful &quot;greenhouse&quot; gas and blocks much of the CO2 IR absorption bands: <br /> <br /><a href=""https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405844018327415-gr1.jpg"">https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405844018327415-gr1.jpg </a><br /> <br />I prefer numbers since they lie a lot less than people.",UCZ5s1p85V2EwIZHvIUL6Xxg,0,Ugy9jn-CKeoOaG3GSQ94AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Doctors recommended them. The Earth is flat and you could fall off the edge. Some still believe it to be flat. God created all the animals and Noah saved them from the Flood. Malaria was caused by inhaling ""bad air"" (mal aria) in swampy areas. Everything is made up of the elemental forces of: air, water, fire, earth. We don't really know what the universe is made of. The smallest pieces keep getting smaller. Plank theory says there is a minimum size. It's a THEORY. There seems to be wave/particle contradictions at the quantum level that the best scientists can't reconcile. What caused the Big Bang? Where did all that matter come from? Why did it bang? What was it before it banged? What was the Jesuit professor's name who came up the the BIG BANG THEORY? Why is he NEVER mentioned? We move on when new truths are found because the incessant questioning of the status quo is required for a better understanding of the truth. When the questioning stops you have dogma. Some dogma is true, some is ""the best we know right now"". Global Warming is half truth with a motive. Study the last 20,000 years of climate to get a taste of the real truth. Further back if you want the whole truth. If you only study the last 150 years you are getting FALSE DOGMA. None of the over 70 Climate Change Models created for the ""Settled Science"" of Climate Change work in ""predicting"" the past. None of them are accurate over this time period either.

This is how he is describes himself on his own website (strange he doesn&#39;t use &quot;Dr.&quot; in front of his name on his introductory page). &quot;John Robson is a documentary film-maker, a columnist with the National Post, commentator-at-large for News Talk Radio 580 CFRA in Ottawa and an Invited Professor at the University of Ottawa (what is that supposed to mean &quot;invited&quot; professor?). He holds a Ph.D in American history from the University of Texas at Austin.&quot; Exactly how is a Professor in US history qualified to speak about science and climate change? Who is funding him and funding this video? <br /><br />Apparently Professor Robson has received funding from Mr. Drew Barnes who is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, Canada. Mr. Barnes is also an entrepreneur and businessman. He owns a number of businesses in Medicine Hat, Canada, including a construction company, a storage facility and a property management company. He also owns commercial and residential property all over southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan and has irrigation and ranch-land, raising commercial beef and rodeo stock. It&#39;s no surprise that Mr. Barnes is a big supporter of the oil industry, specifically tar sands. Barnes is also not a scientist, he holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree. Obviously it would be a wild stretch of the imagination that oil profits would in any way influence a businessman/politician. <br /><br />Burning fossil fuel is no more harmful to the environment, than smoking cigarettes is harmful to humans! For years not all doctors agreed that smoking was harmful to health and could cause cancer, at least the ones who were paid by the tobacco industry. Of course the public finally learned that the tobacco companies had known for years that smoking was dangerous and could kill you. Interesting to note that the PR campaign that was used to defend the tobacco industry is the same one that has been used to defend the oil industry. Now even Exxon-Mobil has admitted that climate change/global warming is a serious threat to the planet, although they have know that for the last 40 years or more. What does &quot;Dr.&quot; John Robson or those who have posted on this page have to say about that?<br /><a href=""https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-environment/Environmental-protection/Climate-change"">https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-environment/Environmental-protection/Climate-change</a>",UC6-sPQkhFwEiRYzs3rKPchg,0,Ugw2_lMZbc71MZR_vwh4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10
7053,UgwqvmSKPkaxi_25PZV4AaABAg,0.0,0,2020-01-09 21:50:40,runedegard,"Also as experienced by the Vikings when settling in Greenland around 1000 years ago, there are undeniable scientific proof that global warming is a cyclical phenomenon, partly as explained by the sun&#39;s irradiance and the Milanovitch cycles, precision of equinox, etc. <br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/4GUcn07enz4"">https://youtu.be/4GUcn07enz4</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/fLzXKxjFfao"">https://youtu.be/fLzXKxjFfao</a><br /><br />If it were to be mostly related to human made CO2, IPCC&#39;s scientists need to explain why are the ice-caps on Venus melting, and why is Mars and Pluto warming up? The common nominator is Sun irradiance, the difference is that there are no human created CO2 on these planets.<br /><br />Yes, it is not being denied that we recently are witnessing record high CO2 levels in the atmosphere. As good a guess is that it may stem from the increased temperature, releasing stored CO2 from the oceans. Or the not so well undertood effects of cosmic and solar climate forcing. <br /><br />Blaming humans for the global warming, however, is simply FRAUDULENT and Conspiratory. It is based on nothing but &#39;political&#39; science, i.e. fearitales. Which thousands of leaked IPCC&#39;s e-mails from 2009 (climate gate scandal ) undeniably prove. <br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/_lslIyHo6zg"">https://youtu.be/_lslIyHo6zg</a><br /><br />If human history proves anything, then it is that the future as a rule proves mainstream opinions and even &#39;science&#39; WRONG. So is it also with all the climate models forming the basis of the current political consensus. <br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/rEWoPzaDmOA"">https://youtu.be/rEWoPzaDmOA</a><br /><br />True science serves humanity by moving boundaries, creating new frontiers. While in the hands of a global conspiratory power elite it turns fraudulent, misleading and finally, suppressive.<br /><br />Like what we currently are witnessing, a new global climate religion is being socially engineered, hatched by a conspiratory power elite operating at the core of UN.<br /><br />The prophet being a well spoken mentally disoriented child, lies and fearmongering being the gospel, pseudoscience it&#39;s saviour, politicians and main stream media the disciples, while a geopolitical parasitic power elite acting as the hidden God. <br /><br />Those in denial of natural variations of the global climate are the first victims. But the real victims are those unaware of the unprecedented conspiracy in modern times, now taking place, namely the precursor to the long planned New World Order. <br /><br />UN&#39;s Agenda 21 is sought financed through ever increasing taxes on energy, a modern day &#39;indulgence&#39; ultimately bringing worldwide poverty, starvation and elimination of 80% of the global population (look up: &#39;the Georgia Guide Stone&#39;). The &#39;lucky&#39; 20% is planned to serve as slaves to the one world government. <br /><br />It follows the well-known blueprint of the old Hegelian dialectics:<br /><br />1. Engineer a problem (i.e. global warming) <br />2. Harvest a reaction (fear of extinction) <br />3. Introduce solutions (CO2 taxation)<br /><br />Following the perpetual war on terrorism, global warming appears being a &#39;noble&#39; cause of war that may easily engage people, especially when the brainwashing starts in kindergartens and primary schools. <br /><br />It is about supressing and dividing generations of people by creating existential fear. Thus becoming easy pray for the dynasty blood-line families and their controllers. <br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/iX13Dx-7Zko"">https://youtu.be/iX13Dx-7Zko</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/hr1hisvjoAI"">https://youtu.be/hr1hisvjoAI</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/5rtRL0vvUBQ"">https://youtu.be/5rtRL0vvUBQ</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/1uxJoOekxMI"">https://youtu.be/1uxJoOekxMI</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/xasfYpvVMM0"">https://youtu.be/xasfYpvVMM0</a><br /><br />These have systematically been suppressing advanced none-polluting quantum based energy technologies, first introduced by Nichola Tesla 100 years ago. Being eliminated from the history books, few are aware that he actually harnessed free energy from the air via an antenna, powering his electric car without need of charging. In doing so, he was breaking the fraudulent law of physics. <br /><br />Being a grave threat to the establishment, like D. Rockefeller, and his company Standard Oil (now, ExxonMobil), Rotschild, JP Morgan, and so on, he had to be stopped. Since, humanity have been stuck to primitive, fossil fuel dependent technologies - all controlled by these. <br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/klXj198vY4A"">https://youtu.be/klXj198vY4A</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/ecni9SjkWoM"">https://youtu.be/ecni9SjkWoM</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/Nl5NW9KcMt0"">https://youtu.be/Nl5NW9KcMt0</a><br /><br />&quot;... we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States...

Among those are the ones president Eisenhower, JFK and others warned about...<br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/Gg-jvHynP9Y"">https://youtu.be/Gg-jvHynP9Y</a><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/qvSD6If3zds"">https://youtu.be/qvSD6If3zds</a><br /><br />As a self-regulating living planetary entity Mother Earth would thrive tremendously with benign technological development. But the hidden trough is that she also would thrive with substantial increased levels of CO2 as well. And so will we, as the nature will flourish and provide foods for an ever growing population. <br /><br />Now gullible and ignorant people are being brainwashed into ignoring the real dangers, namely pollution of our food, drinking water, air, rivers, seas, forests and land. Like the immune system attacking benign tissue in the case of auto-immune syndrome, the climate alarmists are led into attacking the very social web of the global society. <br /><br />In classrooms across the Western world, this essential plant food, the nurturing gas our collective human existence depend upon, which we exhale appr. 22 tons each annually, is currently being brainwashed into the minds of our children as being a pollutant, despite being a vital part of the photosynthesis that make our greens grow, thrive and produce fresh oxygen for us to survive in the polluted air. <br /><br />We would have evolved past using fossil fuels long before nuclear fuel was invented. But since neither Rockefeller, Rotschild, JP Morgan, nor others could put a meter on abundantly and freely available quantum energy, it had to be eliminated and buried before rooted in the modern society.<br /><br />A century later, seen from Tesla&#39;s perspective, we have definitely not advanced by any measures of significance. Quite contrary, a gullible child now keep telling the world we got to return to medieval means of transport and be ashamed of our &#39;carbon footprints&#39;. While those in the know are simply demanding the release of the long kept forbidden technologies. Something like what a recently retired Air Force general talked about &quot;that can take us from one part of the planet to any other part within an hour.”<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31445/recently-retired-usaf-general-makes-eyebrow-raising-claims-about-advanced-space-technology"">https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31445/recently-retired-usaf-general-makes-eyebrow-raising-claims-about-advanced-space-technology</a><br /><br />The future of non-pollutant energy does not come to us.

There is no known power source that can create the amount of power in the time frame it is needed as fast as fossil fueled fired power plants, why not continue to heat and cool our homes with existing technology and continue to work to reduce the amount of contaminates that these facilities produce as we have been doing since the day they were invented and at the same time continue to create new facilities and technologies that can generate the same amount of power in the shortest time frame for a price either equal to or lower than the existing power producing facilities before we shut off the facilities that are now struggling to meet the worlds demand for electricity.

But hey we all have blind spots and believe a few things with blind faith. So John is a pretty good guy and I'll forgive him for that erroneous and unprovable claim that lacks any valid evidence. The only alleged evidence has been doctored up. After all the fossil that was once the main argument for dinosaurs evolving into birds, Archaeopteryx, has been thoroughly debunked. And the Chinese fossils are not to be trusted as the Chinese establishment are notorious for producing fake fossils.     I just loved learning about fake fossils like Piltdown Man and Nebraska Man. The fact that the establishment had to use fake fossils to get Darwinian Evolution established in the schools and media tells me that they so lacked legitimate transitional fossils that they were forced to manufacture fake evidence for their Darwinian fairytale. They then basically made it a crime to deny godless evolutionary theory and forced the Bible and Christian prayer out of the schools and they have been attacking Christianity ever since based on the Devils big lie.     And then they wonder why godless murderous school shooters have become commonplace and godless tyrants such as Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot tortured and murdered well over a hundred million of their own citizens based on their Darwinian beliefs that there is no God to judge their crimes against humanity and that we humans are nothing but evolved bacteria, accidents of nature, in a world of ""survival of the fittest"" or of the most powerful. Their delusional beliefs that nothing could create everything including a finely tuned universe and an oasis of life on planet Earth in a hostile to life universe, with extremely complex lifeforms that somehow emerged from a completely sterile superheated early universe requires much more faith than believing that Jesus rose from the dead showing that He was raised with what could only be Godly power.

The IPCC has never made that claim. In fact, the current head of the IPCC is railing against such claims. Most of your claims of evidence are factually incorrect. I've read studies about changes in plants. This is not new. The bird thing i cannot comment on (not sure if you're trying to say migration has changed). I DO know that last year several species of birds (and animals) were unable to breed in their traditional Greenland grounds because of too much snow. Then there is NO evidence of more extreme drought, hurricane, etc. What we SEE in Australia is the same cyclical fires they've had forever. In fact there were worse fires in the late 1800's and early 1900's into the late 30's. It was hotter and the fires were massive, burning entire states (look up Black Saturday, Black Tuesday, Black Thursday, or the Ash Wednesday fire) And just like now, they raged because of cyclical drought, poor land management and yes, even arson. (Sidebar: Did you know that the recent fires were burning while Southern AU was setting record cold temps for early January?) There are NO upward trends of hurricanes. Not in the US. America is actually cooler and wetter over the past 100 years (National Climate date site information) This information is readily available through NOAA and others, even news articles from the period, yet people continue to claim the opposite is true. There are also economic assessments that project we would spend way less money adapting to the changes (damages) of climate rather than fighting it through either destroying our economies or falling for the carbon credit Ponzi scheme proposed by so many.

Even assuming we don't know everything there is to know about gravity, even Newtonian physics models, much less more complex ones, still work very well as models to predict movement or indication of other masses in a system. In other words, those predictions work. Again, I will state that my problem with basically every climate model anyone has come up with is that none of them have managed to predict a single thing. The only thing consistent about them is that they are consistently wrong. And I feel like a good number of them are driven more by ideology than science. As well, the current focus on CO2 seems almost pointless from a scientific perspective as the earth has been an order of magnitude higher in terms of CO2 than it is right now and that CO2 is not a leading indicator of temperature but a lagging one. Add in the fact that CO2 has a logarithmic relationship with temperature and you again think we're barking up the wrong tree. Unless, as I said, there lies a greater socio-economic driver for this argument. Where's the talk on the greatest greenhouse gas of all: water vapour? Where's the discussion on how coal is literally pulling thousands out of poverty on a daily basis? How is the western world going to address the China and India situation? They certainly aren't dropping coal production and our contributions won't match theirs. What about base load electricity? How are you going to supply that without energy-dense fossil fuels? Nuclear is an awesome option. Solar and wind? Laughable. I dislike the ""science is settled"" statement because real science is almost never settled. And we have a lot more pressing things to deal with, in my opinion, than CO2. I've been on this planet a long time. I've seen hot years and cold years. Dry ones and wet ones. And I've never thought to myself ""I've never seen this before."" I've thought ""I haven't seen this since I was a kid"", but never ""This is new.""

Some that are also quoted by other studies would be nice, too :) I am very open to discuss them with you, and I would really like to hear your criticism on the methodology of climate models :) You can fix almost anything with more money, as it is the leverage for everything. But the scope of climate change is much larger than the ozone hole. The hole also exists today, it just shrank. Does it have to bang first, before we should start doing something? And ye, you only need one (very smart) person, to dispute a theory. This new theory has to be very consistent, and has to explain unexplainable errors, as well as giving the same results for a solved problem from the old theory. These are just some criteria for a new theory. But I haven't read a paper that other throws the physics behind the CC models.  If you criticise a model, you have to show its weak points and you have to do that in a scientific environment. Simply calling it ""fake"" is too easy. What is the criticism you have, and from whom do you have it? Does this person have a background in this field? If no, why are you listening to them? (I mean, you would not let a mechanic criticise a surgeon on this way of transplanting a heart, right?) When there is a truth that big, that questioning it is like questioning basic physics, it is not about consensus. Like I already said, you would not question gravity. And anyone who tells you we are not having gravity because of the planets mass would be under a hard scrutiny by you. Because I assume you are a smart guy, and you have seen that the theory that this assumption is based gave us inventions like GPS. Also a theory can only be disproven, not proven. So if they are all wrong, write a theory, make an experiment and publish it in a credited science paper (this means only the ones where you can't pay for publishing).

Some of the issue too is based on historical wolf-crying and the inevitable government cries for additional taxation to combat this. When you're constantly told that we have a scant few years or the earth will be destroyed but if we have more money, we can fix it, well...it starts to ring a little hollow. Worth noting is that when an ACTUAL emergency occurs, humanity actually DOES take steps and things get fixed. The ozone layer was being depleted, so we banned CFCs and it started to repair itself. Wildfires were crazy in the 1920s but we started vegetation management and that dropped to around 20% of its levels back then. It's gotten worse in California and Australia lately but why? Because of bans on controlled burns and vegetation management by ""environmentalists"". 100 scientists got together a long while back to dispute Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

For the EPA to claim carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas in need of regulation is nonsense. If the atmospheric levels drop below 150ppm, plants will stop conducting photsynthesis, and then we'll be in some serious trouble. There are other pollutants that should be better controlled, but most of them in other countries where they are not. It was demonstrated back in the '80s by Professor Idso (sealevel.info/CO2-pineGrowth100120_white_bg.png) how much more plant growth is facilitated by more carbon dioxide. And yet there it is on the list of Dangerous Greenhouse Gases. Absurd! Don't get me wrong; I have put 110K km on my electric car because I like clean air, and especially because I don't like religious lunatics having extra money. But the EPA is doing the wrong thing with the best of intentions. Also, read the comment I left for Larry.

Still, it's possible to do the right thing for the wrong reason. The hysteria over ""global warming"" has always been used to facilitate a power grab. (""The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary."" H.L.Mencken) Personally, I blame Gore and ""his"" Internet. And in truth, when I first heard his TED talk, I thought he was speaking the truth, too. If the problem is truly that greenhouse gases make the planet hotter *faster,* all we need do is reduce the amount of sunlight that hits the surface. A solar shield at Earth-Sun L1 should do nicely. It could be a fleet of interlocking 5mx5m panels that could be individually rotated to provide shade as needed, but that could be launched from a linac and controlled from the ground like a swarm of drones. Need more shade? Throw more drones up there. The electric linac could be solar powered, and the panels could potentially be PV-backed. The collected energy could operate the panels, and possibly maneuver them with magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters (first demonstrated in 1964; low output, but electrically-powered.) In one sense, I'm glad people are becoming aware of the fact that they must clean up after their technology. But having 16-year old OCD victims get attention for acting out about the truth they think is real is just preposterous exploitation. Kind of like I was about all those poor people who were going to burn in hell for eternity...it's just surprising how much of an influence the *first* story you get told can be, especially if you keep being told that by those around you.

Scientific consensus also means nothing if it not backed by evidence. The evidence indicates that human emissions haven't been driving the rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and that as the CO2 concentrations rise temperature in the US has fallen since 2012. Australia has been burning as of late but the news conveniently left out the fact that they've also been seeing near record winter precipitation https://electroverse.net/australias-perisher-ski-resort-is-extending-to-oct-13-making-2019-the-longest-season-on-record/ This was news for those who were interested when it was relevant during their winter. Now it's summer in Aussie land and their burning because of poor woodland maintenance which was blamed for California's fires in 2018 by their firefighters. It's funny how the Australian firefighters are saying the same but this isn't important to you because Fox News said something that means it must be the polar opposite of what is going on in reality. Because that's how real life works now. Last I checked Fox didn't mention what firefighters in Australia were saying. However I spotted a 7 News Australia clip (right here on YT) that did and at least one firefighter was very upset by the government's poor handling of their forests which is why he thinks made these fires so difficult to control. Seeing as how he is an experienced Australian firefighter being interviewed by an Australian news outlet. I'm going to take his opinion over anything I hear coming out of The United States news media. Even so Fox News' claims are similar to that firefighter meaning they're probably closer to reality than you think...

There are people who want to say that everything is about dishonesty on the part of people who want to change the energy system from carbon fueled to non carbon fueled. That confusion is coming from those who don't want that energy transformation to happen. We should change our taxes from property, sales and income taxes as they are now and lower those, especially for lower income people and increase taxes on carbon fuels at the same time. Then we should increase taxes about 150 billion a year at the federal level on the wealthy and have a federal government program to increase spending on non carbon fueled electricity, from nuclear to maintain power plants, but new wind power plants and solar power plants. Right now we (United States) spends about 50 billion a year on new renewables. We should be putting in 300 billion a year in new electricity renewables. In about 10 years, we could have most of the US electrical system run on non carbon fuels. There would be many jobs in the non carbon fueled energy economy. The many utilities who would benefit from the non carbon fueled energy would still have to maintain the electricity distribution and transmission systems. We should also reduce some other federal government spending at the same time. The only confusion is from who don't want the energy transformation to take place.

I agree with you, the US is one of the main offenders when it comes to environmental impact so it would be good if the government introduced a different taxation system as you described. The bottom line is that the funds raised from taxes can be redistributed towards a cause by the government without calling it a different name and introduction of carbon tax will lead to higher overall taxes for the regular person, because we are not living in an ideal world where everything is honest. So far the introduction of new taxes was always about getting more money, not about solving actual issues. Other countries are not doing as well and to expect everyone to follow the same plan both financially and technologically will do more damage than good, if anything, every country or region should assess it's own risks, main issues and direct resources to improve the situation, instead of submitting to the idea that reducing carbon emissions will immediately and magically solve all potential problems.

The United States economy is about 21.7 trillion dollars with over 6 trillion in taxes when adding up all the federal, state and local taxes. What if we were to increase the taxes on carbon fuels and at the same time decrease other taxes on property, sales and income taxes. Instead of sales taxes on things a person might buy at stores like Walmart, Target and restaurants, we tax carbon fuels. 45 states have sales taxes, many of those are on motor vehicles. The sales taxes on motor vehicles makes the vehicle cost more, without any value added. The sales taxes alone on motor vehicles would pay for each vehicle to be hybrid electric/internal combustion engine and would get 50 miles per gallon (mpg) or 30 mpg instead of non hybrid vehicles that get 30 mpg and 20 mpg. Instead of paying thousands of dollars in property taxes, we could pay less in property taxes and more in carbon fuels taxes. The way to reduce carbon emissions is to 1) make everything energy efficient, 2) make the electrical grid from non carbon fuel sources, and 3) get all our energy from the electrical grid. The best way to do that is to have a carbon fuels tax instead of taxing property, sales and income taxes.",UCFE_uqetp5VjoejCSB8Mz3A,1,UgyyGB0ltBr2aqCRogR4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Really, let's assume - there we start observe acceleration in warming trends. And also some start notice - it is more difficult to work in buildings (where CO2 concentrates faster ) - the response will be more vigorous and even with that acceleration of trend it's not the end of the world. Current estimations of the cost to remove 1 ton of C02 with projected technologies is $50-$100. now US (one of the most CO2 intensive country ) has 20 tons CO2 per person per year. Let's assume, that in future wind/solar/possibly new nuclear provide 90% of energy, so let's say max output of CO2 per person per year with all other sources of emissions is 10 tons. it's $500-1000 per year now I'd assume average future income in developed countries about $100 000 per year. So any catastrophe? no, even if they start not only make zero emissions, but also make additionally 10 tons of negative emissions no real harm will happen. Even if there is need for sunshade with satellites ( several trillion dollars) - EU/US/China will easily pull this. In effect we have some balance albeit not in agreement - but with two opposite sides - new technologies are developed to counter threats, but at the same time there is opposition to immediately spend trillions on older technologies and approaches.

You have to accept Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection to accept that birds descended from dinosaurs. NOTE it is a THEORY. I can’t prove to you that birds descended from dinosaurs because I can’t PROVE the theory. The evidence for Darwinism is very strong but it is still only a theory—this was hammered into us, over and over, as undergraduates. Remember this when Dr Robson presents statements from surveys asking scientists whether they believe in anthropogenic climate change. To many scientists it is still a theory that needs to be continually tested!<br /> <br />“That theory was dismissed as highly eccentric” … OR perhaps it was hypothesised and treated as an hypothesis until evidence was gathered and produced. Here is a bit of rhetoric that insinuates how silly scientists can be. Don’t give scientists theories as they will be dismissed without PROOF.<br /> <br />His characterisation of scientists being bullied and forced to conform is just an insult and a misrepresentation of the profession of science and indeed of scientific methodology. It might seem acceptable to a layman but I have worked in scientific academia as an undergraduate and a postgraduate and in science as a professional and this is absolute nonsense—scientists tend to be very specialised so they become accepted experts in very narrow subjects—they are not constantly being challenged by colleagues from other disciplines. Science is liking building a big picture from lots of little jigsaw pieces. Each scientist builds his own piece almost. That said, scientists are human beings and they make mistakes, have hierarchies and sometimes come to the wrong conclusions but not on this scale—its just not feasible that the world’s scientists are a bunch of easily led fools who are being silenced by a minority of bullies. Real nonsense.<br /> <br />The video uses rhetoric to make its point: it starts by asking who the experts are? The experts are part of scientific institutions such as CSIRO, BOM and NASA. Wrong question. Easy to find them if you looked.<br /> <br />OPEN TO INTERPRETATION<br />Dr Robson is very specific in his rhetoric on the survey results. If I was a scientist working on non-climate change science and you asked me those questions professionally I would not answer yes. That is science. As a scientist you don’t have beliefs/opinions you rely on facts. If I don’t have the facts I don’t have an opinion. See above about Darwinism.<br /> <br />FLAWED LOGIC<br />We have proven that the surveys are flawed in finding the scientific consensus so therefore climate change science is flawed<br />That the consensus is not 97% no argument from me—but just because its not 97% doesn’t mean there is not a high number of scientists in agreement<br />ALSO they deliberately misuse the word “consensus” to imply that the scientific community has an agreed position when “consensus” really just means the level of agreement  <br /> <br />BIAS (by exclusion)<br />I noticed that Dr Robson and his narrator are careful to not deny the effect of CO2 on atmospheric warming but they always downplay it “somewhat warmer now than it was in the 1800s”.  Oh really. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RATE OF CHANGE over the last 50 years.<br /><a href=""https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/"">https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</a><br />No scientists were asked their opinions—not one scientist appeared in that video<br />Cherry picking of facts<br /> <br />STRAW MAN ARGUMENT<br />The 97% consensus figure is an exaggeration that has been used by Al Gore to sensationalise his message—therefore everyone’s message is sensationalised<br /> <br />REAL SCIENCE<br />Dr Robson doesn’t attack the science he attacks the reporting of the science and then says the science is not correct etcetera …<br /> <br />NOT A CATASTROPHE?<br />Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) say 2012 was the ninth warmest year since 1880, continuing a long-term trend of rising global temperatures. The ten warmest years in the 132-year record have all occurred since 1998.

In those set of courses U should have learned about Equivalent networks. Wikipedia has a good short explanation on it. In it they talk about how even a transistor network can be analyzed using an equivalent RLC network. Its more involved then I can get into on youtube. Suffice to say that the whole idea is taking how knowledge is built on itself in all fields of Engineering and Sci. That is exactly how we predict what to do next or what to expect in doing development... U brought up nonlinear effects and U seem to think we dont know how to model that... Thats not true. A fishing pole is a nonlinear effect... Do U really think an Mech Engr cant model a fishing pole? Check out ANSYS software. It has several packages that R made specifically for looking at non linear modeling. Hell y = ex (thats e to the power of X)... Lots of things R nonlinear, the solns R not as straight forward but that doesnt mean they R not solvable... Hell most of differential equations is based on non linearity...Fluid mechanics is literally modeling based on having multiple variables yet still being able to properly model and get answers. But enough of this. The whole ques of which came 1st the heat or the CO2 argument is completely BOGUS. We know 100% that adding CO2 to the atmosphere can only cause a WARMER not a colder climate. If that werent true then the Arrhenius equation wouldnt be true and the mathematical proof of the equation would have to have bad math in it... Now if U can show exactly where that is U will become famous in all the world of Sci. But thats how Sci really works... We dont hypothesize and guess like most ppl think we do instead we compile all the known information and model and look for discrepancies and reapply them and it gets better and better. But ppl who dont realize this and think its some wild azz guess fail to understand how sci really works. Those R the ppl denier CPACs target. They actually hired an ad agency, the same one big tobacco used in the 70s.. Their model is not to convince ppl that Sci is wrong..thats too hard to do.

If it were, circuit simulation software (which is much better developed than atmosphere simulation software) would be 100% accurate 100% of the time, and it's not. Diodes, transistors and much more besides exhibit various different non-linear effects and that means that for any analog system, you'd be crazy to make commercial decisions based on simulations only. You have to build a prototype and observe it. Now, when you said ""we hold all other variable still and see what diff adding CO2 makes"" - you have inadvertently outlined the central problem in all this. We _can't_ fix variables in the real atmosphere. We can fix their values in a simulation, but the result of the simulation may not match reality at all, and the fact that the real temperature curve keeps barely clinging to the bottom range of the IPCC's predictions, even with all the highly dubious 'help' they have given their datasets, strongly suggests to me that the simulations are not at all reflective of reality. That and the fact that CO2 is not seen to lead temperature in the paleo record. Coming on to the tipping point idea - that is pure speculation. The Earth has been significantly warmer than it is today (also, CO2 has been much higher long ago) - and the planet didn't burn up, so I can't see the justification for that hypothesis. Again, I am not advocating doing nothing, or staying with dirty energy tech, or increasing CO2 indefinitely. I think all of those would be terrible mistakes. I just don't believe the current scenario of imminent climate disaster that's being marketed to us so forcefully that even to ask why we're using downward-adjusted historical temp readings rather than raw data is seen as a form of blasphemy.",UC9Sp-1kMIRyIKubhm4abJQg,1,UgyxdLMph0aLTmMtbPt4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Thats actually the opp of what is done. When we have complex sys we break them up and remove variables 1st, then analyze with known using proven factual relations.. U brought up ohms law, fine... It might be a very complex circuit but ALL circuits break down into resistance, capacitance and inductance … It can literally all be modeled into that... Equations applied to it and corresponding voltages, and currents can be found... Thats how we know if what we have is what we should have.. So when it comes to does CO2 cause GW we hold all other variable still and see what diff adding CO2 makes... Guess what it goes up like Arrhenius said it would! That means Delta Temp = 1.66 Ln(C/C0)... We know how other gases effect the temp., but theyre not chging like CO2 is chging We know this because all the gases get measured. Whenever anything carbon based is burned we make CO2... Since we burn a hell of a lot Carbon based things much much more than we did 200 yrs ago we know that CO2 is jump starting the warming process... After the rising CO2 levels have released trapped gases in otherwise frozen ice then CO2 may no longer be the biggest prob... But that is because much much more powerful hydrocarbons. nitrous oxides, etc will be released with much much more heat retention capabilities... This is why just a few degrees matter... Passing a tipping pt could mean GW happens all on its OWN... After then it wont matter what we do about CO2 because the atmosphere can warm itself, all on its own and there might not be a damn thing we can do to stop it!

While it was certainly a seminal work, it is not reasonable to expect any one equation (or set of equations) to properly describe the behaviour of a highly complex system in which multiple other processes are going on. Ohm's Law makes a good analogy. Is it true? Yes. Is it vital to the analysis and design of circuits? Yes. On its own, can it get anywhere near describing the behaviour of modern circuits? No it cannot. Believe it or not, I actually care deeply about the health of this irreplaceable planet, but I think that AGW has been built up into something that it's not for reasons that are entirely political. I am much more concerned about rapid exhaustion of limited natural resources, pollution of rivers and aquifers, destruction of ancient mature forests for production of toilet rolls and the absolutely horrendous nuclear waste storage problem that we are creating for ourselves, but these receive practically no airtime now, and I don't think that is a coincidence. Where you and I perhaps differ most is in what we think is happening to the climate right now.

Later as more and more ice melts and organic rot decomposes and release much more powerful grn house gases like CH4 then no CO2 may not be the big driver of a hotter and hotter climate... But it certainly starts with us producing much much more CO2 then we did 200 yrs ago. What ppl dont understand its once we pass tipping pts it will still get warmer and warmer even if we stop adding CO2. We have a pretty good idea whats trapped in ice and permafrost and if that melts then gases trapped in ice are released into the atmosphere. That is well understood.

There is plenty of raw evidence that global warming has been going on for 10&#39;s of thousands of years on this planet. Researchers have discovered entire cities which lie just a few meters underwater off of nearly every coast line in the world. Scientist assume that these cities must have been built before the or during the ice age when ocean levels were much lower than they are today since the cities were obviously not built under water. So that dates them to pre 10,000 BC at least. Nobody was burning fossil fuels back then that we know of, so what caused the earth to start warming up 10,000 years ago? This whole notion that CO2 is warming our globe is complete BS, in fact if you look at the data collected you will see that the rise in CO2 levels follows the warming trends not leading them. I believe that this demonizing of CO2 is a sinister plot to try to create global famine by reducing CO2 levels to the point that plants will no longer be able to grow and produce food for both People and livestock. They are doing this in an attempt to usher in the new world order, where a one world dictatorship governs the people.

7494,UgxuJwiSFEYJTDZ4UWB4AaABAg,1.0,1,2020-01-08 11:49:28,Andrew Mckay,"Climate change is only small not as they are putting it all over the media. The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn’t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is CO2 that is man made.

The answer lies in two simple laws of physics. Physic law one) It is physically impossible to endlessly put something into something that is not endless. Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it. If that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support. But that is not what the human species wants to do, it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with population control, it doesn't have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. Physics law two) It is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving. No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind. Now you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that's moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don't have endless space then you are going to come unstuck. This should tell you, it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing. The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer. The answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support, then you don't have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. These two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it is not a good one . If anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong, get a limited space like a cup, then show me how you can endlessly pour water into it without it ever overflowing. Without trickery , And I will admit I am wrong. I will not be losing any sleep, because to do so you will have to break the laws of physics.",UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g,1,UgyysvlVt15Mfgfly_54AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

One may notice, that nothing of this has anything to do with content of the video, but this is how many activists and politicians describe the issue. So you then have even people like AOC saying the whole world will actually end in ten years. But even academic website Conversation says in one of its articles that Earth will be &quot;destroyed&quot; by CO2 in few years. Destroyed like annihilated? Well, manner of speech, but it kind of shows us unscientific attitude, which seems to be mainly around the alarmist viewpoint.<br /><br /><br />And weird is that similar attitude is around &quot;the solutions&quot;. Well climate is complex thing but why there is the same stiffness around the solutions like solar panels and wind farms? There is not that much scientific open questions and these things are more easily calculated etc. And we know, how many steel and concrete one needs for building wind farm, and that it actually kills a lot of birds, bats and insects. And local residents are protesting because of the noise and so on and so on. Same for toxic metals released to the rivers in China when building solar panels. The need of rare earth metals and other issues are like tabu. Suddenly one is considered denialist even in discussion about energy alternative solutions. The green energy critics may be wrong, but there is almost no effort do disprove their arguments and wind farms and solar panels are presented as 100 percent environmental friendly energy, which is only delayed by the greedy oily capitalists and capitalism itself and suddenly you get the picture of the whole issue apparently.

Obviously, you have a different definition of what's safe and clean. I haven't heard anyone say we must immediately stop using fossil fuels to produce electricity. In the meantime everything we can do to reduce the amount of fossil fuels being burned, if nothing else helps reduce pollution. As for cheep energy, it wouldn't be as cheep without the billions of dollars that subsidize the fossil fuel industry every year, hydro and nuclear are also subsidized but to a much lesser degree, as is solar and wind. Consider the source, all the arguments against renewable energy have originated with and have been promoted by the fossil fuel industry and apparently you have no problem with their FAT bank accounts. Although in recent years Exxon-Mobil and Chevron among other oil companies have changed their tune. Their own scientists have known for years that burning fossil fuel is detrimental to the environment, the climate, and human health. True the sun doesn't always shine and the biggest problem is producing batteries that can store enough energy during those periods. If governments invested to solve this problem with the same gusto and money the US did, to create nuclear weapons in order to slaughter people on a massive scale we'd already have those batteries. Although Casey, if you believe that smoking cigarettes isn't dangerous to a person's health, then you will never believe that burning fossil fuel is dangerous to the planet and every living thing on it. The tobacco industry during the 1960's used a PR company, Hill & Knowlton, to counter medical information that smoking was dangerous. They didn't attack doctors, instead they came up with a campaign to create DOUBT, they claimed that ALL doctors didn't agree that smoking was dangerous. They employed their own doctors who claimed that there wasn't overwhelming evidence that smoking was harmful. Fred Seitz who was a government physicist that later worked for RJ Reynolds, when asked later about the misleading PR campaign said, ""If people wanted to believe that, it was their own doing."" and when asked if it was irresponsible on the part of the tobacco companies, he responded by saying, ""it was irresponsible on the part of the smokers."" The oil industry has employed the same PR campaign the tobacco industry used to create ""doubt"" about the science. They also hired Fred Seitz and Fred Singer, who you may have heard of and who also worked on the pro tobacco PR campaign, to work on this misinformation campaign and they have done an excellent job of creating doubt and confusion among the public.",UC6-sPQkhFwEiRYzs3rKPchg,1,UgwV6YK3LbyreHfTqGJ4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

I've done the math and double-checked the stats. 10 hours of sunlight per day * square footage of panel * kw/h energy output/sq. Ft of panel (which is a function of its efficiency * energy input from the Sun). And that has to equal global consumption as of calendar year 2018. It's very basic mathematics. The Sun does shine enough south of London to power all of England, Wales, and Scotland on a combination of solar and wind (and the wind never stops blowing in the UK, Scotland especially). Germany was able to run off of nothing but solar and battery power for three entire days in 2017. Now, I wouldn't build all of those panel farms until we're in the 40+% efficiency range, but to say it can't be done is hogwash. You may have to transfer in electricity from other states or countries on very rare occasion, but the grid needs to be upgraded for that kind of feedback capability anyway for entirely different reasons such as resiliency. Nuclear is nowhere near safe, as Japan and France have demonstrated in the last decade. You're the one swallowing propaganda.

The simple fact that you cannot guarantee that there will always be enough sunlight to power the grid is more than a huge problem. Coal, natural gas and nuclear are without question the safest, cleanest, most reliable, most available and most cost effective way to power the planet. I mean try powering London solely on solar. You would have chaos because the sun doesn’t shine there consistently enough to power the grid non stop. That is a fact. What you said isn’t something you came up with. It’s something a bunch of really smart well funded people with gains to be made from the solar industry sham put out for you to lap up like mothers milk. Just like high speed rail in CA.

And most experts in the field have been saying for 2 decades that solar was very likely to work as long as panel efficiency continued to improve at a healthy pace. There's good money to be made in solar panels for good reason. With the best panels available today, only 30% efficient, you'd only need to cover an area as large as Spain to power the entire world at current consumption rates. With graphene-based prototypes (no rare earth metals required) already hitting 45% efficiency, solar has huge potential. And with saltwater-carbon batteries catching up to Lithium-Ion in terms of storage density and discharge capability, the problem of intermittent generation when the Sun isn't shining is vastly cancelled out. Also, the toxic manufacturing and disposal of Lith-ion components goes away. I'm happy to embrace sustainable biofuels, especially for aviation and naval use where taking the extra weight with you the entire trip just isn't practical, but I'm afraid the trends in cost and technology are such that, not only is solar becoming safer and more stable, but it's becoming cheaper and will easily be cheaper than natural gas as a structural energy source by 2040.",UCqiQ6GXTpXTcjDv1iAOR__w,1,UgwV6YK3LbyreHfTqGJ4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

This is true land of confusion. What never ceases to amaze me here is that you are pointing to industrialization but are completely ignoring the fact that industrialization requires customers, who have quadrupled since then. You can't say that though, because that would make you a fascist and thus your science simply pretends that I am able to drive four cars at the same time. The science on the man made global warming these has been politicized and hence it has become flawed. And a final anecdote: Dutch government aims to invest over half a million million euros (that's a five followed by 11 zeros) to make their country completely emissions free by 2050. Scientists predict that this will dampen temperature rise by 0.00007 degrees Celsius in the year 2100. For some reason they do not seem worried one little bit about sea levels being predicted to rise by several meters, which to me appears to practically guarantee that they will be successful in making the country emissions free as it will be completely flooded.

Hope you can read English. Doesn't take a genius to read their conclusions for yourself. These papers show a bias and the AMS paper tries to cover what drives the bias. Regardless no one has actually proven there is a 97% consensus and every paper that shows one - like Cook's own - was manufactured to show a consensus where none exists. These scientists count on you to be uninformed and are assuming you will not to read their papers. When you do you learn about the lie. Makes me wonder why they leave it up. I'm surprised it's gotten so little attention up to this point even though as mentioned it was really big news nearly 16 years ago and those fires were reignited in 2013.

The answer lies in two simple laws of physics. Physic law one) It is physically impossible to endlessly put something into something that is not endless. Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it. If that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support. But that is not what the human species wants to do, it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with population control, it doesn't have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. Physics law two) It is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving. No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind. Now you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that's moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don't have endless space then you are going to come unstuck. This should tell you, it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing. The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer. The answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support, then you don't have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. These two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it is not a good one . If anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong, get a limited space like a cup, then show me how you can endlessly pour water into it without it ever overflowing. Without trickery , And I will admit I am wrong. I will not be losing any sleep, because to do so you will have to break the laws of physics.",UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g,1,Ugwc_0cLVmJpRO-386x4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Sudden Changes in climate caused it to dry up, then another sudden change in the climate filled up the Mediterranean.

Some of this is new, but some of it was summarised in a special report on extreme events the IPCC published in 2012. We’ve experienced more hot days and heat waves, fewer cold nights, and an increase in the intensity and number of heavy rainfall events. For many of these changes, a human ‘fingerprint’ or influence can be seen. The new IPCC report states it’s very likely (at least 90 per cent certain) humans contributed to the increase in hot days and decrease in cold days. For heat waves, it’s likely (at least 66 per cent certain) human activities were a contributing factor – scientists can’t be more certain because they don’t have as much data on heatwaves to draw conclusions from..https://www.carbonbrief.org/what-the-ipcc-report-says-about-extreme-weather-events",UCy2EpB2iMMLJJOrRlg6CgeA,1,Ugwc_0cLVmJpRO-386x4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

Some of these where on a hypothetical scenario, where sulphuric acid aerosol levels would rise to 10 times the amount of the seventies, which would result in a cooling strong enough for a new glacial, if maintained for centuries (even for the 70s an already unlikely development). The other part were about the Milankovic cycles, which proposed a glacial in several 10.000 years, if there wasn't any radiativ forcing by green house gases to counteract that.

An internal London Metropolitan Police (Scotland Yard) letter, obtained by the BBC's Newsnight during a British investigation into the death says: ""The Schiller Institute and the LaRouche Youth Movement... blames the Jewish people for the Iraq war and all the other problems in the world. Madhav Khandekar is a retired Environment Canada scientist. The Heartland Institute (who gave you smoking does not cause cancer and are running the same screen for oil companies ) describes him as ""an environmental consultant on extreme weather events and a scientist with the Natural Resources Stewardship Project."" According to internal budget and strategy documents from the Heartland Institute, Khandekar has recieved $1,000 per month. Madhav Khandekar, Cliff Ollier, and Arthur Middleton Hughes publish a book titled About Face!: Why the World Needs More Carbon Dioxide; The Failed Science of Global Warming. The book’s trio of authors encourage ramping up CO2 levels, by way of increased fossil fuel use, “to allow more plants to grow and combat rising levels of malnutrition.” [14] According to a search of 22,000 academic journals, Khandekar has published 19 pieces of research in peer-reviewed journals, mainly in the area of El Nino and climate. Many of his papers on climate change were published in the journal Energy and Environment , a journal seen as a front for oil companies which has been criticized for its peer review process and which is edited by global warming skeptic Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen. When asked about the publication in the Spring of 2003 Boehmer-Christiansen said, ""I'm following my political agenda -- a bit, anyway.

As to CO2, it works in a similar way to water in a microwave oven, in that it is resonant (and thus absorbs and re-radiates heat energy) at frequencies in the microwave bands, but the foremost scientist in the CO2 Radiative Transfer field (a Princeton professor no less) is very sceptical of CO2 having an unlimited warming capacity. CO2 has only a relatively narrow absorption bandwidth, while H2O has a far broader absorption bandwidth, there is a lot more of it, and goes semi-opaque when it condenses, reflecting incoming radiation back into space. CO2 doesn't generally condense, if only because it is not present in sufficient density in the atmosphere (~400ppm). This is physics, not chemistry, although most chemistry is applied physics...

All other science is ok, but climate science is somehow fraudulent even though the majority of practicing scientists know that it's a no-brainer and the evidence is overwhelmingly clear. They can see quasars 10 billion light years away, decode the human genome, build instruments sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves from violent explosions billions of years ago but when it comes to carbon (chemistry is a very well understood field at that) somehow there's great mystery and it cannot be understood (except for youtube researchers) by anyone. This is so far beyond stupid that it really shows how gullible the larger population is and also highlights how scientifically illiterate the average person really is. Many things in science are counter-intuitive and complex and many things beggar belief but data shows that often our beliefs and ideas are false. The climate denialist always showcases simplistic black & white thought processes which are always fallacies.

The sources are not given in Hellers video description, as in all others I have seen sofar (which is at least malpractice if he were a researcher). So I link Heller's video with timestamps, just pause the video and read for yourself (I did): Koalas face extinction; Nass(?) Tribune Courier, August 19., 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=61 the article references ""Koala Club"", whatever that is, and doesn't make a connection with climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification (the term mostly used before the 70's), or similar terms, but with the fires and weather. I could not find a peer-reviewed publication on this. Hottest day on record in three capitals; The Advocate; January 11., 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=76 Just about the weather, which might have been unprecedented for that time. No mention of Koalas, no mention of climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification, or similar terms. (now I am wondering if these kind of temperatures are more common today). Bushfire damage - danger not yet over; the Sydney Morning Herald, February 1., 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=86 This one is about the fires of 1939 and the damage it did until the article was written. Compare that to the damage today. No mention of koalas, no mention of climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification, or similar terms. Instead a bit on the weather Burkey's new heat record, Coff's Harbour and Dorrigo Advocate, February 3, 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=88 Just a statement on the abnormal weather. No mention of Koalas, no mention of climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification, or similar terms. State's blanket in heat, The Sydney Morning Herald, January 13, 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=111 A statement on the weather. No mention of koalas, no mention of climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification, or similar terms. Victorian scenic drive no desolate ruin, The Sydney Morning Herald, January 13, 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=124 Short quote on the damage done by the fires. Again no mention of koalas, no mention of climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification, or similar terms. Four killed by heatwave, January 12, 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=129 A short on the damage done by the heat wave. No mention of koalas, no mention of climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification, or similar terms (I am repeating myself, i know). Trains halted when rail line buckles, january 12, 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=138 It's on the damage done by the heat wave. No mention of koalas, no mention of climate change, global warming, inadvertend climate modification, or similar terms. Non of these articles where on the topic of climate, the change therof or referenced a scientist, non linked the endangerment of any marsupials to climate change. Which is not surprising, because the effects were far less obvious then as they are now, observations on climate change not really known to the public and in science only just an emerging field lacking most of todays equipement. So, even if the heat wave of 1939 Australia was caused by athropogenic climate change, the media would not have known and as you see, the media did not make the connection. Nor do I. But you might say, I left out a news paper. This one: Greenlands glaciers melting, says scientist, Harrisburg Sunday Courier, December 17, 1939 https://youtu.be/VZVidfAbVT0?t=146 It is a short one on greenlands glaciers ... a year later ... on the other side of the world ... And I cite from the news article: _Everything points to the fact, that the climate in the _*_region_*_ has grown warmer during recent years_ (emphasis by me). TH uses this to make the connection between ""the media"", climate change and the 1939 australian heat wave. Though the news article did not make a connection to Australia, it might have been related to a changing climate in australia, but ""the media"" did not say that. Tony Heller made a claim, you made your version of it, all without checking it. If you wanted to, you could have tried to find the source for the greenland glacier statement in a scientific journal to check if the researcher made a well founded connection to the australian heat wave or marsupial extinction events. After all the researcher cited has a number of publications, but you decided not to, didn't you? You just believe Tony. Because Tony knows best? What comes afterwards is claimed to be of todays media coverage (again no sources) and nothing more from 1939. Oh, and 30 seconds of THs fear mongering, and I thought only the brainwashed climate alarmists do that ...

I believe that setting up a survey to get a policy-relevant answer is hard. Think about what question you would ask. The questions have to determine if changing mankind's CO2 emissions would make a big enough difference on climate-related impacts to justify the costs. The impacts are risk assessments and that adds another layer of complexity. It is a wicked problem! My point in the initial reply was that even if you come up with good survey questions, there are a limited number of scientists with the background and experience to be able to answer those questions independently and justify their answers. There are a larger number but still relatively small number of people who can understand the answers to be able to favor one opinion over another. The problem I have with many of these surveys is that there is no qualification to limit participation to those people who have slogged through the background information so we can trust their answer. Thinking outside the box is fine but if you don't understand the box then your answer is a guess.",UCu0tce190piV3Fv3D0cTphg,1,Ugys4RdlZbyPQWISDdR4AaABAg,ewJ6TI8ccAw,2019-05-09 17:51:10

The Canadian media preaches it daily in their daily newscasts. I don&#39;t watch much American News but I have long believed that there is a lot of misinformation out there and the most often quote I hear is that 97 percent of Climate Scientists endorse the view that the Globe is Warming. I have Googled and seldom have I heard any scientist claim that the globe is warming in any significant way but nothing approaching a dangerous way. Yet the Media is pushing this story on people and most importantly groups like Extinction Rebellion and other deceitful groups are spreading this fraud. Through Social Media the youth of North America and Europe have bought in to this narrative. Now if you present any evidence contrary to these fraudulent views you are labelled a Climate Change Denier. It&#39;s absolutely crazy especially when the leaders of the US like Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau have been pushing this crazy notion.

It does my head in, any time a hurricane , volcano, fire or slightly different temperature occurs which has been going on every day since we’ve been alive, the new reaction by the media and any other brainwashed numpty that wants to comment is “duh climate change” How seriously has Trump bamboozled us? Just cos he doesn’t buy the daily pounding by news outlets that shove climate change down our throats , how is that bamboozling? Mainstream media has become a joke, and their agenda is worldwide in western countries. That is the real bamboozling.

The only “science” I’ve seen from the side that’s pushed by the media is cherry picked and skewed. The side making more sense to me are the ones debunking the alarmists with much more data being taken into account than just small graphs pulled out to suit an agenda. As I believe this “science” is no where near settled and not supported by the 90 plus percent of scientists they claim that it is, I’m still willing for the climate doomsdayers to provide actual credible evidence of this really happening due to the burning of fossil fuels... Without providing a link to mainstream media for their proof. All I hear is ...”listen to the science, listen to the science” Yeah I’m listening and the only side that’s making any sense at the moment to me are the ones debunking the bullshit. I want to be provided with links that tell us who the 97 percent of scientists are that support this and what their actual beliefs are with a scientific reasoning behind it .
