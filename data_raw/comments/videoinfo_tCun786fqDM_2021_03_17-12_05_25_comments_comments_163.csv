Or do they only agree about global warming then changed it to climate change after all their predictions about calamity since the 1970's onward have failed to happen. Global warming was based on warming weather patterns in the 90s and early 2000s. Since then there has been a cooling in the weather. Human beings agree on very little, religious beliefs, political beliefs vary greatly, economics also. But you would have it climate scientists all sing from the same song sheet. I don't think so. Do your own research, you wouldn't trust mine anyway. There is plenty of contrary evidence out there. The carbon gases that supposedly cause global warming make up 0.004% per cent of the atmosphere. That tiny amount is going to warm up and melt Antarctica, the artic ice and warm the artic ocean, the southern ocean, also the Atlantic ocean, Pacific ocean and the Indian ocean. Yet the atmosphere is much thinner than the seas, and 0.004 of the atmosphere will heat the oceans which at their deepest could drown the highest mountains if those mountains were placed on the ocean floor? Even though science know nothing about the deepest darkest parts of the ocean. So how do science know what will happen in the frigid depths of the ocean untouched by any light from the sun?
