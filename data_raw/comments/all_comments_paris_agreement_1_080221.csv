The earth's average temperature began rising at a MUCH faster rate than ANY cyclic, normal climatic shifts after the Industrial Revolution. That sun warming shit you're babbling about is complete nonsense. The sun changes temperature and luminosity very slowly and has a negligible affect on the short-term climate change we're experiencing. We have thown off the balance of greenhouse gasses by pumping it into the air. The carbon dioxide we're releasing into the atmosphere is a great absorber of radiation in the infared spectrum. This prevents the Earth from cooling properly, as the primary way the Earth cools is by radiating infared waves. This is similar to how a greenhouse works, thus their names. Water vapor is also a very effective greenhouse gas. Warmer seas and air mean more water vapor. If you were to look at a temperature graph of the Earth over thousands and thousands of years, you would see large, sprawling temperature fluctuations over very long periods of time. Currently, the Earth's average temperature is rising at an exponentially faster rate than what is normal over the past millions of years, and it started when we began releasing greenhouse gases.

ranting how he doesn't need Uncle Sam Anymore. Tajani works as a team 
with Merkel and it's mostly her who puts words into Tajani's mouth. The 
Germans don't have that much credibility left on the issue since their 
automakers constantly falsify emissions data, so they have to use an 
Italian. China, India, Brazil, Africa - all of them are loathing the 
mighty Eurocrats. Even Japan refused to sign the Kyoto. And this E.U. 
chief will proudly carry the eco banner expecting the whole world to 
flock to it, or else!
Europe will remain the continent of the unemployed since all industry will bolt unable to meet the carbon emissions requirements. The U.S. position on this issue is pragmatic and cuts itself off from this madness.
Moreover, the media have been warning in the recent days that 
Ethiopia is sending out warning that 7.8 million of its people are 
starving, meaning it will attack the West with its refugees. If they try to 
cross into Europe they should be sent back the same day, and if they 
persist and cross into Europe, army should take over and they should 
use bullets, since another nation said it will stage an invasion. 
Let the ""climatic refugees"" go to China or India 
or any country in Africa, all of which have very weak or non-existent 
emissions laws. Why don't the Africans learn to stop breeding? This has 
far greater reprecussions on starvation than the lack of Chinese or 
Indian pollution laws. If refugees try to cross into Europe, they should
 be sterilized the same day in good faith and then sent back.",0.0,0.0,,jP55meWlLt4,

Reducing the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is going to reduce the effects of said greenhouse gas. Unfortunately the effects are irreversible for long periods of time, so humanity really needs to cut emissions before things get worse. In that sense the Paris accord won't reduce carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere, it only reduces EMISSIONS. The good news is that we've only been producing greenhouse gasses for a very short period of time in Earth's history, and the effects of global warming do not yet threaten our existence.

One of his former justifications for his denial of climate change was ""My point is, God‚Äôs still up there. The arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is to me outrageous.‚Äù That is religious dogmaticism and it will cost lives in the long run if leaving the agreement is pursued by Trump's admin. 

The Guardian reported last year how a receding Lake Chad in Africa which provides livelihoods to the populations of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria has lost surface area  from approximately 25,000 km2 to 1,350 km2 in the space of 40 years. Global warming plays a role in this, alongside the issue of underdevelopment which the Paris Agreement was partly established to address. ¬£2 billion worth of environmental aid from the US was to be given to poorer countries to ensure they do not suffer the consequences of global warming. A direct consequence of Lake Chad's recession has been and will continue to be mass migration of people who can no longer depend on their most plentiful resource for fishing, water, sanitation and irrigation in the region. 

Some people like to think a loose canon of an American president/government will not effect them. When the Far-Right tell you the peoples of the global South are coming for your wealth and nothing more you should maybe consider the causes of why mass migration occurs and how it could be stopped rather than looking for simple solutions.

But essentially the CO2 emitted from certain plants and animals gets taken into the atmosphere. Plant life such as trees and algae absorb this CO2 transferring it into Glucose and Oxygen as a by-product. Thereby cleaning the atmosphere of its CO2 content

There is one thing I will give you... some credit. The planet is in fact doomed, everything is, however, there are things that we can do to mitigate the effects that change the environment. A good example of this was after the industrial revolution were we noticed the effects that pollution had on our environment, we then cut down or moved the factories into different areas and switched to cleaner sources of energy (coal to natural gas). Since then pollution has gone down significantly, and major post-industrial cities such as London are now habitable and safe. 

So yes, the planet is in essence 'doomed' however, we as a species should take the initiative to preserve it for us and the future generations to come.",0.0,1.0,,jP55meWlLt4,

This hoax was started by Scientists from the Dupont corporation. Dupont had a patent on freeon refrigerant that was about to expire, which would have meant others could copy their freeon patent and start selling it. They developed a new R134a refrigerant and got it patented. Next they paid their scientists to convince the government to ban freeon, because it was destroying the ozone layer and causing global warming. Once this global warming hoax started it snowballed through parts of the scientific community. Then all of a sudden we started having record cold temperatures, and Al Gore actually had to cancel a global warming rally due to a blizzard and extremely cold temperatures. When they started looking like fools, they decided instead of global warming, it's climate change¬†which causes¬†extreme cold and extreme heat. They said the ice caps were melting in the extremely hot summers¬†and it would cause ocean levels to rise. Melting ice does not cause ocean levels to rise. Go fill a glass with ice water and measure the level after the ice melts and you'll see the water level has dropped. That same ice melt in the Artic that they were showing has now refrozen so this shows once again that these scientists are stupid. There are numerous scientists that show data that we are not having climate change, but these idiots don't want to look at data that proves them wrong. We've only been keeping temperature records since around a hundred years ago, and back in the 1700's when my Grandfather General John Sevier was fighting the British and their native allies, he wrote about an extremely cold winter when the rivers were frozen over in the south.

The Paris Climate Agreement is an agreement for individual countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each country makes a national agreement to how much they would reduce those greenhouse gas emissions for each year starting from December 2016. Each year there will be a $100 billion budget, provided by the U.S, in order to help other still developing nations to get clean energy (however, this is only between 2020~2025). http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climatechange/
http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change-2/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement

This agreement was an agreement made by leaders all around to world to make OUR planet sustainable. Green house gas emissions are no joke because they DO increase the temperature of our world.
https://climate.nasa.gov/

The U.S and China are leading countries in green house gas emissions. However, China has recently cleaned up their act and agreed to reduce their green house gas emissions by 20%, and the U.S agreed to reduce it by 17% (that is before Trump decided to pull away from it).
In addition, China has increased their renewable energy output by 23% by the year 2014. You have to understand that renewable energy was used to generate power for 23% of the entire country. 
Lastly, Trump going out of the Paris Agreement is foolish in not only protecting the planet that we are living in, but also us as a nation. By stepping away from the Paris Agreement, the U.S is showing weakness and its inability to cooperate with foreign nations to do something that has never been done before; a global project to save our WORLD.
It's funny how you say that I haven't read the UN reports. In addition, it's extremely disturbing how you say that NASA's head environmental experts say that they disagree with my statement. 

Please READ and do your RESEARCH and put up a VALID argument with FACTS, EVIDENCE, CITATIONS, and overall be knowledgeable AMERICAN. You're arguing like someone from middle school, and you're a full grown adult. Argue like an adult and take time to write down your argument.

‚Ä™That explains Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Climate deal while also giving the Russians their compound in Maryland back. To think 81% of Republicans support America staying in the Paris Agreement and we are sacrificing all that and risking the future of our planet on stupid political reasons is incredible. We are now gladly joining a terror ravaged Syria and and a confused and unknown Nicaragua as the only 3 countries outside the Climate deal. What a company to join! Today, America has relinquished its leadership of the free world and China is excited to take the baton. ‚Ä¨

However, the environmental impacts of Trump pulling out of this will affect every single human being on the planet (in and outside the USA) negatively. Whilst you may argue that the agreement wouldn't cause much of a decrease in global temperatures, the main benefit from the agreement was that it would limit potential increases in global temperatures, which would prevent the issue of global warming becoming much worse than it already is.

However, as the USA is now free to pollute however it wants, it means that global temperatures are definitely going to increase much faster (as a result of global warming incuded by extra greenhouse gases released by the USA as they now have no obligation to cut down on emissions), causing things such as more frequent extreme weather events (like hurricanes, due to the oceans being warmer, allowing more hurricanes to form over larger areas of the oceans which will be warm enough for hurricanes to form, over longer hurricane seasons, as well as droughts in areas further away from the oceans), sea levels rising (due to melting ice shelves), and generally screwing up the weather over the entire world.

These impacts will negatively affect the USA as well.

The areas around the east coast and the Gulf of Mexico are likely to be destroyed by a mixture of hurricanes and rising sea levels (you remember how New Orleans looked after getting hit by Hurrcane Katrina's storm surge? That, but permanent and all over the seaside areas of the USA), whilst the midwest will suffer rather large droughts and winds, making it just like how it was during the 1930s Dust Bowl, causing the USA's agriculture (production of crops, which is vital to ensuring that there is actually food for the USA) to be destroyed.

After this stuff, which, due to America's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords, will happen much sooner than if the USA stayed, the USA will be damaged beyond repair. By prioritizing short term economic benefits (any benefits from withdrawing from this) before long term economic benefits (the benefits provided by having simple things like having agriculture, decent weather, not having entire cities uninhabitable due to permanent sea-level rises, etc.), your president has fucked over your country.

But he probably doesn't care. He's old, and he knows that he's probably going to die of old age shortly after (or before) he gets impeached/loses the 2020 election/reaches the end of his 2nd term in 2024, so he doesn't give a single shit what will happen 10 years from now.

According to them, most if not all papers published do not consider changes in solar radiation as a possible cause. This current warming cycle we are in only began in the middle of the last century (well into the industrial revolution). Up until then, the planet was in a cooling cycle. Lastly, there is evidence of vineyards and wine making in central London indicating that the climate was much warmer in times gone by.

The amount of CO2 dumped into the atmosphere doesn't matter if O2 rises along with the amount added.

The Average Global Temperature did NOT rise 8 degrees since 1880, It rose 3 Degrees and NO it's NOT a steady climb its warmer some years and colder during others. The largest amount of CO2 dumped into the Atmosphere does not come from Man made sources, It comes from decaying vegetation. 800 billion tons of CO2 is generated every year from decaying vegetable matter. 80 billion tonnes is generated from Man made sources ( Including breathing ) of those 880 billion tonnes of co2 dumped into the atmosphere 879.002 tonnes is converted to O2 through plant respiration.

However, this is the same group of people that pray to a god that they cannot ever prove is true, and act in precautionary ways to attempt to appease that god.  Both climate change and god  are forces that can supposedly change the Earth dramatically, and advocates for both will claim that what you do today may determine both your and our future.

Further the idea ignores real data like warming has leveled off during last 10 years and was cooling during 70s and there was a little thing called the little ice ages in  1650, 1770, and 1850 (during middle of industrial revolution where the thames and hudson froze over) cuz the SUN is the primary cause of the earth heating and cooling and these trends follow sun activity - PS the sun is being really inactive right now, maybe that's why its not warming as predicted.

There have been plenty of times throughout history were commonly agreed upon scientific conclusions were later disproven, and there were also rejected scientific hypothesis that were later proven to be true throughout a wide variety of scientific fields. There are nutjobs out there that actually believe The Day After Tomorrow is a fairly accurate portrayal of what global warming will do to the world. Also, it's pretty _conspicuous_ that many of these self professed ""scientists"" also work for these companies that sell eco-friendly products.

I don't know why I didn't receive a notification of your reply, but all of that's irrelevant to the Green New Deal anyway because it's classified as a ""non-binding resolution of values"" by AOC - the biggest fangirl of the bill that still blindly gives undying support.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-green-new-deal-cost-non-binding-resolution-of-values

Also, the measures are said to cost up to $93 trillion just for the first 10 years if the bill is followed to its fullest extent. Breaking this figure down into per American household, that number comes to $600,000. I don't know about you, but I don't have $600,000 lying under my sofa cushions to give out like it's nothing, so even if you save the trees with these overzealous policies, you're still going to wreck the American economy beyond repair and ruin the lives for hundreds of millions.

As Emily Cassidy and Dawn Undurraga at the Environmental Working Group point out, by weight, however, pork accounts for six times more greenhouse gas emissions than lettuce!"" 

The comparison is misleading. You'd need to eat 4 heads of lettuce to equal the 400 calories of bacon that was studied. Not to mention nobody is replacing bacon with lettuce when they go vegan. We're replacing it with beans, legumes, grains, mock meats, etc. ‚ÄúIt is absurd to compare the environmental impacts between bacon and lettuce when you‚Äôre using calories as the denominator,‚Äù Brent Kim, program officer for the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future‚Äôs Food Production and Public Health Program, told ThinkProgress. ‚ÄúA serving of lettuce has fewer calories than a stick of gum.‚Äù",2.0,1.0,,VR1UhhO4UYU,

He is trying to eviscerate President Obama's legacy and doesn't know anything about science. Also, the expenses for the wall he is trying to build is just going to leave America further in debt. Do you possibly think that paying 20 billion dollars for a wall that doesn't even cover the whole border is a good decision. Around 3 million of the undocumented immigrants just took a plane. Also, deportation is not the answer as that will cost more money to deport them than it would to let them stay. I personally believe that the U.S. should just try to make them citizens. The issue of the immigrants ""taking our jobs"" can be easily fixed if lazy Americans would work hard enough to keep their jobs. Also, Trump stating that climate change is fake through his actions shows you the lack of intelligence that President Trump currently has. Climate change is a very real and serious matter in which can be the end of humanity if we don't stop it. Trump has taken the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement which deals a significant blow to the fight against climate change.

It's a nearly unprecedented economic feat.¬† Sure, overall debt rose, but that's to be expected with a massive revenue hole left over before his term and you quickly saw deficits decline as he closed those holes. 

I could probably go on and on about the economic policies that I liked, especially the tax subsidies for R&D and education, which focused on long-term economic growth rather than short-term gains.¬† I also liked his reforms to reduce government waste, and his EO requiring CBA's to be submitted for nearly every major government policy and the results to be available to the public. There was a lot more transparency after that, and a lot of inefficiencies were fixed and waste eliminated (I've seen estimates of more than $3 billion in savings).¬† 

As for Obamacare, it's not ideal, but it's definitely better than what we had before.¬† As proof, medical bankruptcies are now half the rate they used to be.¬† Medical health cost inflation was halved as well. Some saw premiums go up, but for the vast majority, those premium increases were absorbed by subsidies.¬† And overall, costs are much lower for those who need it the most, i.e. the elderly, the disabled, and those with pre-existing conditions. 

I know this will get some flack from my friends on the left, but I don't actually agree with free healthcare (I think that the healthcare industry in the US would require huge reforms before it would be feasible and I don't see it happening).¬† I think the ACA would work a lot better with just a few substantial tweaks.¬† 

Now, Obama wasn't perfect.¬† For example, he failed to double manufacturing as promised... but in his defence, he increased it by a record amount, over 40% when manufacturing jobs had been declining for decades.¬†¬†But he didn't panic when many presidents would have, when faced with the same challenges.¬† He made a lot of right moves early on.¬† And he did it with aplomb, maintaining a ready wit and a graciousness to his detractors.¬† When the media reported something negative about him, he would reply, ""I don't always like what they say, but I'll defend their right to say it.""¬† That kind of attitude seems very impressive these days in comparison.",8.0,1.0,,VR1UhhO4UYU,

1.¬† Again, they didn't look at the amount of jobs that would be created by following the Paris Agreement, which would require a substantial boost in new infrastructure building and investment in R&D.¬† Renewables generally produce two to three times more jobs (using¬†conservative estimates) than¬†fossil fuel jobs.

2. The NERA study ignores that in real world studies and historically, increases in energy efficiency (as would result via the Paris Agreement) generates net savings for consumers.¬† As an example, while increased fuel efficiency standards may cost auto-manufacturers millions to implement, they generate billions in cost savings to consumers in the form of reduced fuel costs.¬† In the NERA study, increased efficiency is shown up as a net cost, when it should show up as a net benefit. 

3. The study did not account for the enormous costs of pollution and climate change.¬† While numbers vary, the IPCC suggests figures as high as 10% of global GDP.¬† The climate sceptic Cato Institute points out that economic losses caused by climate change primarily affects third-world nations in tropical regions¬†and¬†that¬†the USA should only experience a 1% drag on GDP.¬† Even taking Cato's numbers, a 1% loss of GDP per year is effectively higher than the costs of implementing the Paris Agreement.¬† Taking into effect health benefits from reducing emissions (which include more than CO2), then the net benefits are much higher.¬† 

4.¬†The figures as quoted from the study came from one of the more extreme scenarios, assuming that companies and countries would choose the most expensive options in order to meet Paris Agreement goals.¬† This is highly unrealistic, as most companies would choose the cheapest option, not the most expensive. This core scenario also assumes a 40% reduction in emissions in the industrial sector- which is not stated in the Paris Agreement- which grossly overstates the changes in outputs and jobs.¬† Out of four scenarios, why do media pundits pick the most extreme one?¬† The more realistic scenarios look at companies choosing the cheapest, most flexible options to meet reduction targets, which (not surprisingly) shows vastly lower costs and job losses. 

5. The NERA study does not account for innovation or technology change, assuming that costs remain flat and that the price of renewables will not fall.¬† This is extremely unrealistic and skews the projection; as an example, the price of solar has fallen by about 40% every 5-6 years (and 12% in the last year alone).¬† The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is predicting another 18% drop in costs in the next two years, with a further decrease expected every year after that. Yet the NERA study assumes that the price of¬†renewables remains¬†constant for the next 8 years.¬† 

6. Historically, in the past ten years we have reduced emissions by around 14% with no statistically discernable job losses or economic¬†loss.¬† It's unrealistic to believe that meeting a 26% reduction goal would have such potent negative effects when a 14% reduction had virtually no effect.¬† Especially as the Paris Agreement gave us the flexibility to meet our targets via any method we wished.¬† In addition, a study of the 9 states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative over the past 6 years showed a nearly 33% reduction in CO2, creating a net savings for consumers on their power bills of about $1.5 billion, creating a net of 22,000 jobs, and bringing net¬†economic benefits worth about $2.9 billion.¬† These states showed an exact opposite of NERA's predictions and they had higher emission caps than the ones proposed in the Paris Agreement.¬† In general, the NERA study does not account for past data.¬† http://www.nera.com/news-events/press-releases/2017/nera-economic-consultings-study-of-us-emissions-reduction-polici.html",6.0,1.0,,VR1UhhO4UYU,

I think we're looking at it from two perspectives. I'm looking at the economic boons while youre looking at how it's affecting us compared to China, and the long term goals.

its also important to note that all 50 states favored in remanding a part of the accord

951,UgithUE1p63YhngCoAEC,UgithUE1p63YhngCoAEC,2017-06-06T01:58:25Z,mitch paul,"1. Under the accord, the U.S. had a target of reducing its carbon emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. That alone would have resulted in ""extreme changes in energy use"" because ""even Mr. Obama‚Äôs bevy of anti-carbon regulations would get the U.S. to a mere 45% of its target,"" per The Wall Street Journal editorial board.

2. The accord would have required the countries involved to raise their carbon emission-cutting goals every five years. The Obama administration intended to eventually curb carbon emissions by 80%, essentially North Korea levels.

3. The accord is non-binding legally, but activist courts may have used it as a legal weapon. 

4. The accord doesn't hold China and India to a high standard. 
China and India offered benchmarks pegged to GDP growth, which means they can continue their current energy plans. China won‚Äôt even begin reducing emissions until 2030 and in the next five years it will use more coal. 

China also can't be trusted to reduce their carbon emissions since they have a history of misrepresenting their total emission levels.

5. The U.S. had pledged $3 billion a year to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund. Under the accord, participants would provide $100 billion to organizations like the Green Climate Fund to provide money to poorer countries to neutralize the costs of curtailing carbon emissions. The Obama administration has already funneled $1 billion to the organization without congressional approval as part of a $3 billion pledge.",8.0,1.0,,VR1UhhO4UYU,

The ice caps are apparently melting when they are at record thickness.

There is a very large glacier group that sits on top of a stretch of land near the South Pole, and it has been melting at an exponential rate. The difference between sea ice melting and land based glaciers melting is the difference between ice cubes in a glass of water and an ice cube stuck in the opening of a water bottle, not touching the water. When the water in the glass melts, the water level doesn't change, but as the ice cube on top of the bottle melts, the run off makes the water level in the bottle rise.",1.0,1.0,,VR1UhhO4UYU,

Yes, he encourages scepticism, but he provides factually incorrect reasons for his logic behind it. Stuff like how he says ""fossil fuels employs more people"" is statistically incorrect, solar energy alone employs over 2x more people than oil, coal and gas combined (the Forbes and pretty much any business/economic publisher has an article on it). His arguments are straw man and he fails to look at the other benefits to not using fossil fuels (e.g. the air pollution causing increased rates of asthma and emphysema (check any medical journal for more info)). Another argument he produces is that other scientists that aren't climate scientists agree that climate change is real but since it isn't their field they don't know anything. However, when you do the necessary learning to become a scientist, you learn ""the scientific method"". This allows any scientist to read hypotheses, conclusions and data from other scientists outside their own field and understand what they have discovered - also as a sidenote: if 98% of leading professionals in one field are saying something is true, it's just logical to believe them, just like the way you'd believe your dentists when 9/10 of them say which toothpaste works.

Man made climate change isn't a conspiracy, its individual effects can be recreated in lab environments and its effects are already devastating communities around the world.

Simple science: C02 gets built up in the atmosphere.  the suns rays has enough energy to penetrate the atmosphere, but less energy is being able to level the atmosphere due to the increase in C02. This causes an increase in temperature.  What happens to things when they get hotter?  They expand. First,  when the ice caps melt (and they are definitely melting) They'll expand and cause ocean levels to rise.  Second,  the water itself will expand due to the extra energy it will recieve from the heat. This will cause global flooding and massive fluctuations in whether patterns. The bleaching of the great barrier reef is a good example of climate change damaging the environment. But let's say you still don't believe in simple science that can be easily replicated. Well,  the other reason to stop poluting is that it causes health issues when it is in high enough doses,  looking at you China. Then there is the issue of us destroying all of our fresh water supplies.  Once enough water systems get destroyed,  the remaing water will become more valuable than oil due to it's scarcity and importance.  That's simple economics.  

Am I part of the problem?  Yes, I drive a car and do not use the most eco friendly means to survive.  However,  the point is to get everyone on the same page so we can chose to make green decisions.  if it was economically viable I'd definitely own a Tesla and power it with solar panels.  but until then,  the best we can do is inform people.",0.0,1.0,,VR1UhhO4UYU,

If you look at the per capita numbers they're at the middle of the pack - with less than half of the emissions per capita of the US.

What can be said is that they've been having a rather extreme upward trend in the last few decades, unlike most western nations, and far more steep in it's rise than a nation of comparable population such as India. I'd also be very careful about believing claims of Chinese emissions having peaked (it's been predicted before and been untrue), as economic factors are likely a far larger part of the story than altruism. Best case scenario would be them hitting a plateau, but it's unlikely that we'll see any drop-off soon. If the Chinese economy gets an upswing and more people aquire wealth (after all, despite the per capita numbers being important, a far smaller percentage of the Chinese population are responsible for the country's emissions than in western nations) it's unlikely that emissions will decrease, and even possible that they will increase.

However, being allowed to increase emissions is not the same as increasing emissions. Suggesting that the Paris agreement is worthless because of hypotheticals treating the agreement as though it existed in a vacuum is disingenuous. It's a part of a global effort. It's not THE global effort.

""We're filing in all swing states a demand that judges step in and preserve evidence to avoid it from being destroyed or spoiled by the intentional or reckless acts of executive officials,"" said Phill Kline, director of the Amistad Project, which has previously filed election litigation in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 

The report claims that the ""tabulation log for the forensic examination of the server for Antrim County from December 6, 2020 consists of 15,676 individual events, of which 10,667 or 68.05% of the events were recorded errors."" The Federal Election Commission allows a maximum error rate of just 0.0008 percent.

""The error rate detailed in this report has implications for every state where we have litigation, and it comes on a day when officials are blocking legislators from having their say about elections in their states,"" Kline said. ""This joins with other compelling evidence that the elections in these states cannot be certified under the law.""

Investigators believe the error rate in Antrim County is an intentional flaw built into the software in order to compel ""bulk adjudication"" of ballots by election officials ‚Äî a process that allows alteration of ballots with minimal or no meaningful oversight. Antrim County maintains records of the adjudication process for previous elections, but records for the 2020 election were either deleted or never entered, making it impossible to determine whether adjudicated ballots accurately reflected the intent of the voters.

The Michigan Bureau of Election also issued a memorandum on December 1 instructing election clerks that electronic poll book files must be deleted from all laptops and flash drives. The Amistad Project is asking judges in all swing states to issue emergency orders preventing state and local officials from destroying such evidence.

""In Michigan, the Secretary of State has ordered deletion of e-poll books and other evidence and also has taken affirmative steps to seal forensic evidence regarding the flaws in the operation of Dominion machines from both the public and from legislators who need access to this information in order to perform their constitutional duty,"" Kline said. ""This joins with the Michigan Attorney General threatening legislators with criminal investigation and possible prosecution if they disagree with her, and the Michigan Governor and other officials shutting down the peoples' house and preventing them from gathering today to perform their constitutional duty.""

Not a US resident? Look up the standard rearing/slaughtering methods of your country, it is most likely the same/even more brutal

According to the American dietetic association (consisting of 100,000 professionals in health and nutrition) we can thrive on a vegan diet... at evry stage of life... pregnancy, lactation &infancy... this is backed by the British dietetic association, the Canadian dietic association, as well as the NHS 
Furthermore the United Nation published a 40 page report titled Livestock's Long Shadow detailing every envionmental issue we face as a result of animal agriculture.... the list is extensive everything from global warming, climate change, water pollution, resource depletion, antibiotics resistance, deforestation (to make room for feed crops) leading to habitat loss and species extinction at an unprecedented rate... and so on

Still insist we have valid reasons for meat consumption? Look up ""earthling ed ted talk every argument against veganism"" he will debunk all the best points waged against vegans

Finally, I have to add because people seem oblivious to the cruelty of dairy and eggs. Vegetarians please make the connection. Search this up ""why aren't vegans just vegetarian earthling ed""
***If you believe in this cause, please become an activist... the animals dont have a voice... please be their voice****

If you're a U.S resident look up ""earthlings documentary""
If you're in UK - look up ""land of hope and glory earthling ed""
If youre in Australia look up ""dominion documentary""

Yes. He would be the oldest president in history at his inauguration, at age 78. Mr. Trump, who is currently 74, would also be the oldest president ever if he wins a second term.

2. Where is Joe Biden from?
Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and moved to Delaware as a child. As a politician, he has maintained close political ties to both states, though Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of having ‚Äúdeserted‚Äù Pennsylvania.

‚ÄúI was in third grade,‚Äù Mr. Biden shot back.

He continues to maintain strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground that Mr. Trump won in 2016, and he has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia.

3. What role does the Obama era play in Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign?
A big one. Mr. Obama did not endorse Mr. Biden until the primary race was settled, but he and Mr. Biden forged a close relationship in his administration. Mr. Biden talks about their friendship frequently, as well as the work they did together on issues ranging from health care to foreign policy.

Throughout the primary, some of Mr. Biden‚Äôs biggest applause at campaign events came as he praised Mr. Obama. And many Democratic voters, especially African-American voters, have cited his relationship with Mr. Obama and nostalgia for that administration in explaining their current support for Mr. Biden. Now that the primary is over, Mr. Biden is also focused on winning the enthusiastic support of Democrats who supported other candidates and are lukewarm toward his candidacy ‚Äî and his campaign must also think about engaging independent voters and moderate Republicans.",3.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, he has looked for ways to help voters picture him as commander in chief, formulating recommendations rooted in advice from health care and economics experts. Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump‚Äôs response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.

Mr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. It‚Äôs an issue he often discusses in the context of his family‚Äôs personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes ‚ÄúMedicare for all,‚Äù the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.

Mr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don‚Äôt see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending America‚Äôs role as a leader on the global stage.",1.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

Many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.
This is a bit convincing, but not correct.
The exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth.
Therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"".

""GREEN NEW DEAL"" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. 
The biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. 
Therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. 
This is a fundamental problem.
Also, waste is another problem. 
Waste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.

Although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.
Trump should publicize the effects of ""One trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.

Why is ""One trillion trees"" so effective?
First of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. 
forests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.

In addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.
Photosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.
It absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.
One trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. 
The reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide.

climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate
poverty, including by:
(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below
2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would
significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; 

(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate
change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions
development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and
(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low
greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

This is false because, first, 95 percent of the greenhouse gas effect in Earth's atmosphere is caused by water vapor. 1/3rd of the remaining 5 percent is CO2 gas. 3 percent of this is man's total contribution since 1850 accounting for an estimated 0.1 percent of the greenhouse gas effect.

Second, 95 percent of the narrow band of infrared radiation available for CO2 to emmit is doing so already. So doubling CO2 would make no measurable difference.

Third, changes in the appearance of atmospheric CO2 gas occur at least 800 years AFTER changes in temperature. CO2 is an effect, not a cause.

Since the peak of the Little Ice Age 350 years ago, the global mean surface temperature has been rising at a rate of 0.8C/century and, to this day, hasn't deviated by more than 1.5 percent from the mean.

According to the vast majority of climate experts, the only reasonable cause for this recent warming is the drastic increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration that happened over the same period of time. Other causes such as changes in ocean currents, solar activity or cosmic rays have been considered thoroughly, and they simply don't correlate with the recent rise in global temperature and can therefore be excluded as the main cause.

Assume I am driving car for 10 hours continuously without any break with different speed. So first 7 hours, I drive at varying speeds not exceeding 50 miles/hr and then in last 3 hours, I increase my speed by 1.5 times after each hour. 
So, assume I am at 50 miles/hr at end of 7 hours. So after eighth hour, I am at (50*1.5=75 miles/hr) and after ninth hour, I am at (75*1.5=112.5 miles/hr) and finally at the end of tenth hour, my speed is (112.5*1.5=168.75 miles/hr).

So as per your logic, I will say my increase in speed per hour was: (168.75 - 0.0)/10 = 16.875 miles/hour. BUT THAT IS WRONG.

In reality, I was slow and did not exceed 50 miles/hr for first 7 hours and then I ACCELERATED ONLY IN LAST 3 HOURS. 

So my average increase in speed per hour WILL GIVE ME FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I DID NOT ACCELERATE IN THE END AND 16.875 miles/hr is pretty decent increase in speed for 10 hour journey.  

By the way, I am not alarmist. Climate change is not like one day you get up and we all die. Climate change affects subtly. For example, in coming years, there will be increased number of floods, droughts, frequent and stronger hurricanes and so on.  I never meant to say that climate change will hit you suddenly like a nuclear bomb. It is slow and continuously damaging in several ways. Not to mention that agriculture will suffer a lot due to seasonal variations.

It looks like they may have focused too much on one single metric like CO2 emissions per capita, ranked counties by that metric and reported that as the be all end all for climate involvement. In particular mentioning India as a near successful country sounds very misleading to me. Compared to counties of it's size like China and the US it's CO2 emissions per capita might be very low due to India's large population yet relative poverty compared to the US, but their CO2 emissions have been steadily increasing and still nearly 60% of India's energy comes from coal. Considering India's current economical situation it does not look like it is set up to slow down let alone reverse it's carbon emissions any time soon.

Instead of putting all your faith into a snapshot of one single metric, take a look at what's been happening over the last decade or two. Then counties like Norway - with their focus on solar and hydro power - and France - with their impressive focus on nuclear power - show that they have reduced and are capable of further reducing their emissions.",0.0,0.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Already in the second sentence is a mistake. Carbon is not equal carbondioxide. Or would you say hydrogen is equal to water?  It is therefore also overly stupid to measure a gas in tons. Real scientists measure CO2 in the atmosphere in ppm.
In order to explain warming by CO2 they invented the theory the radiative forcing. But there is the same problem with it, like with unicorns. Everybody knows how to describe it, but nobody has ever seen one.
Besides, there is another mistery. The CO2 is still increasing, despite half of the world is in corona lockdown since 6 months.

Vegan companies are thriving and the milk industry would be dead already if not for the substantial subsidies they receive from government... Meat would also be very expensive if they weren't heavily subsidised. You're right in the sense that some people will never go vegan willingly, but social pressure will definitely do it... and if not then at some point down the line laws will do it. The world is much better off without animal agriculture, for many reasons other than animal rights, many human rights issues too... it's all bunched together for me now, though initially i changed due to environmental issues. 

Look you seem like an intelligent person, I appreciate the animal rights aren't going to do it but I suggest you look into all the different areas where animal agriculture is causing harm. Once (if) you change then you wont need cognitive dissonance or an appeal to futility, and once that's out of the way you may see the true injustice and unnecessary suffering we cause to these animals. Question, do you have a dog or cat? maybe I can use pets as an example? 
But basically you don't need to love animals to be vegan, just recognise that their life is worth more than your momentary sensory pleasure. I mean given the choice to slit a cows throat yourself for a burger or eat a vegan curry I'm sure I know which one you would honestly choose.

In terms of the gun analogy... its better. However you are talking to the wrong person because I live in Portugal and no one here has guns. No one in Europe has guns. In fact its crazy to people here that that's actually allowed in the US. Aren't there many people against gun ownership though? I mean I'm sure there's many people without guns, and from what i'm seeing there's more pressure than ever to get rid of guns right? The government won't do it unless there's social pressure but that day may very well come... and in my opinion the US will be much better off...

Most likely, I suspect, there are some people who are suggestible to veganism, they need encouragement from others to make that jump but ultimately they were always predisposed to that sort of decision. The sort of word-of-mouth approach you suggest may reach say, ten to twenty percent of westerners, but I'm not sure that's really enough. If you really want a meat-free world, it would have to come from the top down, not the bottom up.

(I also note that you seem to have lapsed from making an environmental case at this point to being solely one over animal rights, which confirms my thoughts that you would have gone vegan anyway and the environmental factors are simply a side issue. Personally, I'm not too fussed over animal rights, it's just never been a high priority for me, humans are simply doing a more sophisticated version of what every apex predator before them did. This is obviously something we aren't ever going to agree on, because it is a fundamental difference in values.)

In terms of the teaching analogy, yes, I understand it is flawed. I'll give you that one. How about a better analogy - gun control in the US. Yes, gun owners could be more responsible. They could even decide to get rid of their guns voluntarily. But they just aren't going to. Whenever there is a mass shooting in the US, people blame the easy availability of lethal weapons - and they are completely right to look at government inaction rather than the individual perpetrator. I believe meat consumption (to the extent that it is polluting in a way that affects humans) is in a similar category to gun ownership.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

In order to change government (which i think is something we should do obviously) you need a large enough following. Every individual counts.  The teacher example doesnt work because you are not directly sabotaging the educational system, are you? where as by eating meat you are directly causing harm. A better example:

Every teacher uses violence on kids and it's normalised in society, you want to change the system so teachers don't hit kids whilst you are currently beating a child.

Using an inexpensive thermoelectric device, they‚Äôre able to harness the cold of space without an active heat input. The process, called radiative sky cooling, can generate enough electricity to power an LED light. Think of it as similar to solar panels, except using the change in the night temperature for power rather than the sun.

The sun is getting hotter at a rate of about 0.5% per decade. That may not sound like a lot, but calculate it using the temperature of the sun and you'll see it's a significant amount compared to earth. This is from NASA's website and they themselves say this could cause climate change. I can't help you if you don't believe this.

And both mine and your links about the windmills use math, so neither are wrong. The methods for calculating are what matter. If you expect a windmill to last 10 years it would make back it's carbon footprint, but I don't expect them to last longer than 3 years.

We have until 2030 to end fossil emissions entirely.

It's also better than the video implies. Lynchpin nations punch above their weight contributing to fossil emissions through export, import and trade. Get these handful of nations to scale back to zero fossil emissions and fossil trade and they can reduce world fossil emissions in half, and they can do it unilaterally. More, they can start a virtuous cycle of swapping fossil for renewable as the technology improves and fossil free prices come down through economies of scale.


Start with Canada, responsible for 14% of global fossil emissions despite its tiny 1.6% of domestic direct emissions; get rid of Canada's bitumen extraction, and 7% of the world's fossil emissions disappear. Will other suppliers step in to fill the void of the world's 4th largest fossil exporter? They may, but they'll drive the price up as supplies are constrained 5%, taking the world back to 2015 prices. 2015 oil prices can't compete with 2021 solar prices, or wind or geothermal; conventional 2015 cars can't compete with 2021 electric vehicles. For the rest, Canada needs to stop exporting coal, which will also end US coal exports as US ports won't handle the stuff, and Canada is only obliged to ship American coal if it ships Canadian coal. That leaves Canada's fossil-intensive imports, which it can over the next decade drop to zero; Canada's already 82% fossil free on its electricity grids and has plenty of expertise for Hybrit steel and Elysis aluminum, basalt fiber, geopolymer cement, even biochar production to displace carbon in silicon fabrication.

Move to Australia, infamous for its coal exports. Anything Canada can do, Australia can do standing on its head.

Go through the list of key fossil emission contributors and you'll find more than enough muscle in just a few nations -- enough to skip over the usual suspects like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, Russia, China and India -- and get it done.

Cap relative to 2019 levels fossil emitting trade and extraction at 90% in 2021, 80% in 2022, 70% in 2023 down to 0% in 2030 and the Market will rush to invest in fossil free innovation. Lead the target to hit the target.

One of the main things is that their energy output is very low compared to their production cost. Future is not in renewable sources of energy, they are simply not enough to support our civilization on energetic level that it needs. (until you build a solar panel Dyson swarm of course :D)
But at the moment, nuclear energy is the best possible source of energy that we have in our hands. There are no emissions, much less people die in accidents compared to other kinds of plants, etc.. And if you want to mention Chernobyl, then do not forget that that was fault of the poor maintenance of the soviets. Also, there are no emissions from nuclear power plants. Only thing that you need is to store the waste and if you do not dump it into the lake or somewhere similar, then you're pretty much alright.

There's no action, just laziness, I wouldn't say on the part of the speakers, but of the platform itself. It also represents a certain attitude towards the issues on our planet, an attitude that says we can solve it all by talking about it and spreading our ideas. Unfortunately, that is much too slow to respond and adapt to this never-ending technological revolution. It's kind of like a rich person's pastime, where we all talk about how we're so much more advanced and our ideas are amazing, yet when it comes to it, all that it is is a pastime. It's much more comfortable to sit in a chair and listen to someone speak, then to go out and commit your entire life to the fixing of our world. That, however, is exactly what we need in order to win in the battle against ourselves. Then again, I suppose TED is pretty much powerless to do anything... well... you could talk about controversial subjects that will end up angering either the US, China, Russia, or the EU, but we all know that will never happen. Everyone's stuck in this seemingly endless cycle, one where we're arguing for the sake of arguing, following rules that we didn't have a hand in creating, rules that evolution instinctually gave to us. But we never question them. Society tells us to jump and we do so without any notion of doing otherwise. Honestly, climate change isn't an issue. What we really need to change is how we view life itself. For there is no reason to covet wealth or power but the words of those with wealth and power. Why haven't we stopped to think for once, and realized that all those in power want you to do is to work for them. There no benefits for yourself but a life slaving away for someone who views you as a number on a page. Go against the grain, stop listening to the rich people telling you what to think, what to learn, and what to do. If you want to live a good life it really is as simple(yet difficult) as that.

Although I'm sure you've heard all the arguments already, so there's no point in me repeating them so you can ignore them. 

I think biofuels are bullshit too and obviously food poverty is a real, important thing. But the problem is waste (only half of all food produced in the US is consumed) and the intensive agricultural techniques that are degrading the soil, which is being exacerbated by the growing demand for animal products.

In my last comment I meant pollutants which are green house gases - with CO2 being the main one, although there are also others, sorry for not clarifying that. The Scotese + Berner studies are used quite a lot in climate denialism, but they simplify climate science. We know that things were different in the past and in the paleozoic era the solar output was a lot lower, so the high CO2 levels helped the planet maintain a stable climate.

With regard to climate change, I don't really see why small businesses would be hit harder than big businesses because any tax levied would presumably scale with turnover, and the big businesses would therefore pay more. Let's say you have two haulage firms, A and B. A has ten times as many lorries as B, it has ten times the turnover and makes ten times the profit. Its lorry fleet covers ten times the distance of B's, so it's also using ten times as much carbon as B, and it would have to pay ten times as much in carbon taxes - the same proportion of its profits.

First and foremost, that'd be overpopulation, which leads to excess deforestation. Then the most obvious one is industrialization. The next one would be more and more people buying private vehicles which wasn't the case, say about 100 years back. So I don't think you would argue with THAT. Vehicle exhaust is one of the top reasons of poor quality air in developing and developed countries. All of these factors add up and that leads to dramatic CO2 rise. And these are ALL anthropogenic (man made) factors. There's that about rising CO2 level.
Now about *why* ? Its just basic chemistry. The molecules of greenhouse gases have very good heat trapping capabilities. G.g. molecules can absorb energy from infrared (IR) radiations, basically photons(packets of energy) & energy from the photon causes the CO2¬†molecule to vibrate. Some time later, the molecule gives up this extra energy by emitting another infrared photon. Once the extra energy has been removed by the emitted photon, the carbon dioxide molecule stops vibrating. Molecules are constantly in motion, colliding with other gas molecules and transferring energy from one molecule to another during collisions. In the more-complex, real-world process, a¬†CO2¬†molecule would most likely bump into several other gas molecules before re-emitting the infrared photon. The¬†CO2¬†molecule might transfer the energy it gained from the absorbed photon to another molecule, adding speed to that molecule's motion. Since the temperature of a gas is a measure of the speed of the molecules in the gas, the faster motion of a molecule that eventually results from the IR photon that was absorbed by a¬†CO2¬†molecule raises the temperature of the gases in the atmosphere.

This ability to absorb and re-emit infrared energy is what makes CO2¬†an effective heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Not all gas molecules are able to absorb IR radiation. For example,¬†nitrogen¬†(N2) and¬†oxygen¬†(O2), which make up more than 90% of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb infrared photons. CO2¬†molecules¬†can vibrate in ways¬†that simpler nitrogen and oxygen molecules cannot, which allows CO2¬†molecules to capture the IR photons. Greenhouse gases and the¬†greenhouse effect¬†play an important role in Earth's climate. Without greenhouse gases, our planet would be a¬†frozen ball of ice. In recent years, however, excess emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities (mostly burning fossil fuels) have begun to warm Earth's climate at a problematic rate. Other significant greenhouse gases include water vapor (H2O),¬†methane¬†(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and¬†ozone¬†(O3).

It's a heavy handed opinion video which cherry picks and then proceeds to misrepresent data. There's not even a whole lot to argue against there. It's just deceptive and surface level, and I think anyone who isn't trying to just reaffirm their opinions would see that.

Also, what point in our Earth's past? Our Eart has gone through several climate cycles, all of which had an underlying cause, such as atmospheric composition, mind you. There were points in time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth where, yes average CO2 was higher (not sure about ten times higher but whatever), but so was average global temperatures and sea levels.

What weather events? Hurricanes, tropical storms, wildfires, volcanic activity? You gotta specify. Regardless, the climate doesn't stop certain things from happening. The most severe hurricane could've happened ten thousand years ago but that wouldn't change anything. It's the increase in average severity that matters.

As far as your last remark, I really don't understand what you mean by any of that. Genuine question, is English your native language? No insult there if it's not. You're doing a good enough job at speaking it that I have to ask, and I can only speak one language, so good on you. However, there are some confusing word choices and grammatical and structural decisions here and there that are making things a bit harder to understand at times.

Though, quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm too interested in keeping engaged with this. There isn't much of a discussion happening here, if I'm being brutally honest. I say things, you shrug them off and reply with loosely related things that either aren't really arguments or are based off of bad data, like a YouTube video that wouldn't hold up to any sort of scientific scrutiny, or subjective perceptions and morals, or both. I'm trying my best here to keep an open mind in the exchange of knowledge and ideas, but it seems you're more interested in being right or ""pwning the climate commies"" or whatever then trying to enhance your understanding of a topic while sharpening your mind. For that reason, this isn't a discussion or an argument or any of that. It's a dumb stupid fight, the online discourse version of mud wrestling, and I don't participate in such things. Shame that most discourse seems to go that way.",1.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Saying carbon dioxide is a fundamental product of life, while technically true, is deceptive wording. Carbon dioxide is literally a biological waste product. You exhale to excrete it. Feces and urine are also fundamental products of life by that logic, yet I don't think you're going to argue against plumbing.

If we're gonna talk about what is and isn't natural, keep in mind that oil and coal was buried by nature before we decided to dig it up and burn it. Nature decided to keep that stuff in the ground, not us. Who are we to go against it?",1.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Before America was a super rich country and we certainly could afford to contribute or help more, or just give out more to help the world out.  However, nowadays, America's generosity made America no longer rich and even has much problems to continue to maintain the social security benefits much longer, although hard working Americans paid much out for their security benefits.  I guess this is why too many Americans are mad, angry and become emotional for changes of the security and safety, prosperity and unity as well as to lead and govern by America's own rules of the laws for America's own greatness.  I believe that since America is an independent Capitalism system country, absolutely it has the full right either to join any world organization or withdraw from any organization as well as any other countries in the world too.  Right or not, none of us will be able to say or predict, because we are only humans.  However, only the results will be able to to prove,  indicate.

Have any of you ever looked at the climate models or ICC reports yourself?
They are all misrepresented and bias towards Global warmings mass funding and hype.

ICC reports are often written by people who are not even scientists.
Any academics who dispute the models or reports by the ICC are labeled as mad and unrealistic.

What I seem to understand at this time is simply this: the majority left says that the vast majority of scientists on the topic will agree that the climate is changing.  

-The right will contend hence that science is not a popularity vote (and that big money government backing only affords those who agree with their beliefs on Climate Change, thus creating a foundation of bias in the scientific community - very unscientific indeed) with the added statement that THEY TOO agree the climate is changing in that CO2 is rising, making the globe warmer, but that it was happening long before man came on the scene with the Industrial Revolution and since.  They will also add that we simply don't know whether there is a significant correlation between the wrongs man has done and the kinds of affects that we associate with CO2 rising.  

-From what I can gather the left will then perhaps try to make the claim that it doesn't matter right now if we know these things or not; let's play it safe and do all we can now before we face possible appocolyptic catastrophes by making stringent regulations on the major things we know contribute to increased CO2 levels.  

-The right responds with the rationale of we don't know if our basis for these propositions is even correct, so why spend so much money and time on what we know can only at best change the global environment over the course of a hundred years to an infinitesimal degree.  One so small it would have no real effect on the things we care about for why we are doing this to begin with, and with that - at a cost that could have potentially been spent on needs that we both DID KNOW were real issues AND could have an enormous positive effect to the degree we all would hope for.  

With all this the right again would like to add that CO2 happens to be what essentially all plants around the world breath.  Therefore, how could this be as harmful as they say.  If the effects by the way, did happen, the left agrees it would still take a century more or so before we see any of the kind of catastrophic incidents like we see in the movies.",0.0,0.0,,eIJ_sxzUZuI,

Behind this agenda are Eco-Marxists and anarchists that hate America, hate the West, hate capitalism as well as the economic successes of Western nations compared to grossly corrupt, mismanaged nations in much of the Third World (despots embezzling their countries dry, making bad business decisions based on kickbacks received that did not benefit their nations' economies and citizens, etc.). 

So, President Trump was right to withdraw America from the Paris Climate Accord since the accord accomplishes nothing, has no teeth and is non-binding, and it allows China and India, etc. to keep on polluting as usual while the West has already reduced pollution emissions, sought out ""green"" energy alternatives (that are costly and problematic and have negatively impacted various economies), and enacted various health, safety, and environmental standards that are virtually non-existent in much of the Third World, the Middle East, etc.

""The climate accord signers hurt millions of people, they never have to meet"" Everyone signed it except for two nations, Syria, they are currently just a little busy with other things and Nicaragua, because they said it is not harsh enough. The whole world signed it, even China, even North Korea. So that statement is just wrong. Who also supports it: The whole worlds energy sector. Not only ExxonMobil and Shell, also Arch Coal and Peabody Energy, two major US coal companies. Why? Because it would provide more wealth to the industry and more jobs in america and worldwide. It might save jobs in the coal industry and keep companies alive (read the statements of these companies to understand why).
Even if you do not at all believe in man made climate change, job creation and wealth alone should be reason enough to stick with it.

If you divert money to a completely pointless cause you are inevitably ignoring other issues which could be solved with those *limited* resources. _(note the limited - basic economics - cost of opportunity).

First and last off, the Paris Agreement is based on self determined contributions.
Yes, *SELF DETERMINED* contributions.

That will never work. Never in the history of never _(If you'd like to know why just google why socialism doesn't work in the long run)_

Like every contract, the key is on the deadlines. A contract without deadlines is nothing. It's like WinRAR's free-trial, ignored.

The only way you'd make a valid deal about climate change would be setting actual deadlines, say, if X country doesn't lower it's pollution to f(X) by X=Xo then none of the members of this agreement will trade with it, at all.
If the country doesn't agree, then it will force itself into commercial shutdown. So they have to agree, and if they agree and don't even try to fulfill their goal, same consequence.

""Europe and U.S have way more better technology and renewables than india and china."" Agreed.

Talk about something that matters; our education systems are not for smart or useful people and ironically (put 1+1 together) it's cluttered with Democratic liberals. I can say this as a holder of multiple degrees in relevant computer and engineering fields. The metric of Democrats controlling colleges makes complete sense to me from a personal experience and logical perspective because let's be honest, it's a failed system that takes money from peasants to 'learn' about nothing. It's like putting bait out for stupid people, and then check the similarities between people who took the bait and it's all braindead democrats and their slaves. The only useful thing that carried on from historical colleges is the accreditation to say that you are capable of being a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer, but the other 80% of garbage is mainly what the vast majority of liberal Democrat children *freely choose* to major in anyway when given a choice between 'challenging with good reward' vs 'no challenge and no reward'. Almost all the med-school or engineer students I ever encountered were either moderate or republican because they are mature individuals. Conservatives who even make it to college are more incentivized to actually major in an important field which requires learning, concentration, or creates useful skills for themselves. 

So even by analyzing ""education"" (or rather the metric of graduating from a college with a degree), more liberals  spend longer times in colleges(proving they are stupid) and even dominate the worthless majors (proving they are even more stupid) and the smaller pools or percentages who go on to be successful after studying and enhancing themselves at relevant/challenging concepts tend to be Republicans or those who don't care about politics anyway.

Global climate models aren‚Äôt given nearly enough credit for their accurate global temperature change projections. As the 2014 IPCC report showed, observed global surface temperature changes have been within the range of climate model simulations.

Now a new study shows that the models were even more accurate than previously thought. In previous evaluations like the one done by the IPCC, climate model simulations of global surface air temperature were compared to global surface temperature observational records like HadCRUT4. However, over the oceans, HadCRUT4 uses sea surface temperatures rather than air temperatures.",1.0,1.0,,eIJ_sxzUZuI,

If private industry can come up with innovations that cost nearly as much or less than the current conveniences the customers already enjoy, the new things sell. 

The government has a long history of trying to help innovation along (look into steam boats and the trans continental rail road. talk about a turd sandwich there) and doing an awful job. 

this is the same bunch of people who invest in million dollar turtle tunnels under a road. or studies about how well Chinese hookers handle their liquor, in china (yup, those are real government projects and studies. The list of crap the government wastes money on is egregious). 

I'm not saying some of these should be invested in. I'm pretty sure Solar roads, if there is ever a chance of it actually becoming a thing is going to require the government coughing up some serious dough to make it happen. The benefits would be staggering. They put heating elements in the road so no ice or snow will stick. LED's and pressure sensors so the road can warn drivers of animals in the road (or people) inductive plates so electric cars can charge while driving. Fiber optics run to allow for near instantaneous communications along the road, to allow for load switching with the added bonus of every single place in the US connected through a web network to everyplace else via Fiber. Talk about an increase in internet connectivity. The benefits to the people are massive...and so will the price tag. Not even counting the electrical benefit. would theoretically eliminate the need for all but a small number of power plants. (no more coal burning). If more and more people switched to electric cars, as long as they drive on solar roads they'd stay mostly charged and could go for longer and farther. With the pressure sensors and fiber I could see self driving electric cars controlled by a central traffic computers in major cities. Almost no gas powered vehicles anymore. 

you want to make the US almost a negative carbon footprint? push for solar roads. 

Problem is, there's not huge wads of cash to be wedged into back pockets as easily with solar roads. If the government just make up stupid laws and taxes to squeeze more money out of us, that's a LOT easier and quicker.

Money to research and information gathering as well as environmental cleaning and pollution reduction is also needed. The parts of the economy that is less inhabitated by private companies needs money too. Im not saying Obama is doing the right thing by giving out a bag of money but for sure there has to be both companies and institutions who needs more funding or else we would all be emmision free in no time. Money and competition is by far the best motivators or factors when it comes to innovation after all. Also there needs to be more funding to stop deforestation, more water cleaning, less air pollution and work on other environmental issues is a good thing if you ask me.¬†
Yes the strategy about picking the winners is overall a short-term good investment and is mostly supported when the government is involved. I dont think if we let global warming go on as it is right now, even with all these new forms of technology, will be enough. We need agreements and legislations when it comes to our emmisions.

there's a company called HyperSolar that's developed a method of cleaning polluted water by breaking the bonds in the water using solar power to extract hydrogen and in the process cleans the water.

graphene is incredible and when it's commercially available it's going to make batteries that can be charged in nothing flat and hold a charge like none other. used in manufacturing computer chips they can reduce the size by a factor and it has a conductivity factor that is nearly as good if not better than gold. oh, and when it is used up or is no longer working? it's carbon. about as environmentally friendly as you can get. 

there's some new technology going into making new solar cells that are a LOT better than what's currently available and are cheaper. if that tech is combined with solar roads the electric grid in the US will become solid as a rock and cheap to boot. 

all this...every bit of it. ALL of it is being done by private industry using capitalism as an innovation tool to push the technology to it's limits by creating things better, faster and cheaper. Some are getting subsidies, but very few of them and what they're getting is less than what the government is subsidizing oil companies. 

this is all great, but when the government starts creating legislation to push this agenda of ""steal from those that have and give to those they feel today they want to give money to"". It's the opposite of helpful. it stops innovation. It prevents people from creating new and better things.

Countries in Africa, island countries and close to water level countries are the ones getting affected the most. Yesterday i saw a outdoor solar powered lamp i could buy for like a dollar. In Sweden they made a building material that is almost transparent so you can put solarcells behind it making it highly efficient and robust in areas with harsh weather. In Denmark they are producing some of the best windpower turbines and is sharing technology with developing countries to diversify their industry. Even a company like Google is making sustainability reports and trying to give its company a greener image. Greenland was mentioned in this video and do you know how they want to become more independent from Denmark? They want to give out rights to search for oil in the arctic area and mine its rich natural ressources.

The US were the worst at 5 and India fared the best at 0.4. Yet India are included on their diagram making me question the method they use. China which they aligned with the US in this video stands at 1 planet. China and India have massive populations skewing things enourmously.
There are many European countries which were not highlighted despite being extremely unsustainable possibly due to lower popupations. My own country of Ireland is a great example. We have a horrific system where nobody cares about the environment. We are probably around the UK yet we are not on the diagram probably because we only have a population of 4.5m.
Brazil, to my knowledge, has a large population likely skewing things. I do not know how Brazil is eco-wise though.

I finally thought that a Ted speech on climate change would give me an understanding about climate change. but all I got out of it is a woman with a sales pitch explaining how she came about creating her sales plan for climate change. After watching the video I still don't understand climate change. I don't know how and becomes a problem of completion with only two Nations out of 190 that are not in it is a problem. Why can't 188 Nations do it without the other two Nations. why does it take two more Nations to get this this rolling. It seems to be that it's not about how many nations join the climate Accord. It seems to me that this whole idea needs an investor and someone to be the sucker and implement the money for the whole project. As I try to learn more about this it seems to me like a pyramid scam where they take from one rich country and give to one poor country. Well Joe Biden is president now and he will sign the Paris Accord so I guess it will start rolling I just wonder how much more money America will borrow from European bankers to make this happen and at the end the American taxpayers will foot the bill. This is what America gets for bailing out Europe and sacrificing all the young men soldiers that died for Europe when the Nazis were going to take it all.

Rich people feel guilty for their life-style so EVERYBODY has to pay. The irony is that we think we can solve this with pumping money into this. Where is it going to end up? Meanwhile money is still an abstract thing and doesn't bring us any closer to nature. It's still personal choices of people whether they fly 10 times per year or don't want any green plant or tree in their garden. Can't force global population to pay for that. They say it's for investments in Bangladesh etc, but they have problems with water management, and lack of leadership in this, not just with climate. If you really believe that our actions increase temperature, we should live more simple, substract things, not add things. No money is needed for that. And why spend billions if of a lot of people don't even have their basic needs met? Which more has to do with power, powerlessness, oppurtunities, right investments at the right places etc. There should be investments made in projects that help women in third world countries out of their powerlessness, so they will give birth to the amount of children which their community can actually support, etc. The power of money only works if it's spend with a purpose and with integrity.

does the word PETRO DOLLAR mean anything to anyone who actually benefits from it? from there echoes an old idea we Americans used to see as having real significance in the business/political landscape, and that idea was commonly referred to as ""conflict of interests."" our government is two-faced. it claims to want to lead the world on climate action, yet in reality blocks any movement in that direction, both at home and abroad because our entire economic well being depends on the petro industry expanding until there is no more oil, and then, as obama says, the united states will move into a carbon reduced future. thats what he really means.",0.0,0.0,,MIA_1xQc7x8,

REGARDLESS of whether you believe in climate change, renewable resources and lifestyles give people self-sufficiency and a degree of independence and security from the government and these corporations. Particularly in Australia for many living in remote communities we NEED renewable resources, not only so people can more easily access food, power and water, but so they don't choke under the extreme costs for access to these basic needs (which, hey, are only going to increase when these resources become more scarce).

The human population exploding is actually a sign that the human race is able to survive exceptionally well (due to fossil fuel use). There are many secondary problems that come from having an exploding population, one which submits to a central authority that cannot cope with the increased bureaucratic demands. However, the population increase is not the problem itself, it is actually a good sign.

Chlorophyll production measured by satellites is actually increasing due to CO2. However, plant life and trees are dying in certain locales due to acidic rain caused by an output of SO2 and many other toxic wastes output by industry. Waters are polluted by chemical run-off and this affects our food chain directly. This is what needs to be addressed, not the increase in CO2. This is yet another fallacy that people buy into when thinking that the planet is dying - they focus on the CO2 and forget about the rest of the problems, hoping that somehow industry will be shut down by Carbon taxation and all the rest of the problems will cease. It doesn't happen like that. We need energy and resources to maintain our population, so attacking CO2 output will not solve any of the toxic waste issues we have.",1.0,1.0,,MIA_1xQc7x8,

Do you seriously think that anyone was waiting for the tobacco industry to tell them cigarettes were harmful? The medical community knew that in the 19th century. Why do you think they were called ""coffin nails"" during WW1? Why did Mark Twain write about the hazards of smoking?

""Lead Paint industry lobby""? The toxicity of lead paint was know 1000 years ago. Was the supposed _lead paint industry lobby_ a medieval trade guild?

So that's why you think Big Oil propaganda is the cause of ""denial."" No, data is the cause. And BTW, no one denies climate change. Only a minority of climate scientists are convinced it is primarily man made.

I didn't believe that human's are responsible for changing the climate so dramatically either, but then I saw it for myself.

Nobody needs to tell you what to believe, you need to find out what to believe.

And I put my money on the people that told us that Lead in paint products is bad, despite what the Lead Paint industry lobby said, or the scientists and doctors that bravely confronted the Big Tobacco lobby, and their lies that smoking is supposedly actually good for you.

Its nothing new, it has happened for as long as government influence and direction became as tradeable as a stock option.

I don't buy this whole propaganda bullshit, my people bought into it 83 years ago, and it ended up in the deaths of millions.

So the first thing I do is to do some research on the data and the people that proclaim said data, and what their motives are, what their research methods where, and who is paying them and possibly influencing their message.

You cannot argue with the truth, you can deny it, you can smear it, you can do whatever it is you think will plug up the hole, but sooner or later it will prevail.

Fewer and fewer people believe the lies and misinformation the Big Coal and Big Oil lobby funds people to say.

So George, maybe you will call me names. Maybe you will continue with the petty comparisons I started out with because I simply thought the debate has got to be over by now.

But I really sincerely hope not.

I would rather have people who are still in denial step aside and let us save the planet, but honestly we can't do it unless everyone is on board with us.

I am saying a proper debate on facts and figures should happen. None of such has occured ever since Algore became VP. You say the topics i bring up are easily debunked? The Medieval Warm periods itself is a heavily debated topic and you want to use that against me. There are scientist that say it is a global phenomenal. 

Every climatologist and Atmospheric Scientist knows that Water Vapour feedbacks are the main causes of increases in temperatures. Even the Scientific supporters of Man-Made Global Warming will tell you that. You clearly have not done your research. That water vapor feedback is the main part of the issue and where maybe, a debate should occur. Supporters say the feedback is 3 times. when skeptics say it is maybe less than 1 time as shown in the past few decades. As if it was 3 times, the ice caps at the poles would have melted and the temperature patterns wouldnt have been so normal.

That is why even the IPCC cant predict future Climate patterns when they pretend they can as shown in the early 2000s predictions.

CLIMATE CHANGE ... VERY INTERESTING
 
The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot to live in, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday, from Consulate at Bergen, Norway.
 
Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone.
 
Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Canada and Siberia will soon be ice-free!
 
Temperate soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the Gulf stream is still very warm.
 
Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared.
 
Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds.
 
Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coast cities uninhabitable.
 
* * ** * * * * *
I must apologize.  I neglected to mention that this report was from November 2, 1922, as reported by the AP and published in The Washington Post  -
95 YEARS ago.
 
This must have been caused by the Model T Ford's emissions or possibly from horse and cattle flatulence. Or our own!

Reasonably speaking:
The Paris Accord is predicted to cause a 30% reduction in CO2, at a cost of 3 TRILLION Dollars! 
Keep in mind that most IPCC temperature prediction increase MODELS have been wrong since FOREVER!

CO2 is 5% of the cause of Global Warming, water vapor(clouds) is 95%! How can humans control CLOUDS??? The Paris Agreement doesn't even MENTION them!
AND, given that CO2 is ONLY 5% of the problem, VOLUNTARILY cutting 30% of it would affect ~1.5% of the problem, or ~1.5% of the expected ~3.8 degree rise in temp at a cost of 3 TRILLION Dollars!! A cost borne ONLY by us and a few other Nations!
Do the math. 
Couldn't the World use that money to do RESEARCH into preventing Global Warming?
Such as firing some cheap rockets full of aluminized powder into space, to give the Earth a SUNSHADE???

Where we differ is the overfishing. Fish plants are facts. Japanese have Carp fish in their rise fields and Thailand country side has ponds. My view is the big pond the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic ocean and Indian ocean, the rich cold water north and and south oceans, Black sea, Lake Baykal etc. For fishing one global agreement is enough, no international fishing without replanting as should be the case with forests.¬†

There is a mental blocking to overcome with planting fish back, not only taking it up until it's empty. This has to be done by international agreements and be codified.¬†

I am for using all urban public spaces for food instead of lawns. It is being done as a test in Britain. For large packed cities like London with 9 million inhabitants, organized food production has to be in place. Small scale initiatives are insufficient and people would starve. The local harvest is once a year and no export and the daily consumption is huge. After a couple of weeks, local food is gone.¬†

As long as there is no call for reduction of humans to restore ecological balance the reasoning is sound. I find no argument what so ever not to clean the oceans, ban pollutions and plant fish in the massive 70% of the earth's surface, done by big corporations under law to provide cheap food for a growing world population.¬†

As a side note on corporations, the olive oil is now cheap and available. The reason is that the picking of olives that used to be done by hand is now done by special picking machines.

Mass land farming is very damaging, yes, but it doesn't have to be like that. We've come to rely on corporations for our food sources which is dangerous economically but also as many prioritise profit over safe conduct environmentally without even getting into the worker's rights etc. By buying locally and bringing back smaller, local farming along with guerrilla gardening and learning to use our own spaces for food, we don't need to destroy land for it. Yes, the rainforest in Brazil is being decimated for farming which is absurd but it's corporation-run and a lot of it is GM soy and corn to feed factory farmed animals so with cutting back on meat consumption there will be a knock on effect as none of these issues are isolated.

I never said they were vegan (veganism in itself is not automatically a healthy diet, it's primarily a way to live that decreases the damage we cause to animals and our environment but it also happens that wholefood, plant-based diets are extremely healthy) just that their consumption of fish is extremely low and their diets are primarily plant-based but the fish isn't necessary for their health.

Really this is too big of a topic to discuss property via YouTube comments just because it's far more complicated than just ""do this one thing"" and everything will be fine but I'll just leave this with a couple of points: We need to cut back massively on meat consumption and those of us who can should go completely without to get rid of factory farms which will cut back on the need for mass-produced soy and corn and stop deforestation for farming. Overfishing needs to stopped immediately but the scale of damage we've caused means fishing really isn't sustainable at all right now but there are people on this planet who do need fish to survive so they need to be taught less damaging ways to fish and keep things small scale, if anyone who doesn't need fish to survive wants it then sure, they can go catch it themselves but we need the industry where profit comes before method to scale down or disappear to allow our oceans to heal. Farmed foods need to be taken back down to small scale so we're less reliant on big businesses and imported food, grassroot movements are already working towards a word where our farmed food is locally grown and organic with minimal environmental damage so we don't need massive land clearing to sustain our food requirements, public spaces should have fruit trees that are free for anyone to take what they need and public gardens should contain edible plants that are available for use as well as whatever you can grow in your back garden, new, large buildings should all be required to have greenhouses on the roof for food farming etc. we have a lot more options than just mass-scale, destructive farming.",0.0,1.0,,qdqPoX9IV9A,

If humans aren't involved then the natural balance in our oceans will eventually return which is great and fish isn't ""wasted"" just because humans don't kill them, the planet and it's animals aren't exactly here to serve us - we're just coexisting. Predators are a natural and necessary part of our oceans and their dwindling numbers is already causing imbalances in the ecosystem. Raising children on just rice and potatoes is a problem, sure, but add some veg, nuts/seeds and legumes and they're perfectly healthy. Yes, the Japanese do well but the Okinawa people in Japan are the longest-living people on the planet with a diet mainly based around potatoes and veg with soy and legumes then a very small amount of fish which isn't even necessary for health because the rest of their diet provides them with everything they need.

If you fancy going out and catching your fish by hand for minimal damage then feel free but it's not necessary. Just a point though, sharks are very important for our oceans and our slaughter of them is causing huuuge damage so eating fish to stop sharks from doing so isn't a valid argument. And yes, the ocean is 70% of the planet but it isn't full of fish just waiting for us to catch and eat, even those fish still around are in very low numbers due to overfishing and we'll run out completely (and cause mass destruction in the process) in a couple decades if we don't stop.",0.0,1.0,,qdqPoX9IV9A,

Global warming is not the issue, the earth has been slowly warming since the last ice age and will continue to do so until it starts cooling for the next ice age. The question is the effect of CO2 released into the atmosphere by human activities. This effect is essentially trivial. This point cannot be argued with someone who does not understand the scientific method and is governed by his feelings. Open your mind and listen to the real scientists and you will learn. FYI, computer models are NOT science! They are a technological ""crystal ball"" that is just about as accurate. I think it was the great sage Yogi Berra who said, ""Making predictions is difficult, especially in regards to the future."" Though we have all met people who have an uncanny ability to predict the past, unfortunately, the current models are unable to even predict the past behavior of the earth's climate.

Politicians are throwing money that they do not have at a problem that does not exist in order to finance solutions that make no difference.
Michael Hart


We were warned in 1961 about government funded ""Science""!
President Eisenhower warned of a ""Technological Elite"" in his farewell address to the nation. I am sure he would have recognized the IPCC as exactly that.


He expressed his concern for corruption of the scientific process as part of this centralization of funding in the Federal government:

Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.

In this revolution, research has become central, it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.

...

The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocation, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.

Yet in holding scientific discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.[1]?",1.0,0.0,,sBFdLcNYjb0,

In 1814 when the River Thames last froze over and these certainly weren't ideal temperatures for life to survive and it won't be much wamer than that in 1850 either. Most of these scare stories relating to natural distastes due to climate change are somewhat baseless. Take the Global Tropical Cyclone Frequency data going back decades that show no clear signs of hurricanes and cyclones intensifying in strength or frequency over the last few decade. NSIDC is showing peak summer/winter melt period of March 2019 no lower than any previous year so all these Arctic free sea ice bollocks is just that.

To reach  950ppm by 2100 requires an instant acceleration of over 300% of the current rate and remain constant for the next 80 years.  Every year that acceleration fails to materialize the bigger the acceleration it has to be the following year.  Hence, why it is extremely unlikely that this scenario will play out and pointless entertaining the idea.  You must admit though, they make good headlines for the masses as sensationalism always sells papers.    
Lamb‚Äôs graph correlates with GISP2 ice core in Greenland which suggests that it wasn‚Äôt just the UK.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Greenland_Gisp2_Temperature.svg
Proxy data from stalagmites in Australia shows a similar correlation.  Here‚Äôs the graph - https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S027737911300303X-gr6.jpg  and here‚Äôs the study - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027737911300303X?via%3Dihub
In fact there‚Äôs a few studies based on Southern Hemisphere proxies that supports the theory that the effects of the Medieval Warm Period for example occurred globally so it wasn‚Äôt just regional.
GISP2 shows that Greenland has been experiencing a long term cooling trend over 1000‚Äôs of years and ends around 1855 i.e. the time our instrument record began which is largely the only graph people see these days.  As Greenland was still experiencing one of the coldest periods in the last 10,000 years and the majority of the time it had been warmer, one can only expect temperatures to rise again to at least somewhere between the long term average however you want to measure that.  Not just for Greenland though, the same applies to everywhere else in the world.  Either that it stays cool or it gets cooler still and we hit another ice age.  The temperature range of GISP2 also shows that Greenland has peaked 2-3 degrees higher than the 1855 levels on several occasions so it won‚Äôt be unusual if it reached similar levels again now or in the future.  Looking at the rates which temperature can swing in GISP2 shows that it is natural for it to switch extremes in relatively short periods of time.
This study which looks at Greenlands temperature stations between 1873-2001 show that the temperature trend for Greenland peaked in the late 30‚Äôs and has been dropping ever since.  This warm period in the 30‚Äôs corresponds with the warm period in the US temperature record, whose raw data also shows temperatures have not peaked since.  Adjusted data does of course but that‚Äôs for another discussion.   https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.852
Still, 2 or 3 degrees is child‚Äôs play compared to the Eemian Period and if the planet were to return to those conditions there‚Äôs nothing we can do other than adapt like our ancestors and every other creature on this planet had to.  
As I said before, the real important question which nobody can answer is how much of this expected and somewhat predicable warming trend since the mid 17th century is natural and what isn‚Äôt?    If the accumulated effect of CO2 wouldn‚Äôt be noticeable until 1950 then the warming trend had been well on its way for the last 300 years before CO2 came into play.  So who is to say that it hasn‚Äôt stopped?  We can‚Äôt because we can‚Äôt separate mans contribution from natural variability.

This I don‚Äôt dispute, what I do dispute and what not one single person alive today and all these societies can state is the all important question of how much because quite frankly it‚Äôs all guess work which is precisely why they have multiple RCP scenarios and 8.5 been the worse case.  The fact that they use all these scenarios, some obviously more likely than others just goes to prove the science isn‚Äôt settled.  Take the science behind the aviation industry, that‚Äôs settled science because no one would ever board a plane if it wasn‚Äôt. 

If the planet wants to warm by 8 degrees and raise sea levels by 10-20m above todays levels for thousands of years there is nothing we can do about it.  Take the Eemian period for example and the fact that polar bears & coral reefs are still thriving despite being exposed to extremes far beyond so give life on Earth some credit because it is far more resilient and adaptable than what people give credit for.  https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/news/news13/greenland-ice-cores-reveal-warm-climate-of-the-past/

So what, we might loose a few beach house properties.  Please explain how this is any different to the last 10,000 years or so as the seas have rising 120m in that period alone.  Our ancestors have been coping with it just fine, so maybe it‚Äôs just this snowflake fad of generation not realising their full potential.  Here‚Äôs a link to the historic temperature graph which was in the first IPCC report which was subsequently removed from all those that followed.  It‚Äôs the same reason why many climate alarmists cut their graphs off at a certain data because data beyond that contradicts what they say.  And yes that is the 20th of the very far right of the graph and this interglacial period is much cooler than the last one and the one before that.  http://www.mitosyfraudes.org/images-20/Kauf-Fig12.gif

Arctic Feedbacks Stopping Winter Ice-Refreezing, Two Videos. Paul Beckwith discusses the very latest cutting edge scientific understanding on a powerful Arctic feedback that keeps regions of open, ice-free Arctic from refreezing during the dead of winter‚ÄìDecember 1st to February 28th:
*Albedo feedbacks are NOT happening at this time since the Arctic is in total 24/7 darkness.
* What IS happening: turbulent heat flux (sensible + latent) plus increased upwelling long-wave radiation brings heat from the ocean up into the lowest 1.5 km of the atmosphere;
* More downwelling long-wave radiation prevents sea-ice formation.
* This feedback increased 8.9% per year from 1979 to 2016.

Changes in Earth‚Äôs tectonism and its orbit are far too slow to have played a significant role in the observed rate of temperature increase over the last 150 years. At the other extreme, large volcanic eruptions have cooled global climate for a year or two, and El Ni√±o episodes have warmed it for about a year, but neither factor dominates longer-term trends. Extensive efforts to find any other natural explanation for the recent trend have similarly failed.

As a result, greenhouse-gas concentrations and solar output are the principal remaining factors that could have changed rapidly enough and lasted long enough to explain the observed changes in global temperature. The 5th IPCC report (2013) concluded that solar irradiance changes contributed only a few percent to changes in radiative forcing of the atmosphere over the past century. Throughout the era of satellite observation, during periods of strong warming, the data show little evidence of increased solar influence (Foster and Rahmstorf, 2011; Lean and Rind, 2008).

Greenhouse gas concentrations remain the major explanation for the warming. Observations and climate model assessments of the natural and anthropogenic factors responsible for this warming conclude that rising anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have been an increasingly important contributor since the mid-1800s and the major factor since the mid-1900s (Meehl et al., 2004). The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is now ~40% higher than peak levels measured in ice cores spanning 800,000 years of age, and the methane concentration is 1.5 times higher (IPCC, 2013). The measured increases in greenhouse gases are more than enough to explain the observed global temperature increase at Earth‚Äôs surface. In fact, considered in isolation, the greenhouse gas increases during the last 150 years would have caused a warming larger than that actually measured, but mechanisms that limit increases in near-surface air temperatures from aerosols, ocean heat storage, and possibly clouds have offset part of the warming. In addition, because the oceans take decades to centuries to respond fully to climatic forcing, the climate system has yet to register the full effect of recent greenhouse gas increases.  https://www.geosociety.org/gsa/positions/position10.aspx",0.0,1.0,,sBFdLcNYjb0,

Their is still ice in the artic. 
New York isent under water.
Sea levals haven't risen. How do I now this I live by the ocean and the high mark on the local pear is exactly where it was when the thing was built 200 years ago. ? 
Its always in the future this thing is going to happen. 
This is beginning to become a real global religion, and how does religion work..Fear plane and simple. C02 is not a real problem it's what plants and trees breath. 
All life on earth is carbon based. 
The ice cap on the north pole is increasing. The polar bears aren't going extinct their are more now than their has been since records started. Why because we stopped killing their main food source the seals. . 
The artic ice mass is growing at a incredible rate. So I realy don't know what the scare mongering is all about. 
The biggest problem is pollution of the oceans. And the destruction of the forests. 
Now no one ever mentions the greening of the planet that has happened over the last 20 years. 
Their has been an increase of about 30% , but that might get in the way of the narrative of the church of climatology. 
I'm sick to the back teeth listening to all this gloom and doom spouted . The simple truth is that the truth is just becoming AN INCONVENIENCE.  Hanson said in 1988 that the children of the northern part of the planet will not know what snow looked like.
Buy 2011. All goor said the artic would be ice free buy 2013 . 
The hottest decade was not the last one but the 19 30 's. The reality is that the temperature is lower now than it was in the 1960's but because of a bit of scull duggary with the real temperature records they have managed to show the temperature has risen. 
And how come it's never mentioned that the farmers in Holland pump C02 into their greenhouse's. ..? Yes weather conditions have changed over the  years but they have and always will. .!  So I stick my neck out on this and will get attacked by people. But before you do especially those of you who live on the coast . Go and look at the high tide marks..and compare them to where they were 50 years ago. 
Also measure the temp in a car park or city street , then go out of town say a field and take another reading and see the difference. 
Then look on a map where all the weather stations are and compare whare they are now as to when they were first erected. 
Oh the one in Berkley is outside the window of the climate research lab.. in a car park.? 
Seams that all the so called scientists make a very good living  on the government grants they receive and are competing with each other to come up with new models for climate change. 
Models are just that they are not and have not ever matched the real records ! 
Has the sea risen buy 20ft .? 
Is their ice on the north pole. ? 
Has the sahell Reagan of North Africa got greener. ? 
Anyway I have stopped fretting about all this as I was one of the first generation that got realy upset with the fact that man was causing global warming and like the kids today , shouted about how we have to change our ways
And stop burning coal etc. 
Now I see that the world isent going to end in the next few years , it will ceep on turning and slowly the stuff being forced down people's knecks is all the biggest con in the history of mankind.  
Is Antarctica melting. ? 
In 1973 their were only a few hundred polar bears in spalbard. 
Now their are thousands. ? 
But no one ever mentions the sun? 
The biggest Neuclear reactor in the solar system and how it goes through hot and cold cycles. 
As I said before all life on the planet is carbon based, so the fact that plants and trees can now breath easier, how is that a bad thing. ?",1.0,0.0,,sBFdLcNYjb0,

I take your point but one of the things I've had to (very reluctantly) learn in my career as a Project Manager is that in any negotiation both sides usually go in with utopian, possibly undeliverable, demands, and then an agreement is reached somewhere in the middle. If these groups just demanded that our governments tried a little bit harder, then politicians would do nothing, and concentrate on fighting all the other fires that they always see to be fighting. If however, they sense a genuine threat to their political existence then they may actually start putting in more radical measures.Personally I am no anarchist. We need structure. We need laws. And we need some form of hierarchy (however toxic that word may have become). But Roger Hallam of XR isn't doing this as a knee jerk reaction. He has studied the history of non-violent civil disobedience and it demonstrates that this is the only way that things get changed quickly. Thanks for supporting the channel. All the best.

Sure, sounds great: earth will be better off with less people (and by the way I fully agree with you).  HOWEVER, we need to understand and be prepared for the full impact of negative growth.  
Decrease in population growth leads to decrease in economic growth, accompanied by a decrease in domestic demand accompanied by an increase in the number of persons who have been made redundant (increase in unemployment) and a risk of deepening social polarisation, which is reflected in a¬†decrease in the countries GDP which results in reduced taxes for governments but a bigger demand for governments to provide social support to all the unemployed.   
No more growth = recession and a lengthy resign leads to a depression.  And if you think that‚Äôs fun, go and look at what happened in the Great Depression of 1930‚Äôs.

The United States knows this better than any, so it elects boneheads that have made it rich from big oil to lead them (at least for now).  These same idiots claim that babies are the way to solve the problem rather than part of the problem (more babies was LITERALLY stated as a climate change solution recently on the Senate floor - https://youtu.be/chdKtF3FYz0?t=101 ).  So if the solution requires the economic paradigm that brought more short-term prosperity to the world than any other to be rethought and that we limit our numbers through state mandates, then what?  Is humanity intelligent enough to do what must be done in that case without a fight?  I have my doubts it is.  Just read comments on videos like this from the loads of people that can't deal with the truth and tell me we can deal with this problem.  I think we actually can solve the climate change/pollution/overpopulation problem, but FIRST, there must be mass death (and I mean hundreds of millions killed in rich countries too) from climate chaos.  The human population must be first decimated to get the reality of what must be done through humanity's collective thick ape skull.  And what is it that must be done?  We all know in our hearts the solution: we must throw out capitalism in its current form and stop unrestrained baby popping in favor of an economic paradigm centered around the sustainability of existing life and population control.  There is no other way, and if we can't get that message in time, then humanity will, as millions of species before it, perish from the Earth.

I hold to an understanding that your philosophical/theological worldview matters in a real way. If for instance, your deepest beliefs are acted out coherently, the resulting tragedy or flourishing of humanity, are indicative of the level of deception or truth that you place your basic assumptions on.

The full title of Darwin‚Äôs most notable work, ‚ÄúOn the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life‚Äù, seems to me to be enormously overlooked today. I find a pretty logical and direct philosophical path from the ideas contained there to the great tragedies of the 20th century, as experienced under the fascist and communist regimes. Please note, I am not in any way holding Darwin responsible per se. I am just noting what seems like a logical and intellectually coherent pathway from Darwin‚Äôs full theory to those results and noting this as an anecdote.

I don‚Äôt know what definition of evolution you would be using but I‚Äôll assume that you mean unguided, materialistic, nothing to molecules to man evolution. I have told you that I am a Christian so you could probably deduct that I am skeptical about that. 

Obviously, even a theistic evolutionist would not believe in the unguided part of that if one insists on philosophical coherence.

My perception is that ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù science has not truly recovered from the ascent of the ‚ÄúBig Bang theory‚Äù, after all, going from infinity to even a billion or two years is a very big jump. As is going from a theoretical understanding of ‚Äòprotoplasm‚Äô in the 19th century, to detailed understanding of the biochemical makeup of proteins and DNA.

I definitely hold to the idea that life forms evolve and adapt (or die). We can clearly tell that things mutate and change, however it seems pretty obvious that it is much easier for organisms to gain ‚Äòsurvivability‚Äô by ‚Äòlosing‚Äô genetic information than by gaining it. For instance, when humans adapted to more northern latitudes, they lost their melanin. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to find  persuasive evidence of evolutionary mechanisms that are generative in nature rather than degenerative. Obviously I am not making an argument on the fact, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt understand it so it must not exist‚Äù. :-) But as a matter of course, I don‚Äôt have that understanding.

You're correct that very little proof exists to demonstrate whether the SH was affected in 1816.  I've found one source that refers to it (see below).  But that's what I expect to find.  If there was little or no impact to local SH weather in 1816, then it stands to reason that there would be little or no record of it.  I've followed up by reading two different journals from Australia for 1815/1816.  Nothing unusual seems to have befallen the colony due to the eruptions.  I would not go so far as to claim that this is irrefutable proof - but I do stick by my contention that the 1816 results of the 1815 eruption were episodic and not global. 

I'm sorry to tell you, but there exists so much evidence, incontrovertible data, that indicates that CO2 is triggering Climate Change. So many reference articles exist, that I wouldn't know which sources to provide you as proof (although I'm inclined to believe you'd not take the time to review these).   Perhaps your intent was to focus on whether there is a causal relationship between Catastrophic events and CO2.  As you know the mainstream media would say yes.  Many scientists, who years ago predicted that this would happen, would also concur.  Others that aren't tied to past predictions, would also agree.  Personally, as you well suspect, I'm also inclined to believe it is so.   My impression, is not based on interpretation per se, but rather on the data; flood levels are easily measurable and data points go back a couple hundred years.  Same thing goes for temperature highs/ lows.   If these events were isolated or episodic, I'd agree that it's all just hyperbole.  But the fact that nearly every country in the world has experienced 'record floods and/or droughts, record temp highs and lows'.  Can these events be proven 100% to be due to CO2 induced climate change?  I don't think so.  As such, this admission would suggest that you are not wrong.  The problem is that little in life is every black and white.  Sometimes we have to go with 90% confidence levels.  

I've come across both Malthus and Erhlich, but have read neither of them.  I wonder why you refer to them?  As proof of incorrect predictions or perhaps the idea that surplus populations will be culled by lack of resources, etc?

Since you agree that population at such numbers is staggering - would you not agree that such numbers would obviously cause harm to the planet generally and affect climate specifically?

Memory is something that seems to be becoming more important with time, when I went to check up on the temperature, the first search result was Wikipedia which gave the numbers you have, however I was able to find my original source, NCAR (National center for Atmospheric Research) gave the 3C temperature figure, NCARs later references to that event doesn‚Äôt give specific temperatures. Either way, my point was, that didn‚Äôt trigger a runaway cooling cycle. Even if the lower figures are correct, that is a huge change in that period of time. As far as that being a northern hemisphere only event, we simply don‚Äôt know, very few written records were being kept in the temperate zone of the SH.

Of no particular import but the 'Year Without Summer' was in 1816 and most believe it was caused by the 1815 eruption (not 1814) of  Mt Tambora.  Though there was another volcanic eruption in 1814 from another volcano that surely didn't help.  The estimates I've seen for the impact on global average temperature were from 0.4 to 0.7¬∞C (0.7-1.3¬∞F).  The average surface temp was said to be affected by about 1¬∞C.  Not sure where you got your info - perhaps recheck and/or cross-check.   There's a HUGE difference between these figures and the 3¬∞ C you quoted, btw.   Most importantly: you're using this example to somehow prove that such anomalies are short lived and natural.  A bit more research will help you discover that though devastating to many countries, the so called Year Without Summer was a Northern Hemisphere issue.  So as bad as the eruption was, it wasn't a global phenomenon.  ACC is  global.  Every continent has been, is, and will continue to be affected. 

Strange to me that so skeptics never really account for the impact of the exponential growth of global population since pre-industrial times - an increase in 6 billion people within 250 years.  Gary have you any conception how large a number one billion is, let alone 7.6 billion?  I don't mean to condescend - for I myself can barely fathom the enormity of this number.  How anybody can imagine that a completely unprecedented number such as this, would have ZERO impact on the globe, including affected climate staggers the mind.  Add to that the insane number of large mammals - we've decimated the forests and jungles to house/feed - and you get some more billions of unprecedented critters and their impacts.

There was an interesting study after the 2012 storm in New York detailing how much worse the storm would have been if you raised sea surface temperature 2C. I think the science was perfectly reasonable theoretical science, the problem with it was that it never modeled the exact meteorological conditions that we would experience in that scenario. Why? Because it simply isn‚Äôt possible. The result is we know some cool things, but we didn‚Äôt learn anything of real value.

The basic claim, that the so-called 97 percent of scientists believe, is that a very small increase in energy conservation causes by elevated levels of CO2 is a very believable claim. That increased level of temperature increases the level of water vapor in the air which has a much greater effect on warming than CO2. So far so good.

The alarmists basically argue that water vapor feedback is the cause of runaway, one directional warming.

My contention is that, that almost certainly cannot be true. If that were the case, an extraordinary active sunspot cycle, particularly combined with the Milankovitch cycle, combined with volcanic activity, would easily produce a short term global temperature increase that would have triggered this water vapor feedback.

Another fun anomaly; Mt Tambora volcano in 1814 caused the ‚Äòyear without a summer‚Äô across North America and Europe. It is estimated that the energy blocking effect of the aerosols from that eruption, lowered global temperature by about 3 degrees C. Yet the global temperature rather quickly recovered and things went back to normal.

If you stop the narrative at the water vapor feedback, it sounds like you might have a case. But the huge unknown is cloud formation. You do need water vapor for cloud formation. Even further complicating it, is the fact not all clouds are equal. Some clouds, particularly nighttime clouds have an even greater warming effect, however, daytime clouds often have enormous cooling effects. Reality tends to cut both ways,  normally you can safely discount voices that claim the evidence is all one way.

So far I believe I have explained a fair bit more than you have about how climate is actually understood to work. That absolutely doesn‚Äôt mean I am on the right side of the argument, but I believe I have outlined a reasonable skepticism.

I understand that you like to look at this indicator.  Many of the skeptics do.  I'll explain later why I think it's the last thing we should be looking at.  But first: 
(I THINK) that the first folks to raise the warning bell regarding Climate Change (Global Warming, back then) used sea level rise and discussed the end case scenario, did so to try to wake people up.  Knowing that many of the largest urban/financial centres are on the coast and knowing that most people would understand this, they used Sea Level rise to try to 'personalize' the threat for them.  Also, it's must easier to 'visualize' / imagine water rising & flooding and the damage it causes, than attempting to imagine and grasp the importance of air temperature increases.   I think that they were alarmist in the sense that they used end-case to scare the people.  I disagree with this approach and I think that Gore et al have regretted it.  

Catastrophic Sea Level rise will be the final result Gary.  It'll be slow and increase exponentially.  But by the time it does do the damage we foresee it'll be too late.  NYC will start to be affected but only after many nations are annihilated (think Malta, Bangladesh).   What we need to watch right now, is average global temp rise - both at the atmospheric level, ground level and sea temp., levels.  These are what matter most.  So if you focus on Sea Level - as the early proponents erring tried to get you to do - you lose focus of the more important first steps.  

YOUR QUESTIONS:  
I have question for you that I haven‚Äôt been able to get a satisfactory answer for so far. What is the ideal CO2 level for human flourishing. And what is the most ideal global temperature for the greatest human comfort? Why does not the climate scientists and all of their modeling tell us this?

The issue Gary, is that I'm not sure there is such a thing.  There are safe maximums, to be certain.  And what I think you are driving at, is that humans are extremely adaptable.  But as mentioned previously, for evolutionary adaptation to occur, things have to progress gradually.  When changes (i.e. climate changes) occur dramatically, over a relatively short period of change, species don't have the time to adapt. ¬†

Now, to answer your question, in part:  
""""the threshold at which the human body is no longer able to cool itself and begins to overheat is a humidity level of 50% and a high heat of 46 ¬∞C (115 ¬∞F), as this would indicate a wet-bulb temperature of 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F).""""
So if you live in a country where A/C is not available  (due to unavailable power), once these temps hit, people die.  And rather quickly.   Just last summer, where I live, we had many deaths due to the heat waves.  ""What's new?  We've always had that.""  True -and even more true before we had electricity and a/c for most people in developed world.  What's unique is that these were regional events and now they will occur globally.  And this will diminish life spans as well as life expectancy.  

Climate scientists don't model this Gary, for the obvious and facile reason, that this is not their job.  They do climate.  You need biologist for this.  So, if you study biological evidence, you'll find your limits.... BUT

But just for the sake of argument.  Let's say that humans can withstand great variations.  It's the agriculture that cannot.  I've heard that there is a 4¬∞ 'optimum window' at which crops can yield maximally.  So if it gets too hot/too cold, mass agricultural failure can & will occur.  Does that mean that no plant will produce anything?  No.  But it means that yield will diminish to the point that we will not be able to sustain the 7+ Billion people on the planet.  So, it's not so much what's comfortable for humans as what's more comfortable for the plants and insects and wildlife (pollination)  to be able to exist.",0.0,1.0,,sBFdLcNYjb0,

Agriculture
You are partly right  (primarily regarding the US, I believe) in that current crop yields are currently up.  But it is seen as a temporary result of the increase in average global temps.  They expect this to change in the coming years.   Here are a few notable excerpts: 
""""Average yields of many commodity crops (for example, corn, soybean, wheat, rice, .... decline beyond certain maximum temperature thresholds (in conjunction with rising atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO2] levels), and thus long-term temperature increases may reduce future yields....In contrast, even with warmer temperatures, future yields for certain crops such as wheat, hay, and barley are projected to increase in some regions due to anticipated increases in precipitation and carbon fertilization. However, yields from major U.S. commodity crops are expected to decline as a consequence of higher temperatures,  especially when these higher temperatures occur during critical periods of reproductive development.""""

""""Crop productivity and quality may also be significantly reduced due to increased crop water demand coupled with limited water availability...as well as increased diseases and pest infestations""""

""""Soil erosion by water is one of the major environmental threats to sustainable crop production. It can also adversely affect drainage networks, water quality.... Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme precipitation events in many regions of the United States""...""An analysis of historical data on extreme single-day precipitation events in the United States occurring from 1910‚Äì2017 shows that the share of land area that experienced extreme precipitation regimes remained fairly steady until the 1980s but has risen significantly since then""

You mentioned your attention to, study of Ecosystems.  Here are a few salient excerpts from the same report: 

""""There is increasing evidence that climate change is impacting biodiversity, and species and populations are responding in a variety of ways. Individuals may acclimate to new conditions..."" ¬†

BUT here's the kicker to the suggestion that it'll all be okay due to evolution and adaptation: 
""""Although relatively fast evolutionary changes have been documented in the wild,10,11,12 rapid environmental changes can exceed the ability of species to track them.13 Thus, evidence to date suggests that evolution will not fully counteract negative effects of climate change for most species""""

""""Climate change is altering ecosystem productivity, exacerbating the spread of invasive species, and changing how species interact with each other and with their environment. These changes are reconfiguring ecosystems in unprecedented ways.""""

I find when you first interact with someone virtually, it comes easily and natural to throw insults and low resolution/dogmatic comments around, but after three or four exchanges, our brains seem to catch on that we are speaking with humans/individuals. We can all do better, and believe me, honey does attract more flies than vinegar as they say. I‚Äôve certainly traded comments with more ‚Äòabrasive‚Äô folks than you. By a lot:-)

It is somewhat likely I would be more persuadable if the early ‚Äòalarmers‚Äô would have led with more nuanced opinions, and then sort of casually threw out the more catastrophic possibilities. Gores movie and subsequent Nobel prize sort of put him and any climate scientists that didn‚Äôt call him out at the time in a pretty big credibility hole for me.

Technically you are correct on what constitutes an ‚Äòappeal to authority‚Äô, but I think about it like this, If what you think about science comes from the foundational ‚Äòhard sciences‚Äô such as mathematics and physics, then an appeal to a reputable scientist in such a discipline would not constitute a logical fallacy.
However pointing to the hypothetical or predictive disciplines is begging the question. In other words if their predictions come true it‚Äôs not ‚Äòappealing to authority‚Äô if they are all wrong then it pretty much is a logical fallacy. If their predictions are pretty much coming true, then they are building credibility, if they are mostly either not coming true or if climatic conditions are largely falling inside of historic norms then it gets complicated. It is still pretty early on to form too harsh of judgement one way or another, as the arbitrary number I have heard used is, we need 30 years of data to constitute ‚Äòclimate‚Äô direction. Shorter than that is ‚Äòweather patterns‚Äô, not hanging my hat on that, but it sounds good enough for me.

It seems to me that if the early believers would have been serious about CO2 emissions reduction, they would not have politicized the issue so much.
If I was certain of a coming disaster, the first thing I would do would be to figure out how to communicate my concern in a nonpartisan way. The second would be to establish directional mile markers that would measure progress toward or away from the catastrophe.

I'm not gonna share another site I found that expressed it more like you see it. ;)   So, in essence it's a moot point at best.  Agree to differ on it. 

Naturally I dislike 'Global Warming' because in some places it'll be cooler.  And the deniers and skeptics (a la trump not so long ago) like to (wrongly) scream out, ""Where's all that global warming?""

Appeals to Authority: 
My turn to tell you that I think you misunderstand this logic fallacy.  An appeal to authority is when you   ask another person to accept/believe  (or you yourself believe) a person's point of view/stance/opinion/theory based not on data, observation or experimentation but solely on who they are relative to their societal standing, position or reputation. ""Well, John is the best butcher I know and he works in the freezer frequently, so when he tells me things in Antartica are just fine, I accept that.""    But if, for example, you happen to accept James Hansen's statement that he is 99% sure that Climate Change is anthropogenic because he shows you the experiments he's done, the data he has collected and the observations he has made which he compared to other observations - this is NOT an appeal to authority.  Which is the reason that I harp so much on ""data"", sources and references.  True some people may not be able to understand all the data...but some of us, even if we're not climate scientists may be able to figure it out nonetheless. 

You've made some good points and asked interesting questions.  I'll review, consider and respond later as I'm pressed for time.",0.0,1.0,,sBFdLcNYjb0,

You say climate change encompasses global warming. As I understand it, global warming describes an average temperature increase of the Earth over time.  Climate change describes how weather patterns will be affected around the globe as a result of that increase. I believe you got that backwards. I call it Global Warming because that is the overarching claim and somewhat more falsifiable/provable than say, we had a big storm and that was directly linked to global warming.

I was particularly puzzled by the link you gave me this time, sure hunger/poverty is increasing in some parts of the world, but that is a completely different thing from world food production declining. I keep up with USDA stats for that, according to their data US and global food productivity is definitely increasing. For some time now hunger has been due to political instability/distribution problems not production.

I condescend on the 97 percent figure because of how misleading it is. The original study of peer reviewed literature made the claim that 97 percent of published climate scientists concluded that AGW from CO2 is very likely causing warming. I agree with that statement. The 97 percent do not necessarily make any claim about the severity or even whether it good or bad.

You keep appealing to authority and wanting me to do likewise. I really don‚Äôt get that. It seems to me that if terrible, unparalleled catastrophe is unfolding before our very eyes, you wouldn‚Äôt need to appeal to authority. That is why I gave the sea level rise argument. That seems like a good indicator all sides agree on.
Food production stats is another, we know the claims that are made by the alarmist. We can look at data from somewhat independent organizations. I am skeptical of the alarmists, you are skeptical of the skeptics. It seems as though we need to look at some (relatively) independent data to check evidence against.

I point to the 1930s for two reasons. One, to continue to agree that regional/anecdotal evidence can be highly misleading. And two, to hypothesize how strong the emotional persuasion would be if such a weather pattern hit us right now, but in hindsight how terribly misleading it would have been.

I have question for you that I haven‚Äôt been able to get a satisfactory answer for so far. What is the ideal CO2 level for human flourishing. And what is the most ideal global temperature for the greatest human comfort? Why does not the climate scientists and all of their modeling tell us this?

And a bonus one. What level of hardship/adversity or convenience is the most conducive to human satisfaction and happiness?",0.0,1.0,,sBFdLcNYjb0,

Hold on to your straw hat my friend, for if you thought I was condescending before, you're about to feel even worse. ¬†But first;  it's climate change rather than global warming.  The former encompasses the latter. 

In addition to what I perceive as close-mindedness, I'll say that I think you're little more than a contrarian.  But let me first address why I find you close-minded, in case it's not apparent enough as it is.    You agree that the vast majority of the world's scientist say that climate change is a major problem - and yet you suggest that it's of no import.   Gary that you disagree with me, has nothing to do with why I find you close-minded.  I find you close-minded because nothing touches you, no argument whether by me or the science community regarding the calamitous state we are in, seems to hold any value to you.¬†

What's interesting to me Gary is that despite your obvious intelligence, you overlook a simple error in your reasoning.  In your view, the primary reason for discounting these climate scientists is that they are humans, and humans have biases.  And as such their interpretation of data is suspect due to their biases and human motives (I say this is your 'primary reasoning' 'cause you've mentioned it several times in your posts ... AND... you offer little else to counter the weight of scientific opinion).  Gary, do you not see the irony and fallacy in your reasoning?  Assuming you are human, then your bias and inherent human motives might be affecting your views.  Maybe the scientific community is fine, but it's your bias that is getting in the way and stopping you from seeing what the rest of the world has seen. 

The dissenters in the climate science community are not nit-wits.  But they can be wrong.   But even that approach of yours lacks common sense (are you really a farmer?!?!  Most farmers I know have rock solid common sense).   Imagine one day that you wake up and feel horrible, zero energy.  This persists and you decide to consult a doctor.  He administers blood tests and an x-ray.  He tells you, that it looks like you've got cancer.  Being a skeptic, you decide to get a 2nd opinion...and a 3rd...and well you visit 100 doctors.  97 of them say, 'Yep, looks like cancer.""  What are you gonna do Gary - you gonna follow the advice of the 3 that said you've got allergies?   Or are you gonna say, ""well, the human body is really resilient, I've got anti-bodies..."" or are you gonna get the treatment that those 97 Dr's suggest?  

Contrarian.  I tell you about the data and the climate science community - they're not honest or are biased.  I tell you what about the majority of people, as polled.  You say, ""ah, the masses, what do they know.'  I tell you about million plus students marching - 'ah, they're just wanting a day out of class'.  I tell you, just look outside - meaning, look at your own changing climate, you say, 'ah, that's foolish, what would I know.'   If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck....  Contrarian.

Ecosystems.  
There have been 5 global extinctions that we know of.  Yes, ecosystems are resilient - until they aren't.  How many references would you like me to provide you that will confirm that food production is down, globally due to climate change factors?  I'll leave you with one, but I can provide you with umpteen. ¬†
""New evidence in this year‚Äôs report highlights that beside conflicts, climate variability and extremes are also a key force behind the recent rise in global hunger. They are also one of the leading causes of severe food crises.""
http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/

Gary it was 'disastrous' in the US in the '30's.  Major droughts.  BUT, mostly just the US.  The rest of the world didn't experience anything exceptional.  The GLOBAL average was unaffected.  The global average temperature has risen.  Every year now, for the past 5 or so has seen record setting weather (heat, cold, floods, droughts) GLOBALLY.   Your analogy is faulty.  

Gary - what are you credentials?  What's your education like?  What's your expertise in?   Just curious.¬†
Furthermore, it would be nice if you gave me something concrete to go on, regarding your dissension, aside from ""bias"" and ""this happened"" before.  What are you afraid to tell me about your beliefs?

I am a farmer by trade, an industry that values broad general education/knowledge probably as much as or more than any other. Close minded? That‚Äôs probably the most condescending thing you have said so far. I don‚Äôt agree with you on the cost/benefits or severity of AGW, so I am close minded.

A person could be pretty open mind in a lot of areas but close minded in a few, or you could be opposite. Who gets to decide what constitutes open mindedness;-)

I, like the 97 percent of scientists believe that CO2 has a greenhouse effect, causing a small amount of temperature forcing, which causes an increase in evaporation rates, which causes higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere which causes (relatively speaking)a significant amount of heat trapping. 

BTW, what kind of nitwits are the other 3 percent anyway? :-0
The fact that NASA feels the need to put such a meaningless statistic on their website does little to bolster their credibility.

Just from a broad perspective of why I am not concerned about runaway GW, I am interested in ecosystems. One thing you learn pretty quickly is that they are quite resilient. Take the travesty that is our modern agriculture, try as we might we can‚Äôt completely destroy our food production ecosystems. In fact we are producing more than ever before, in the US and globally. (Sorry Al Gore,IPCC etc.)

I see our planet as a kind of whole ecosystem. Ecosystems can have positive feedback loops, but they must have even stronger negative feedback loops or they would crash and burn. The fact we‚Äôre here suggest rather strongly that the climate system on Earth is fairly resilient as well.

The reason I don‚Äôt post links is pretty simple, data and studies usually don‚Äôt mean all that much until they are interpreted by experts, that introduces the human factor into the discussion. The interpreters will usually go with one of two narratives. Our a priori assumptions will either be ‚Äòconfirmed‚Äô or we‚Äôll reject said interpreter as a bad faith actor. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say I only accept personal experience as valid, in fact, theoretically I believe the opposite, however if we had the large scale weather extremes that we had in the 1930s, I fear I would be tempted to go with personal experience plus the expert opinion. As we can see now that would be an erroneous approach. I guess you could see how anecdotes like that would play right now??
I do tend to be suspicious of narrative driven reporting, the aspect of every story that promotes warming is amplified, the aspects that would have a cooling effect are always diminished. Unless you are on the ‚Äòdenialist‚Äô side. Then of course it tends to be the opposite. Personally I try follow those that try to evaluate all the evidence, regardless of which ‚Äòside‚Äô it supports.

Another minor reason for skepticism, there are claims you can test yourself. Just the other week the Guardian ran a headline about glacial ice and Arctic ice that was ‚Äòvanishing‚Äô. Sounds like Northern hemisphere ice would be on track to disappear in 5-10 years right? Except sea level is only rising .13 inches per year. Its enough ice in just Greenland to raise sea levels 25 feet. Can you really believe anything in that article?

I do get frustrated trying to find honest brokers of information, but the reality is people are motivated by competing factors. The best you do is take notes see how particular people/organizations predictions change/disappear/come true. You say we don‚Äôt have time for that. I suppose we‚Äôll just have to disagree. Cheers

But also clearly, I'm dealing with a person with a closed mind due to his politics or age.  I also wonder if I'm not dealing with somebody that thinks he knows more than he actually does.  But what is clear is that unlike myself, you offer nothing of substance - no sources, no references, no credentials - aside from the meanderings of your mind.  Some say that wisdom is conferred on the aged.  I've seen this is not necessarily always the case.   

We don't necessarily need to cut back 30% on our energy consumption.  We need to change the source of that energy.  Positing false dichotomies is the mark of a lazy mind Gary. 

I'm glad you like reliable affordable energy.  What if we added renewable on top of that?  And why not less polluting?    Solar.  Wind.  Hydro.  Yes, there will be some folks that may have to resort to nuclear, but it need not be everybody.  

You are right about one thing ....broken clocks? ;) ...  the very same folks polled that said they were very worried and/or somewhat concerned about Climate Change, also said that they would refuse to disburse $10/ month if it meant it could help fight climate change.    You'll laugh and nod your head here.  I sigh and shake mine.  The problem is that these people may not understand how grave the situation is.  You don't see it either.  But here's the catch, Gary, not just a few climate scientists, but thousands of them believe we are at the edge of a precipice.  And it's folks like yourself that refuse to accept what is clear but that make educating others more challenging...and a longer process.  Time which we may not have.

School children.  Yes, a fair amount might have walked out for the sheer pleasure of missing a day.  But, surely you're not so jaded as to deny the worth of a number these young people who organize and fight vociferously for their lives.  

You farm.  I like farmers.  I taught farmers' kids for over 20 years.  Farmers, though generally conservative, are hard working, no nonsense people.  Charitable too. I wonder if you're a farmer and share these values - or perhaps you just dabble a bit.  In any case, I'm guessing that you live somewhere near or above the 40th parallel and probably on the east rather than the west coast.  I say this because if you lived below you'd be dreadfully worried right now.   You're lucky that you've not noticed climate issues.  As you'll see by the references below, it's a growing agricultural nightmare.  

Oh and Gary, sticking your head out the window is far from foolish.  In fact, for somebody such as yourself that eschews scientists because they are all so dreadfully human, one would think that you're pretty much just relying on your own sense of things.  Most of us older folks that have been around the better part of a century have no problems telling you that the weather patterns of the last few years are unlike anything we've seen before.  It's not a ""one season"" anomaly.  It's a year round one, for several years now.  

As to 'the masses'. For sure, people have always liked to talk in hyperboles.  Today's sensationalistic media makes things worse.  But what you don't mention is that we have loads of data that confirm: we're getting the hottest years on record, the largest daily rainfalls, the greatest financially costly disasters (floods / forest fires)  we've ever had.  

Yes, we've always experienced floods, droughts, storms, heat waves and the like.  But their frequency and severity all across the globe are unprecedented...and they were predicted.  That's the issue Gary. 

Here are the sources I'll provide today - once again so that people happening across this discourse won't just have the inane ramblings of who knows who.

We in the western world have mostly been a huge exception to the rule. The values that we adopt has a great deal to do with that. That is only a side point to me.

As far as sticking my head out the window, number one, that is foolish. My anecdotal experience of local/regional weather tells me nothing about climate change. 

Number two, part of my living is from organic farming, so I am profoundly interested in local and regional weather patterns and have been for most of my life. The only climate change I see is in the newsrooms and some  scientific forums/panels. The problem with all scientists is that they are people. They have world-views, biases, and motivational factors that effect their work. I love science, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I accept the work of a person just because of some credentials they have.

I read the article you referred me to, I have seen that study referenced quite a few times. While I don‚Äôt consider it a particularly rigorous study, suppose the numbers given are an accurate representation of reality. So. Let‚Äôs cut back thirty percent of our global energy consumption and see how many premature deaths we have. 

Me and you could very well be among them. 

You accuse me of loving fossil fuels, you would be wrong. I love reliable, affordable energy and want more of the world to benefit from it as I do.

I bring up nuclear because that is the only option that is proven, reliable, safe (per unit of energy produced) and carbon free. Bill Gates has concluded the same thing, BTW.

Public opinion, ah what fun. People in the modern era have always been convinced that it is the hottest, coldest, wettest,  driest, stormiest time in the history of the universe. You can find articles in the news as far back as our records go to prove that. 

Millions of schoolchildren skipped school to protest? Say it ain‚Äôt so! I would have hated so badly to miss a day of school when I was young:-)

Do folks say yes when ask if they are for a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that they are sure richer folks will have to pay for? Of course.

AGM claims are not preposterous.  Stick your head out a window, you'll notice things are not what they once were, in the recent and not so recent past. ¬†

As to the number of people dead as a result of Climate Change, the numbers vary from hundreds of thousands to millions per year.  Personally, I don't think deaths due to fossil fuel pollution - which is awful - should be tied in directly to climate change, which is why I quoted the smaller numbers previously.   I won't bother giving you dozens of sources to back up what I said, but I'll leave one.  I know you'll ignore it as it doesn't fit in with your fossil fuel for breakfast world view, but perhaps an interested third party might come across this exchange and it would surely be refreshing to have real sources rather than off-the-cuff statements by who knows who, with who knows what kind of credentials.  

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/global-warming-and-health/

Your claim that any development is dependant on 'fossil fuel & huge populations' is utterly ridiculous.  We had locomotives without either.  Many developments are possible without either. 

Me thinks you jump to Nuclear energy as you see it as yet another divisive issue, upon which you can choose to support the contentious side.  It's like you know people aren't too keen on nuclear - rightfully so - and so you're setting up this false dichotomy to get people to choose between two equally poor options.   I live in a place that does really well with Hydro Electricity; which I would choose any day before either. I'd choose solar and wind as well.  But, I'm guessing you think that wind turbine noise causes cancer.  

Lastly as to the ""marginalized"" due to the very real fear posed to our species by climate change...well...over a million KIDS took to the streets to protest a few weeks ago.  That's just kids.  When millions protest for something, I don't quite think that you can consider them 'marginal' - even though you probably wish they were. ¬†

Not sure what your nationality is, but recent US polls suggest that the MAJORITY of Americans are either very worried about, or somewhat worried, about climate change.  Here's a reference for you:

By then, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, had already reached 350 ppm.  The global average temperature associated with that level of CO2 was already going to go beyond 4 degrees C above pre-industrial averages.  The only difference is it would have taken much longer to reach that level, as the ice would not have melted as quickly, giving many species time to adapt to the changing climate, and humans would have had a much better chance of finding tech to take CO2 out of the atmosphere.  Now above 410 ppm of CO2, the change is happening much too fast for any chance at adaptation or removal.

There are a myriad of positives for human health based on the solutions proposed for 0 emmission transition so even on those merits you should support it unless you're a sociopath who wants others to asphyxiate on pollution.

And please understand me, I am not saying that climate change does not exist!  No offense but I find it quite ridiculous that many cannot discern between those that question the effect of man-made CO2 on naturally occurring climate change and those who deny climate change altogether. I agree completely with you it would be insane to deny climate change is real, it is something that has been happening for hundreds of millions of years, ever since there was a climate existing on the planet. It's quite easy to put someone who is questioning man's effect on naturally occurring climate change into this category and then calling them stupid and dismissing what they're saying. It's the same way a lot of our bitter politics work these days. That being said, I believe that the trillions of dollars needed to fund an effort that in my opinion would really have almost no effect on naturally occurring climate change would in fact bring about the massive human suffering and disaster that you speak of. In fact many have done studies on just exactly what would occur if every single tenant of the Paris Accord were met by every single country on the list, and as expected the effect would be almost negligible. I feel it would be much more sensible to actually take the time and make a complete and robust model of our climate system they could actually be used as a predictive mechanism. no matter what happens with our climate system which is of course changing and will change until the planet is gone, presumably swallowed up by the atmosphere of the sun as it expands when it dies, or by an asteroid hitting us, etc.  we have to deal with it. Having several degrees in science and having worked on simulation models for decades I do know something about the subject of robust simulation model. Creating advanced models of electrical designs and the internals of integrated circuits is very complex but child's play compared to creating a model of the climate that is accurate and robust. In my view we have a long long way to go before we can make any kind of predictions or statements about the effect of man-made inputs over one of the minor gases that affects climate change. Moreover there have been plenty of times in the history of the Earth where the level of CO2 is much higher than 400 parts per million and I don't see the catastrophe that you seem to be predicting indicated in the temperature record. I would say to you that for the very reasons you bring up, we spend our precious treasure on something we do understand fully and can change for the better, rather than assume a faulty model along with its faulty predictions are 100% gold and true, and will produce an outcome that is worth the trillions put into it. I immediately know someone is not a scientist at all when they  utterly reject others opinions or people that point out fault in a model that's just starting to be developed. if that were the case Einstein would have been thrown in prison just like the Catholics threw Galileo in prison for daring to assert that the Earth rotated around the sun (which was the scientific consensus at the time).... It was assumed that only Newtonian physics would describe the universe until crazy stupid old Einstein came up with his theory of relativity that shows there are many examples of non-Newtonian frames of reference is where this is simply not true. True scientist embrace each other's differences and opinions and listen to them, not simply create an atmosphere of fear over ridiculous predictions, or even worse threatened to jail fire or otherwise punish anyone who doesn't agree with their theory.

1) Millions die early from air pollution or die entirely because of it whether by pollution-based suicide, repeatedly travelling in high-pollution areas without a mask, or indoor air pollution from gas based appliances or wood burning cookers or heaters. Millions more suffer because of this without dying.
2) 150 million innocent animals are murdered in the meat industry every day, something that would also ideally go out the window in order to fix the climate crisis (which for the sake of this we're calling bollocks) due to it being a massive waste of crops and a massive source of methane pollution, not to mention the working conditions in meat packing or the sucides from that, or the fact that many holocaust victims went vegan because they saw too many similarities in their genocide as in the genocide of other living beings.
3) Then of course there's the ever imminent threat that your car blows up or your cooker blows up or your plane blows up and on and on because they're all powered by highly combustible fuels that are incredibly dangerous for precisely the same reason they are useful.
4) Finally, though I haven't run out of reasons I thought I'd finish anyway, there's the conservation consideration. With so many animals (humans included) dying because of deforestation for logging (for paper pulp, palm oil, logs for wood, rubber, and so on) and farming, surely that's something you'd also want to stop and reverse on its own merits.

When you face up to the fact that, climate change or not, we are presiding over a culture of destruction and death, and that many of the fixes are also what's viable to solve climate change if it exists (it does and this is not a matter of scientific debate even if it's a matter of debate among internet weirdos, despite my earlier concession to humour the idea), I don't see what you've got to complain about.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we cant keep emitting CO2 as we are.  But we will.   Energy consumption is fundamental to capitalism and greed.  No amount of renewable resources will make up for our insatiable energy & resource needs (food, minerals, oils, plastics, etc.).  Although I applaud the kids for standing up, I doubt they understand the real implication for turning our lifestyles around.  
Will they for example give up: 
their phones - made out of heavy and rear metals, consume energy, large parts not recycled, made in foreign countries then shipped to where they needed,
social media - needs energy and chemical metals (computers) to function, 
abundance of food & produce - mostly imported or transported over large distances, wrapped in plastic, responsible for large part of pollutants & deforestation, 
their reliance on cars (sure they don‚Äôt drive, but they also don‚Äôt like to walk, they )
holidays - driving, flying, encouraging more need for holiday accomodation in exotic places of natural beauty resulting in more destruction and need for resources.  
Easy & cheap entertainment - music bands, movie makers & stars traveling across the globe with enormous amount of equipment
Changing fashion - to keep up with new trends and what their ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù & stars are ‚Äúselling‚Äù to them
Have children - yes this of controversial, but can we really sustain our current life styles and energy consumption if our population grows to 11 billion (Hans Grosling prediction based on each couple having 2 children)? 

Simple answer: No, they won‚Äôt give up any of the above, neither will their parents, nor their politicians.  They need to understand the entire problem (it‚Äôs not just climate change).  Climate change is link to a global economy.  They need to take real action first - and no, protesting is not taking action, they themselves have to stop or massively reduce consumption, they need to question every action you take and look at what impact it has.  Failing to do so and you are guilty of the same offences that the grownups, politicians and business capitalists make: that‚Äôs then just hypocrisy.  

It‚Äôs very easy to preach, make accusations that adults don‚Äôt take action - even though they are right.  When they themselves do not take real action.  Traveling by plane and staying in fancy hotels to make a speech to politicians about climate issues (whether you a kid or adult or Greta Thunberg) is just implicating yourself, showing how ignorant you are.  You just become like them.  What happened to video recorded messages or a life link.  But no, we have to go to spread our ‚Äúmessage‚Äù and take a stance.  What they don‚Äôt realise, they are now part of the problem because no one can pass up the opportunity to be important or famous.  You see, Greta Thunberg is a perfect example of this.  She is massively inspirational in what she achieved and her ability to so eloquently speak in public.  However (not to criticise her), in standing up for what she believes, she became a spoke person for children across the world, she receives recognition and one thing leads to another and before she knew it, she was traveling across the world, stays in fancy hotels, all paid for by the very people she criticises.  It pains to say it,  but fortunately she is also not mature enough to understand the implication of taking real action.  Hopefully she will grow in her understanding of these issues, but the risk is she will get sucked in by fame and fortune in the name of standing up for climate change, she too will be consumed by capitalism and consumerism.  

Talk is cheap, protests are fun.  They give a false sense of achievement.  Giving up on our comforts and all consuming lifestyles is really really hard, even impossible.",0.0,1.0,,sBFdLcNYjb0,

What did that do for the environment?    My guess is take a 10,000 or more tons of trash out of their own local communities and ecosystems and do something measurable positive that many others will follow in doing as well.

I worry about the ""too little, too late"" possibility the point at which some already feel we've reached, but we haven't.  With emergency action on the part of the world's highest greenhouse gas emitting countries, we could put a significant dent in the problem.  The most modern, industrialized countries emit a disproportionate amount of CO2, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere versus the rest of the world and obviously serious action on the part of these countries will make the most significant difference.

So will we do it?  I remain skeptical but not hopeless.  I do believe the world will move to taking serious action to try to deal with Global Warming at some point in the future but that the point isn't likely to be in the next couple of years.   So is it guaranteed to be ""too little, too late"" if we finally move into emergency mode say about a decade from now?

But if you measure ecosystem change and greenhouse gases, and model the results of those changes, it's very obvious that the planet is much degraded in these terms, and that continuing to raise GHGs will produce increasingly serious effects. I guess you are a 'lukewarmer': you agree the Earth is warming but don't agree with the modelling showing that the effects of that will be pretty bad, potentially catastrophic, and eventually irreversible. The idea that just as many scientists agree with you as with the mainstream opinion that it is vital to stay below about 2C is frankly laughable at this point. The IPCC represents median, conservative, scientific opinion. There is a significant risk that things will turn out worse than that.

The examples you give of people getting things wrong is not usually scientists, or is misrepresented as a prediction when in fact it was a worst-case possibility. Obviously there have been a few incorrect predictions by scientists, but they remain unusual and do not in any way undermine the mainstream. The 5-20 foot sea level rise is _by 2100_ not now, for example, unless you can find the paper or quote predicting that by 2020? I expect a similar caveat goes for your 'midwest desert' prediction example, but I don't know about that.

Yes, and being there is an equally great number of scientist saying their views and claims are not exactly as they claim or believe (who have not been proven wrong by nature and the passage of time itself)  tends to make me want to adhere to a far more pragmatic and stoic approach to this given too often those screaming doom and gloom, who did get their way, made things far worse, not better.

I do recall peak oil predictions being made and being wrong.  I do remember the prediction we could not produce enough food and that, subsequently, being proven wrong via the Green Revolution (at least for now).  Sure, I get why there is a lot of doubts about climate change and its eventual impacts too.  But that's just it: climate change isn't a single prediction!  It's a series of very serious interrelated predictions, each which might be catastrophic on their own and collectively which are nothing short of horrific.

So are you suggesting the solution then is to ""wait and see"" if they are right on the most serious predictions?  Then, I guess, if they are deal with it as it comes?  I don't get that.  Isn't the entire point of science to peer into the future via prediction rather than respond to the present so we can act before it's too late?  You talk about a big conspiracy of journalists and social movements, but I place trust not in the protesters or writers of dystopian futures here.  I don't care what they say.    I place trust in the vast multitudes of scientists that are telling us that we are seeing NOW is exactly as predicted we would see in the beginning, and it'll get far worse if we don't respond now.  For example, the globe is experiencing a very strong uptick of floods and fires worldwide as well as HEMISPHERIC-LEVEL heat waves!  How can you doubt this as the reports pour in month after month?  

No matter if you think they are being exaggerated, these things are happening now and costing billions, and as they increase, just as predicted they will, you have to assume people will stop paying attention to those that, like yourself it seems, are saying let's wait and see.

I do think the right is rapidly coming to this conclusion, and I believe Trump is the last gasp of a dying breed of the GOP in-so-far as climate change.  If the GOP wants to make business in the future prosper as it has under fossil fuels, addressing climate change and the demise of our civilization if we continue using it make sense.  Their last-ditch effort to confuse this matter was to discount the reality of unchecked climate change is our demise.  But this attempt to spread confusion is becoming and will continue to become, more absurd with each doubling of wildfires, each state crippled by drought and water shortages, each time our crops fail, as millions push on our borders for refuge from dead lands, etc.  So while this might be slightly more viewed as more a concern of the left today, I think that will totally change in five to ten years.

The aesthetic of science is & has been manipulated to peddle nonsense both in mainstream & fringe scientific discourses, and the methodology of science, even if correctly used, has been manipulated to absurd conclusions. I'd argue any field or organisation trying to make truth claims will eventually be undermined by someone intentionally or otherwise talking shite and then things will unravel badly from there, just because of the popular conception (which in some ways is necessary for important things like healthcare and not dumping toxic waste everywhere) of science as the ultimate arbiter on truth.

From the BS about vaccines causing autism, the medicalisation of being gay, & the anti-transgender fake diagnosis ROGD (thankfully corrected or retracted by the respective journals, and retracted by the DSM in the case of gay folks, though the damage has been done already and continues to be done) back to the ""racial science"" of the transatlantic slave trade & Nazi Germany (& that sadly sees revival today in the modern Fascist movements), not to mention the ongoing mess that is the DSM medicalising anything it can think of. Of course, how could I forget the nonsense written about women, their wombs bouncing around their bodies, and vibrators being a treatment for hysteria (itself used as a justification for denying women the right to vote on the basis of their gender).

Even if I appreciate the value of lived experience and 1st hand accounts in determining what's true (which honestly everyone should, unless you're going to start doubting that your mate had toast for breakfast), I wouldn't say I lack appreciation for scientific methodologies, or the discoveries that have made many folks lives easier, or the difficulty of the work of many scientists, or the difficulties they have in navigating and working in their respective fields (don't get me started on how academic publishing is essentially one big scam based on the unpaid labour of millions of hard working people that wouldn't have this problem if their practice wasn't run capitalistically); so in that way I would *like it* if the far left got to claim science as its own.

The USA is facing virtual universal & vociferous opposition on this from all her (now former) allies - Except from Saudi & Russia (surprise surprise), & even they have signed up to Paris..  
The deal was set up to be extremely loose, so that individual countries can implement it in any way they wish - This was at the insistence of the US.

Link: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014

By the graph, it seems like the U.S. has been wiggling around 6,500 ""emission"" units since the 90s. There was a significant drop but, only after a gradual increase with a peak in 2007 or so. Not to mention, there doesn't seem to be any other significant drop that has placed us back at the low of 91. What do you mean by ""past years,"" exactly? Thank you for your input, btw. I appreciate people that voice their opinions without insults. Do you believe we're keeping our emissions within this range and is such a range safe? Do we have to drop lower to keep our environment good?

One thing that is definitely suggested by this is that the U.S. certainly has not increased in emissions over these years and has not played a major role in the contribution to the rising CO2 output. Check this graph:
Link: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data

The U.S. has been wiggling but the emissions steeply increased not as a direct result of the U.S. Still, U.S. isn't entirely off the hook because the European Union still contributes 6% less than the U.S. does.

The biggest question though, should we help out China and the other nations to decrease their emissions? I understand what you're saying, John. U.S. gotta look out for the U.S. but if we join the Agreement, there's a political statement being made that the U.S. hopes for a ""greener"" world  (I don't want hotter summers).

I might add that the importance of the deal didn't lie in its clauses, since it actually leaves a great margin of freedom to every country on how to meet its goals, but in the great symbolic value of the whole world coming together. Pulling out of the agreement won't have any positive consequences for the US, you won't save any money (since you've already signed the Cancun treaty and the Copenhagen treaty on climate change, which actually do set some strict and legally binding clauses that you will need to meet) nor you won't save any jobs.

Vote for leaders who will fight climate change by:

-Supporting a price on carbon

I see all these idiots, including DiCaprio just so you know, who jump on a bandwagon of ignorance, and doing nothing for the environment - in fact harm.
What if we focused on the real environmental problems?  Salt in the water table (from leather tanning), chemicals dumped into the environment to process rare earths for solar panels and wind generators (see Lake BaoTou), carcinogens in our GMO fertilizers and foods, etc.?  Those are the real problems.  CO2 is not even close to a problem except for one thing:  We don't have enough of it in the atmosphere.
I care about the environment and it bugs the hell out of me that this has turned into a fraudulent money making scheme, which ultimately takes resources away from a clean environment.

There is zero science that says human activities impact climate change.  And frankly right now there is no global warming.

Al Gore and Maurice Strong have said in emails there is no science, but yet it would still be useful (con) to have something for the people to rally around.  Their words, not mine.
The purpose of this global warming scam has always been about money.  Now perfected by Obama.  Carbon is in just about everything and now they are going to tax the carbon content of everything - even your pumpkins (not your head but the kind that grows out of the ground).  Tens of trillions of dollars ripped out of our pockets on this global warming fraud and sent.... Where?  Oh yes.  Not into clean energy.  Nope.  Into the pockets of the traders.  The bankers.  The folks that will securities decades of tax collection and trade it and pocket probably about 75% of it.

The issue of global warming, that so many people would like nothing more than to ignore, has gradually been increasing in its destruction for decades now, and still everything is up in the air, so to speak. As much as I am glad that so much light has been shed upon this issue, how do we know that our planet will be sustained and protected in time?¬†
How can we deny what is unfolding before us? How can we refuse to believe in something that has already killed thousands and thousands of people? I am a Christian, and even I can see that denying climate change is no longer right. The facts have been clearly stated. The effects have occurred time and time again. So, why do we ignore it? 

We as a human race, are destructive and greedy. This very fact blatantly stains the pages of history. I know we cannot change, but I hope we can learn, and grow as a world so we can face the problems we have caused and unite together to solve them.¬†
Mr DiCaprio, I applaud you. You may face the scrutiny of people who call you a Hollywood hypocrite (when they, in many ways, are also hypocrites), but you have been working on the issue of global warming for almost 20 years and your passion, determination and compassion for the cause has led so many people to look within their own lives and try to find ways in which they can contribute to fixing the virtually impossible.

""The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.‚Äù This is just one example from Revelations 11:18. The destroyers of the earth are those who have wasted the resources of the world God created for us and continue to waste them despite the many indications of global warming the destruction of our earth. But, what about from another part of the Bible? ""‚ÄúAs for you, my flock, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats. Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?"" This is Ezekiel 34:17-18. God is asking why we must covet for things we don't have and destroy things around us when we have so much to sustain us, and so much to give to others to sustain them. As a Chrsitian, I believe that it is God who created the Earth and created each and every living thing within it in His image. He created his Earth so that we could flourish and live a prosperous life. But, since Adam and Eve, we as humans have been easily deceived and look at where it has brought is. I'll admit that these Bible verses I have given you can easily by perceived differently, but this is the way I have interpreted them. Good day to you.
