For all their pretensions, they are also viciously vindictive intolerant bullies as well - traits they share with their Radical Leftist (Leninist/Stalinist/Maoist..... et a Communistl) cousins. It has also helped them overcome any doubts, tide over any moral or ethical concern to form a close alliance with the Islamofascists. Islamo-Gauachisme, as the French call it, has pseudo-liberals, cultural Marxists and other members of the Regressive Left enthusiastically playing the favourite ""voluntary useful idiots"" of the Islamists across the civilsed world ie. 'Open Societies' within functional Democracies of the world. Islamo-Gauachisme has been a global phenomenon atleast since the beginning of the last century. Although there is no place for the Regressive Left in the _not so_ civilsed Islamic & Communist world (both go after and exterminate the Regressive Left like pests as brutally and as quickly as possible within their domain). It is also the best example of (pseudo) Liberal & Left's brazen hypocricy devoid of any shame, scruples or goodwill whatsoever. Another good example being the fact that genuine, stable and long-lasting social welfare schemes run by the State which the Left touts as its most important USP, can be sustained only by Free Market economy which it denounces as greatest evil to inflict mankind!! All that endless virtue signalling which the pseudo-liberals and Left in general indulge in rampantly, is indeed borne out of exactly what Prof. Peterson points out at in the video. It is also a convenient mask to wear while masquerading as genuinely empathetic people operating in good faith.",UC9Y4sjhBdkqZYL1TGERyUcA,1,UgwxbWXUZ1oUPO71UNd4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Do you understand that there will always be people in power, and they have to do things to maintain that power? Because if they don't, someone else will take it? Chaos is not a workable system in societies with 10s to 100s of millions of people. Throughout the history of civilization, the vast majority of people have been quite poor, often desperately so. That is no longer the case in the modern developed world, largely thanks to the industrial revolution and Enlightenment principles. In the smaller, ethnically homogeneous nations they even have comprehensive social welfare - incredible! In the developed world things are really good, regardless of what people tell you. Yes, there is an elite that is constantly trying to consolidate and expand its power - welcome to humanity! Yes, humans are inherently tribal. These are features, not bugs, of our species.

Therefore, individuals must do better in their own lives, increasing their skill sets and competencies in order to have a healthy collective that is FAR more capable and fit to create change than you had before'.

And we ignore the primary issues at the individual level. Self improvement. Self reflection. A locus of internal control.

He gave advice and very clear words to maybe make different approaches on personal building before you bring flawed concepts to a table due to the inability to differentiate moral stand points. Meaning those who can't accept personal flaw or responsibility can't even begin to put proper responsibility or moral standing elsewhere. It's basic human psychology. Because in most terms once something puts any inkling of doubt or question into their methods then ultimately that person is wrong and needs to listen to them and not any possibilities they may have. She can't even accept a simple talk and use any of it to apply and make herself think. Like every person in that nature she shrugs it off like it's another white man speaking to her who shouldn't be.

You can’t stop a person from being a rapist, murderer or such and you may try employ certain tactics and actions to mitigate but that’s as far as you can go without forcefully stepping on the freedom of others. You aren’t going to stop humanity from producing murderers, all you can do is worry about what you are doing with your life and perhaps find solace in doing your part without forcing others to also do what you want. Try to find the good in yourself and be the change you want to see happen.

He analysed the person's reasoning process, rather than refreshing his intellect to decipher the question in a completely different way. Which unfortunately, proved her statement about banal statements. It's unoriginal. He could have proven his ability instead, to flex his intellectual capacity, beyond the status quo. I suspect Peterson doesn't have an answer though, and that's why he deflects onto others, for their perceived unreasonable responses. A man with his intelligent, should never consider employing Pee-wee Herman's stance of, ""I know you are, but what am I"". He took the energy to cross examine the individual who asked the question, rather than examine the actual question. Not a very effective listener, if he feels the need to reconstruct their logic to decipher the answer, he wanted them to give all along. He could have approached it another way: ""I'm interested in hearing what you think is the best way forward, that you have identified. I'll share the pros and cons of that strategy, and let you make up your own mind. Because I still believe a structured approach, starting with the little things, leads to solving the bigger things."" That way he's not compromising his original position, but willing to engage in discussions about different strategies. The fact he just shut her down like that though, demonstrates he has little faith in people. It may be one of the dangers of his profession though.

I heard ppl call it the authentic self.(I am aware that this is a journey untill your death and an incredible Hard one too.) While you are finding out Who you are, you have recognise all the good and Bad you are carrieng in your SELF and try to convert those atributes of your SELF into actual tools that move your world to a place, which you would concider as a better one. (I think messuring ""better"" is really hard as well, but as Dr. Peterson says, luckly we have some collective values(like the 10 commandmens in the Bibel) which you can use as a beacon of ""good"" Or ""better"") If you do that and ""use"" your SELF to move to something good. People might won't like you, but they will respect you and will appreciate your SELF. What is even better about this, is the fact that now, the People who will like you, are acctually people you want to have around your SELF.

I don't disagree that some people agree purely selfish and need to be kept in check. However that is up to the people who know what they are doing, and if you start mopping them floors one day even you might know what you are doing.

Not that we needed much help, but that has been the general trend. The contributors to this are many and varied, but I think most of us would agree on the premise. This leads to a very visceral, personal, and high level sense of narcissism. Little Suzie, in the deep recesses of her psyche, really does see herself as mommy's little snowflake princess. 2) When faith in a higher power is removed from a society, they inevitably become humanists, which is to say they -often subconsciously- worship humanity as the greatest force or power in the universe. Therefore, it is, in itself worthy of praise. This leads to a deep, foundational type of kind of narcissism. We / I can control everything! Compile the two and you get a massive ego trip where everyone is always right -i.e. ""YOUR"" truth is a thing- Feelings come first, and grown-assed adults embrace the concept of cry closets and so-called safe spaces. Not to mention that most of us become ideologues so married to our beliefs that no amount of reason or evidence can persuade us we could possibly be wrong.

His words are not elitist in the slightest they are empowering to the masses, inspiring them to try harder and to rise above their past selves. If you think that's elitist you clearly have a poor definition of the word bouncing around in that skull of yours. Of course... those who don't want to take responsibility for themselves and change for the better will naturally hate Jordans words because to the unwilling mind, the words sting like saltwater on a wound, painful but ultimately good for you. (not that those sad sad people stung by it will accept it...)

Yes, it may be hard to discern between what's a real threat and what is just simple panic and hysteria. But for the moment, imagine you were born in 1900 not 1990. On your 14th birthday, World War I starts, and ends on your 18th birthday. 22 million people perish in that war. Later in the year, a Spanish Flu epidemic hits the planet and runs until your 20th birthday. 50 million people die from it in those two years. Yes, 50 million. On your 29th birthday, the Great Depression begins. Unemployment hits 25%, the World GDP drops 27%. That runs until you are 33. The country nearly collapses along with the world economy. When you turn 39, World War II starts. You aren't even over the hill yet. And don't try to catch your breath. On your 41st birthday, the United States is fully pulled into WWII. Between your 39th and 45th birthday, 75 million people perish in the war. Smallpox was an epidemic until you were in your 40's, as it killed 300 million people during your lifetime. At 50, the Korean War starts. 5 million perish. From your birth, until you are 55 you dealt with the fear of Polio epidemics each summer. You experience friends and family contracting polio and being paralyzed and/or die. At 55 the Vietnam War begins and doesn't end for 20 years. 4 million people perish in that conflict. During the Cold War, you lived each day with the fear of nuclear annihilation. On your 62nd birthday you have the Cuban Missile Crisis, a tipping point in the Cold War. Life on our planet, as we know it, almost ended. When you turn 75, the Vietnam War finally ends. Think of everyone on the planet born in 1900. How did they endure all of that? If you were a kid in 1985 you may have thought your 85-year-old grandparent didn't understand how hard school was. And how mean that kid in your class was. Yet they survived everything listed above. Perspective is an amazing and valuable gift. Refined and enlightening as time goes on. Let's try to keep things in perspective. Your parents and/or grandparents were called upon to endure all of the above. Today we are being called upon to stay home, wash our hands frequently.

That's well and good, but the question is unanswered. It presumes that a person who wants to participate in larger issues are escaping their own personal ones, in an absolute sense. Secondly, it alludes to people having individual flaws are to be barred from participating in the dialogue of larger issues, despite them being part of it. Furthermore, nobody is excluded from flaws of seeking improvement, so to what extent should you ""fix"" yourself before you should then participate? The question is also not limited to her and her alone. It's an open forum, so one expects the recognition that the entire audience in the studio and at home will view it. Presuming all conditions are met, how should one meaningful achieve any sort of influence of in decision making of larger issues? It remains unanswered.

Peterson's point threatens to dispel the illusion her ego depends on, the one where she is a Righteous Dude Saving The Planet. It helps her avoid facing all the problems and failures of her personal life, so she does not appreciate Peterson's attempt to make her face herself in the mirror. She already knows what she will see, and her mental health is now dependent on denying what she sees.

Have you even read his book? He's articulating self-help in his own manner and it is evidently incredibly successful. I've seen millions of comments of people thanking JBP for getting their life in order from their lowest points. I feel as though you don't understand the principles of self-help: it's simple yes, but very difficult to put into place and maintain. Peterson's obviously been very successful in how he has articulated his self-help messages. As I said, his 'simplistic' response to climate change is the actually perfect example of how following discipline and self-help principles can create change. None of the people who helped create climate solutions were dysfunctional in their lives as you'll find it's incredibly difficult to change the world, if you can't keep your room in order. So basically, if you're a protestor who have their own life in disarray what chances are you seriously giving yourself to solve the world's problems. Again, in the video Peterson has no objection to protestors or collective groups - he's simply insisting that if you genuinely want to create change, look to your own life first to give you experience to build your competencies. Again, you're making a huge generalisation. Peterson is anything but an elite - he's built his own platform and rebelled against the CHRC and UoT's ridiculous lines of thinking. He's never said anything in the slightest that all rich people were personally responsible. He doesn't use this idea to dig at the poor, but instead to encourage anyone regardless of class to be more competent in their lives. His messages aren't directed at any particular group at all. This is a huge problem with his critics concerning self-help: you're not meant to take his ideas literally. When he says to 'slay the dragon' he doesn't mean it in a literal sense and 'keeping your house in order' doesn't mean your house should always be in perfect shape. I'm gonna sound harsh but the women who questioned Jordan honestly does deserve to be criticised. If she has the capacity to put herself out there and insult JBP you deserve what’s coming. The way she acted and presented herself (she also has a 'Victorian Socialist' party badge which says something) is a dead giveaway that she's likely very dysfunctional and is in no place to hurl insults in a forum that is meant for questions that aren't loaded. I'm not condoning every single comment on here, but when you put yourself out there, you need to take what comes. It's not the end of the world seeing a few nasty comments, considering Peterson has been receiving death threats for the past few years. I read your point saying why does his followers always use buzzwords like destroyed. Firstly, that's a very small amount of his followers (who are likely conservative and ignoring the rest of his message of being open minded). Secondly, if you're just reading Youtube and Reddit comments you probably aren't looking in the right places for insightful analysis. And finally, he doesn't have any bearing over the way his 'followers' interact online - you're not responsible for your audience in the first place.",UC9HZ_AVcJ27Zb2Nup2QZLZg,1,Ugw1rT6m_As8rUk2QqJ4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

If you believe that we humans ascended slowly from the lowest life-forms to our present condition, whereas other species remained 'stuck' more or less in that original condition, you believe in a fairytale. I have heard wonderful but improbable tales told by 'scientists' such as the following: -that manatees crawled out of their original aquatic environment to live on land, and then returned 'en masse' to the sea -that fossils of MARINE creatures found high in the Andes mountains are 'proof' of slow sedimentary deposition across aeons, rather than of a universal Flood (figure that one out if you can). So then, a fairytale is in the eye of the beholder. Your vision needs correction. You fail to realize that your ideology is faith-based. But your faith is exercised toward a different object or set of objects. How does your faith address questions of morality, or justice, or mercy, or SIN? SIN (hamartia) is 'missing the mark', a certain lack of integrity. We all suffer from it and cause others to suffer at the same time. JESUS came, died, and rose in REAL TIME and REAL SPACE to address this problem.

One thing though the "" let people be"" was I think more inspired by the irritation I was feeling about all the insulting comments being made about the woman on this thread than it was by Peterson himself. My main criticism of Peterson is that I find his"" personal responsibility"" thing to be too simplistic. Of course we all have to be responsible for ourselves but one of the most personally responsible things we can do is to organise together to try to solve problems which are obviously way beyond the scope of our personal abilities to solve. All of that is obvious. Peterson acts like he just had the idea of "" personal responsibility "" for the first time in history. The real question is how best to organise together and what should the solutions be. This or these are the questions which Peterson ducks or fails to address with his "" personal responsibility "" panacea . It is also heartless, and useful to the elites, in my opinion, cuz it contains the implication that the poor are poor and the rich are rich cuz the latter have been more "" personally responsible "".

Life is difficult, but I can guarantee you the millions of people who have incorporated the advice of Peterson and other self help figures have made their own lives and others much better. You're effectively saying he shouldn't have responded to her question because it would have challenged her warped view. Peterson basically provided the way to solve the climate issue. Looking at all the great innovators and leaders who brought the climate issue in public view - I'm pretty sure every single one of them were functional human beings who metaphorically had their house in order to allow them to have the discipline and motivation to propose solutions and evidence. And every consumer who have reduced their carbon footprint looked at their own consumption and made change, instead of spending their time being virtuous to others.

Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.' Jesus did not want to be crucified. He prayed that, if possible, He might be delivered, adding however, 'not My will, but Thine be done.' He Who alone was perfect among us showed the greatest humility.

About climate change? I’m sorry but that was NOT the question posed by either Larkin or the host. The question posed by both her and the host was in response to Peterson’s views, that we ought to “clean our rooms” AKA individual responsibility. Larkin states that individual responsibility is not enough to address climate change. Peterson states that individual responsibility CANNOT be sacrificed to address climate change. Therefore he believes that this “existential crisis” that you stated about climate change is not something that we can cast aside our personal responsibilities in favor of political and collective action.

Calling her a SJW is reasonable because SJW tend to ad hominem their intellectual opponents, which she clearly did. Additionally, SJWs believe in social justice, who are very much proponents of emphasizing collective responsibility over individual responsibility. Finally, Peterson did not dodge the question asking whether collective responsibility is more important than individual responsibility when it comes to addressing climate change. He directly answers that collective responsibility is not more important in this context, which means that we cannot forgo our responsibility to our individual life over coming together to fix climate change . For example we ought to become more competent and powerful individuals rather than calling on others, I.e. masses or groups in power like political government to address the problem of climate change.",UCGHg5hetCV0hhgEZI73LldQ,1,Ugz8GIFln8Z-ZLCf4nd4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Yeah u may be right on jp’s career influencing his contentions. In fact, maslow’s hierarchy of needs (as a theory) may have been his basis. Social movement is something identified somewhere between belongingness up to transcendence, while personal responsibility entails from physiological to safety and security (the theory implies that u have to meet ur physiologic needs before going up to the higher levels such as loving and belongingness). I have things to clarify though so I can say we r on the same lens: we can operationally define ideology as a system that forwards a political theory and policy. I argued that the person identifies himself as part of the social action, instead of social action just being admired/like “self-interested” without consideration to veil of ignorance. It is true that both are ideologies, but the latter may lead to the former, but not the other way around, instead u sacrifice yourself without regard to the latter. So I say that arbitrary line may be needed in order to sustain the cause of collective responsibility. So I am not sure where adequacy of both ideologies cannot supersede the other. In any case, I am saying that the individual takes power in identifying himself, rather than the movement identifying the individual (a personal choice/autonomy should happen). It is true that you cannot solve personal problems on you own, but responsibility is defined as a duty to be accountable on something. I mean it seems to be an excuse when someone cannot fulfill his duties and responsibilities, leading to his acts to contribute to the global problem (slippery slope). Though I agree that being part of a certain movement boosts your morale to be responsible, it does not on its own instill the needed virtues to sustain the cause, in fact when the group dissolves indefinitely in the future, it may lead the members to not continue To stay true to their actions. Again if we argue that we cant single out these two things, it’s another problem; coz handling two things at the same time cause opposition (one may go against the other), no negotiation and absence of a system. Plus, it does not just dissipate the other entity, but only comes secondary when prioritizing. Though I know, a capitalist society makes it very hard to take personal responsibility as the econpmically well persons seem to abuse power (which makes social action very appealing - but still I propose that indiv responsibility should be reinforced first, even with coll action, but the coll action should be improved when at least physiologic needs are already tolerable/part of QoL/DALY). Lez come to think of it, a marginalized person can choose to support his needs (family) and/or be part of this certain movement that advances some program for their finances. Being part of the movement, he supports this in many ways as possible. Then a certain action of the group goes against to one of his personal virtues/values/security needs, he unreliably dismember himself + same happens when the group itself disbands. When he is not already a member, he may think that he ahould not do anything part of this cause since he is not already part of the collective identity. However when he chooses to become virtuous and responsible, he is actually free and not coerced by any externality/circumstance to join in a certain social movement. When that social movement dissolved, most like he ia still continuing to actualize actions faithful to the cause. Abusive individuals who does not make this possible is another issue, in this case it is already sovereign right and responsibility of all members of the state to organize and advance a grievance effort. I hope you get my point, but I do understand your points. I am happy that you responded to me well and with wise thoughts. I am willing to make changes in my worldview as necessary, or when inconsistencies become so evident.",UCAVantEt_3n8waFlHUJbycg,1,Ugz8GIFln8Z-ZLCf4nd4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

What seems to be mistaken in collective action argument is that it supersedes the former. It disregards the importance of prioritizing first the primary problem/cause (however multivariate it is), jumping off to a widespread resolution. I hope what you see here is sustainability, collective action will only reliably boost solving a complex issue like climate change when at least 90% of individuals understand the ideology, instead of being consumed by the mere movement. The problem with the query made by the girl (using girl just to point out what I can perceive in the video, I have no idea what she wants to be called or referred with a pronoun- see the problem of c16? Hrd to identify without confined terms, this is a digression btw) is that she asks for an opinion/advice which implicates a lot as a political statement. If the question is formulated in a way that asks for an objective response that clarifies the importance of individual and collective responsibility per se it could have been elaborated. In JP’s view, I think he was wrong in at asking a rhetoric - which could have been perceived by the public as something offensive, but meant as a way to reassess her thoughts . Nonetheless, the point of him asking that denotes more on historical elements which emphasizes that this has been a long and persistent issue, coming into previous futile responses to the problem.",UCAVantEt_3n8waFlHUJbycg,1,Ugz8GIFln8Z-ZLCf4nd4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

I mean to point out that there exists a significant force--what one might call a ""market force""--that tends towards sustainability and conservation in energy use, and allowing things to develop as they will, with minimum gov't involvement, is ideal (see: Germany, but contra: France). As with anything you can depend on an individual to take more for less if he can. I'm not sure how great this Linkola guy is-- as soon as we start talking about ""too many humans"" it crosses an ethical boundary that I find unacceptable. What, shall you decide who gets a refrigerator; who deserves to live well or live like dirt (or not live at all)? If not you, then who will decide? Me? Linkola? Asking developing nations to form their own committees to decide it themselves? The only moral option is an individually-based one-- if an African has the money to buy it then buy it he shall-- as their numbers dwindle, the price rises, putting the pressure on for innovation. Or perhaps modern day fridges are the best we'll ever get, and the result will be a global fridge ownership pattern similar to our current day's. I am certain we will find that war, famine, disease, etc. will wipe out swathes before a big tidal wave does. War and the rest are terrible things, but I would prefer that to, uh, some guy presiding over his country and deciding X Y and Z types of people shouldn't exist so much....and anyways, individuals actually do make decisions as to number of kids based on the resources available to them (duh).

I admittedly take this from the very practical citation my Dad would always tell me about from the fire service, if you're in a burning building and trying to rescue someone and you get injured/incapacitated then not only are you not helping anyone else but you're additionally another problem that everyone else needs to take on, this is why they're taught to not take needless risks, the principle still applies here, you simply aren't going to be very well equipped to help anyone else with their problems if you can't deal with your own first (or actively need others to help you with them).

To say you'd be skeptical of me would be an understatement. No, you should start small, build yourself up, get your own life in order and strengthen yourself as a person before you start trying to influence the world around you, of course the problem with that is that most people want instant gratification, hence why the common call of a mob is 'When do we want it?

This pattern continues expanding outward in exponentially larger influential waves and within 4-5 degrees of separation the world has improved and the problems, becoming self-evident, have solved themselves. Obviously thats a significantly simplified version of what an entire book could be written to explain but that’s essentially the ideology. Change on a large scale Must start close at hand.

This situation seems to be the opposite - you are abandoning smaller tasks in order to tackle the big ones. The main problem with this is that you are abandoning tasks you can actually complete for tasks that are waaaaay out of your personal control. A person, who is barely able to sustain themselves, most likely will have nothing to contribute in solving such a huge problem.

However, the underlying philosophy that a person operates from is more distinctly left or right. The left is driven by thinking in terms of collective identity. The right is driven by a belief in individual responsibility. The common consensus previously held in the US/UK/Canada was that the individual was what mattered. There were those who disagreed to be sure, however they were a distinct minority. The old left wanted greater collective action, greater regulation, and higher taxes; but they did not differ in their belief in the individual as the ultimate identity. Today, collectivist thinking has dramatically expanded in both academic and cultural institutions. Ergo, there has been a change in the underlying philosophy held by people on the left. Their default understanding of the wold is now collectivist rather and individualistic. If Peterson's crusade of personal responsibility doesn't seem political to you, it's because you're operating under the old paradigm.

The left/right divide essentially boils down to collectivism/individualism. If you're a collectivist, ""your"" house and ""your"" problems and ""your"" mess are really the collective's house, problem, and mess. Therefore others owe you the labor necessary to clean ""your"" room. Of course, while everyone in the collective feels entitled to the labor of others, most don't feel obligated to put in a surplus of labor to aid the collective - after all, the point of the collective is to aid the weak and most people can find some reason to identify themselves a weak in some way. What's more, because the collective is rooted in a drive for equality, expecting some to put in a labor surplus becomes immoral even if it can be coerced. Conversely, if responsibility rests with the individual there will need to be incentives and pressures to compel individual achievement. These incentives and pressures will create inequality and discomfort. An individualist accepts that as a reality. However, inequality is incompatible with collectivization. Further, discomfort is a form of harm, and the ability to be harmed indicates a weakness, therefore a collectivist will expect discomfort to be alleviated by collective action aimed at protecting the weak. Since the ultimate form of the collective is the government, the collectivists will bring the perspective described above to their political organizations. Meanwhile individualists will do the same when they organize parties opposing collectivization. As a result, ""get your house in order"" is inescapably political.",UCLADGDfn8InVz7bDP6-RwYQ,1,Ugxi60_1DWAPOxdMWjV4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

But nobody respects you when they walk into your house and it’s a disaster.

Do you have a relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christ? (1st Timothy 2:5) 'For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.' Do you '... confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead'? If these things are so, then according to the remaining clause of Romans 10:9, 'YOU WILL BE SAVED.' Your life has a chance of becoming 'ordered', because your heart will be essentially in alignment with the TRUTH. (Obviously we are not speaking of earthly perfection here. 'If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us'-------------1st John 1:8.) (Psalm 50:23) 'He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; and to him who ORDERS [his way] aright I shall show the salvation of God.' So true 'orderliness' cannot be detached from GODLINESS. Understand this! I HOPE THAT THIS IS THE CASE with you. Naturally I do not know your situation. But if anyone REFUSES to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and REJECTS His authority, that person CANNOT be said to lead an 'ordered life', but rather a DISORDERED one. For SIN has various aspects, various connotations, among them REBELLION and LAWLESSNESS. What more profound rebellion than to defy the highest Power in the universe, even to deny His existence, as some do? 'The fool says in his heart, ""There is no God."" ' WHEN did I lend any support to marxist theory? You should know better than that, given my obvious 'angle'. WHY are you going on about this? This seems to be a tactic of diversion from the real issue, which is HUMAN ARROGANCE AND BOGUS SELF-SUFFICIENCY. (Proverbs 14:12) 'There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.' (Proverbs 3:5) 'Trust in the Lord in all your ways, and do not lean on your own understanding.'",UCFC5wRJ2NFzNa6B1sWIt_Hw,1,Ugxi60_1DWAPOxdMWjV4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

I suppose that it depends very much on the CONTEXT and SPIRIT in which it is delivered, whether to elevate another person or group, or to deride and degrade. It also matters what changes of behavior are proposed, whether these are likely to prove beneficial. Certainly the Hebrew prophets of old delivered such a message to the people of Israel, and were ignored with tragic results. Their cry was against idolatry and social injustice, ETHICAL irresponsibility if you will, NOT an appeal of the kind which the Petersons of our time might make to poor, to those deemed 'socially disadvantaged'-------------------'pull up yourselves by your bootstraps, and you will enjoy the full benefits of our common prosperity.' The Hebrew prophets never said anything like this. I think that it was understood then, and is now, that even wicked people will seek their own economic advantage!! The young lady had reasonable concerns, I think, about the limitations of human agency. Mr. Peterson was not in a mood to take these seriously. He could not answer her need for a different perspective. For the vacuity of most 'leftist' perspectives today resides in their lack of any understanding of Divine handiwork in the progress of history. Most of them are missing the central FACT of human existence, which only the Bible can elucidate. The speculative religious traditions of mankind are of no use, except perhaps as an adjunct to 'identitarian' politics, something of 'rightist' vintage which has moved over to the 'left' in recent decades.",UCFC5wRJ2NFzNa6B1sWIt_Hw,1,Ugxi60_1DWAPOxdMWjV4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Iv heard Peterson respond to similar questions much more articulately and definitively than he did here which I attribute to His sense of the young lady’s clearly adversarial demeanor, but the answer goes more or less like this: becoming cognitively strong/healthy In yourself will allow you to positively affect your sphere of influence, and those in your sphere of influence will then improve as a result of mere contact (via the morphogenetic collective field -sheldrake) and thus better the habits of themselves and so to THEIR spheres of influence. This pattern continues expanding outward in exponentially larger influential waves and within 4-5 degrees of separation the world has improved and the problems, becoming self-evident, have solved themselves. Obviously thats a significantly simplified version of what an entire book could be written to explain but that’s essentially the ideology. Change on a large scale Must start close at hand.

Whenever the convo of climate change is brought up these types only bring up info from the past 15 years or something along those lines. But you can't do that and then the government agrees with this to cover up the fact that the climate has been crazy for so long. For example the summer of 1936 the hottest year ever recorded in history. In places in Canada the temperature reached an average of 110 and 120 in the Midwest. And in the same year there were record floods that killed so many. And during this heat wave almost 80000 were killed in a week. Another example is 1921this was the second hottest year ever recorded. So many of the soft snowflakes that these points only take research from the last 2 decades is to show that they are right and then the government agrees to make them look less bad. Its all like a game to them. And people don't want to acknowledge it. Finally another big concern is that by 2100 the chance of a 7th extinction event is 20 percent and they are concerned with climate change thats been happening for 200 years.,UC1YM5TvEjQ3x5AxmSOGiMKQ,1,Ugwqgnc6As5MRH8T5bp4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

But wait a minute-those negative forces would still exist within each of those little droplets-and so,they'd be at loggerheads with the other droplets around them,and rather than working in relative harmony towards a common goal,the overall effect would be destructive,as their energy would be used in handling the negative energy coming from their immediate surroundings. So sure, you'd definitely have a Collective-but one that's Ineffective for flooding plains. Coz while each droplet was having to be focussed only on dealing with the problems caused by the unpreparedness of the other droplets,it wouldn't have any energy left over to direct towards moving itself towards the main objective(i.e.,flooding the plain).In other words,the ocean would just be sitting there, while the plain looked on bemused.",UCE62yPq1TnIYwj0qPuKIT8Q,1,Ugw4pct4g-pwuOw0Ll94AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

This is false by definition. I have already addressed this point made several times already but I'll say it again because you do not strike me as capable enough to scroll up. An ocean is made of drops. Each drop is incapable of flooding a land mass alone. It is only as a collective that the drops can flood a region. Now I can't trust you to draw a connection between my analogy so I will explain for you: An individual (the drop) can not reverse the effects of climate change (flood a region) without assistance from the collective (the ocean). You can reverse the effects of climate change without having every individual in the collective work on bettering themselves...you only need to agree on the goal and work toward that one goal. Besides that, JP CLEARLY argues a different point from what you are trying to make. He LITERALLY goes on to explain how a single person can engage in Individualism to solve climate change.

The more such individuals there are the higher the likelihood that any such collaboration or communal effort or solution will yield positive results. If a communal effort is comprised of too many individuals who do not have themselves together that drastically decreases the likelihood that their efforts will succeed and increases the likelihood that they will make things worse.

The people that wield the power that it would take to effect rapid and material change are exactly the types of individuals he is referring to: people who take personal responsibility first, and then gradually take on larger responsibilities in their chosen fields, be they climatology, physics, engineering, politics, etc. This answer is pretty clear to me; what I wonder about is your willfully argumentative, biased personal treatment of people who agree with what Dr. Peterson says, and the man himself. Do you take issue with the fact that the answer involves a generalization? It must, as we are discussing 'general', or larger-scale issues. You also seem to assign a moral value to issues of climate, and other planetary-scale processes; extinctions, some of them very comprehensive, have been happening throughout the history of our planet and contain no moral value whatever.

You dont fight climate change on day one, in your basement eating cheese-its, you would lack everything required to solve the problem (perspective, knowledge and skills). which would require some working on yourself to solve. there are steps to take in life, people with no skills and no discipline should not try and solve the biggest problems. same as you would not take medical advice from someone who is not a doctor. what he is saying is that individuals who work on themselves are bound to fix these problems because that is the organic way problems are solved. someone along the way , thinks really hard about something or sees an opportunity and finds a solution and markets that solution. it also means to take action yourself by little steps instead of looking at the insurmountable mountain that is a big problem like climate change and feeling powerless. fighting climate change can be as simple as cleaning your room and recycling your trash. Sure its not a solution but that little extra step does fight the kaos and is a positive and welcomed energy into the world. and everyday you can try and do a little more. that is what he means by working on yourself. if you goal is to fight climate change, start by what you can solve in your immediate vacinity. then work your way up.",UCvzYfhshKEI_NjrrysocDqQ,1,Ugw4pct4g-pwuOw0Ll94AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

I've mentioned this over a dozen times over the course of about 2 months so it'll be difficult to repeat once again without getting angry that you just simply wouldn't scroll up to view my responses to this very same point. Individualism is a philosophy in which the individual works to resolve personal problems. Collectivism is a philosophy in which the collective group works to resolve larger issues. JP asserts that any and every problem can be resolved by taking an individualistic approach. The lady called him out on this error of reason by pointing out several problems which cannot be resolved by Individualism. Instead of admitting his fault, JP reaffirms his position by giving a completely false and banal explanation. All I did was point this out and explain why he is wrong. It truly is a very simple concept to grasp and I am frustrated at how dumbfounded I am that his followers cannot see the obvious flaw in their logic...or maybe they CAN see it but their overinflated egos will not allow them to acknowledge this.

I began courteously and patiently pointing out that JP was erroneous despite the fact that a child should be able to see that. His die-hard followers jumped down MY throat by asserting without explanation that I was wrong and hurling insults. Imagine you are standing in front of a class of college students. One student stands up and claims that 1+1=3. All the students cheer and praise him as being highly intelligent. I point out to them that the student is wrong and explain that 1+1=2. They say I'm wrong ""because"" and that I'm a lazy sjw moron. I understand that people have pride. I understand that pride can inhibit reason and my condescension would hinder their ability to accept that what I say is true. But 1) does this make what I say false just because it hurts someone's pride? 2) if they are not adolescents then they should know not to let their pride interfere with reason. 3) it is difficult to not condescend when discussing something so obvious. 4) I find it especially frustrating that JP has said in at least 2 interviews that I've seen, that he is using the idiocy of his followers to make millions. He tells them what they want to hear REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ITS TRUE OR WHETHER OR NOT *HE* BELIEVES IT and they lap it up without applying critical thought. He gets praise and YouTube views/ subscribers from them and he gets views from idiots like me who feel compelled to inform his followers that he is no intellectual.

People are stressing out about things they cannot do much about in the present. They want to cause immediate change in their surroundings and feel good about accomplishing something, even when they are just rotting inside, and not doing anything other than march on the streets. If you take responsibility, you will find that things will improve in your surroundings, the once big issues become small. The more people take responsibility and start developing themselves with honesty, the higher the chance that the issues will get resolved. If people just jumped on things like that woman and claim that ""We need to do something right now"", the higher possibility is, is that she'll just destroy everything, without even resolving the issue. Yes we could try to work towards resolving the issue, but if your own room is not in order, just marching for something might actually be you marching for something that makes things worse, because people need to understand that they don't know everything, and to try and resolve issues, you should try and make sure that the person trying to improve things is the best version that you can be as a person (Which victimhood is actually a proof that the person's own house is not in order). If a person like this woman here were to march for a legislation that intended to ""fight global warming"" and that legislation ruined the economy and lives of millions, I can be sure that she would be unwilling to shoulder any of the responsibility.

As a person collects different perspective on life, they will come to recognise that truth has always been out in the world, unrecognised. The biggest hurdle is the Ego - the part of our minds which rejects anything that doesn't fit our rigid worldview - so we should seek to become conscious of when this happens, and ask of ourselves why it is we are rejecting something outright - is it because it is actually wrong? Or is it because it is confronting and clashed with our ingrained beliefs? The ego-mind is at all times attempting to keep us within a limited worldview.

There are plenty of studies that show that more carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more warming, and that this carbon rise is due, in part, to humanity and fossil fuels. Where the split is, is it going to be catastrophic? How come scientists predictions have been waaaaaaay off when it comes to climate change, yet we should believe them now. We should sacrifice the poor's quality of life now, to combat something that may happen in the future. How far will you suffer for a theory?

Just going on social media is an exercise in patience because I want to puke when I see the people who post 20 selfies a day and every single post is about themselves. Absolutely no self awareness of how narcissistic they're being. Back before the internet, if someone took 20 photos of themselves a day and then had them printed and went around showing them to all of their friends, you would definitely think they had a mental disorder! But now the equivalent behavior is considered perfectly acceptable. In fact, it's encouraged and rewarded! I don't understand it. I find this whole culture of self-worship and self-promotion so hollow and depressing. All I can say though is hang in there because there are still plenty of other people like us who long for more substance. I get the same sad feeling you do when I look around and see the shallowness or even sociopathic nature of some. But be thankful you're not one of the people who is so empty they require a never ending stream of attention to fill the void. They might appear happy or successful or fulfilled, but in reality they are some of the least satisfied inside. It seems to me like society is increasingly splitting into two demographics -- those who are hearing a call to seek more truth and meaning in their lives -- and those who love the illusions and embrace the lies. There are plenty of us in the first group, it's just not always as obvious because we make less of a commotion about ourselves. 😉 Just keep trying to be a good person and allow your own light to help illuminate the darkness. Put out a call to the universe to be surrounded by those who share your own depth of character.

Asking Peterson for an alternative proposal he wouldn't smear is 100% fair game.

If you really don't know where the ad hominem strawman is, if someone asks you how to fix the environmental issue ""Tidy up your room"" is an ad hominem strawman thats dodging the question. Just as it would be an ad hominem strawman if someone answered ""get a proper haircut"" to the question what you should be doing about your house thats on fire. Such an ad hominem strawman is a literal rule in Petersons book: ""Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world"" Because she knew that beforehand she basically asks if he has another answer thats not an ad hominem strawman. To which he basically just rephrases said ad hominem strawman. Which is not only intelectually dishonest, because its dodging the question.

What you need is a team of engineers who have their personal lives sorted. They need the headspace to focus on their task and not get distracted as to where their wallet is ( it’s under the pile of clothes that haven’t been put away). They need to be knowledgeable in their craft and be able to problem solve, work in a group, timeline, meet deadlines and check on the progress of others. Peterson is correct.

For example, there’s a video of him saying he wasn’t particularly educated IN a specific subject because he had “only read about 600 books” on the subject so he considered he wasn’t an expert to really talk about it... With this you get an idea when he (or any scientist) talks about something, is because he freaking knows his facts, and he is gonna talk about everything through a psychologist perspective because that’s his field, wether you like his response or not.

But that’s what these people do: they change the rules, move the goalpost or anything they can to prevent others from reaching a higher moral pedestal than them, because without that moral pedestal, they have no power over people. For example, feminists always cry about rape, but don’t recognize that men also get raped, or if they do, they still blame men or their condition as men as the problem, not anything else. If a man suffers from domestic violence, that’s also regarded as “effect of the patriarchy” or a result of their masculinity (or just flat out mock the guys), because if it were recognized that men DO have problems, just like women, then they have no moral high ground to stand on.

I actually went to college and got degrees in physics and engineering. Those degrees sit framed on my wall and I make WAY more money than I would get as an engineer off of a certification I paid $300 and studied from a book fthat I downloaded off of the internet for a month and a half to get. All it REALLY takes to do what I do is to be able to clinb a ladder and remember orange/white, orange, green/white, blue, blue/white, green, brown/white, brown. As far as monopolies are concerned, you couldn't be farther from the truth and if you are looking towards the Democrats or the left to open up the market, you are barking up the wrong tree. Don't think for a second that your Democrat overlords are not catering to their corporatist sponsors by regulating industries to make the cost of entry and labor costs WAY too expensive for any small start-up to succeed and actually compete with the giants. As it is, all it takes is some geek in a garage to... The tech giants like FB, Apple, MicroShaft, and Alphabet know this so they are trying like mad to get the left into office to regulate. Personally, I left a large company in order to compete because I thought I could do a better job than they did. Guess what--I AM and I'm getting significant market share. I'm getting ready to start hiring and I'm going to hire somebody from behind the counter at McDonalds to train because that's hotter companies and education SHOULD work. The company invests in their employees' training and sends the employees to company sponsored education if it is needed. That doesn't happen anymore because anybody can get a federally backed student loan (thank you, federal Department of Education) and now employers can require it...so you go $150,000 into debt getting a COMPLETELY unmarketable degree in lesbian dance theory with a minor in underwater basket weaving because watching lesbians dance gets you off and then complain about not being able to get a job rubbing one out watching lesbians dance while weaving baskets under water that pays enough to raise a family of 12 (apparently, one of the lesbian dancers you work with wasn't really a lesbian) on a single income and still manage to pay off your student loan. Free degrees in under water basket weaving or lesbian dance theory don't help this situation. It may seem counterintuitive but REDUCING the availability of unnecessary scholastics and forcing companies to train people is actually the right step here. Our competency will go UP and since we have access to basically all of human knowledge instantly via the supercomputers we carry around in our pockets for tweeting youtube videos on facebook, sending emojis via text message, and calling our pets to tell them they are good dogs and cats during our lunch breaks, we can study what we like, when we please. That brings me to another problem with your comment. In the information age with free resources like Khan Academy, nobody has ANY excuse to be illiterate or uneducated either. All it takes is actually doing it...which many won't because they are too lazy to do it or too lazy to run a google search to find the information. If you want to know how to do ANYTHING from changing the brakes on your car to setting up an email server in your basement to avoid FOIA requests, skirt records retention policies, and illegally discuss classified material on an insecure non-government system, there's a YouTube video showing you how to do it along with tips on which security features to disable to make it REALLY easy.

He takes his individual responsibility mantra too far here, and it is actually borrowed from his sympathy with christianity-though he is does not prescribe to a religion himself. His mantra does not inspire me in the slightest, as he has nothing to say to me as a seriously sick housebound person. His meritocracy is a form of social darwinism which is damaging for many people to listen to as it puts so many people down. It fails to acknowledge the many social-economic factors that shape individuals, and the fact that genes account for most of our health including mental health. Becoming a socially influential person is reliant on having a healthy balance of neuro transmitters in the brain for example. if we lived in a libertarian socialist society, or an anarchical society,then every individual would be responsibie for climate change because individuals would equally have great power due to their being no centralisation of power, and probably no government to speak of. but as long as we have a government that controls everything then individuals have barely any power. social collective action therefore amplifies the individual's ability to sway politician's minds, but has to be done in such overhwhelming numbers, has to be interruptive protest, and for sustained periods of time, such as happened with suffragette movement, american civil rights movement e.c.t the fight to stop climate change lacks a bonna fide leader, and lacks structure, and lacks the sustained periods of protest=the recent extinction rebellion who gave up. if they had done that for a year and more members of public had joined them, until it was far too many people for police to arrest, then government would have been forced to act.",UCOMXp4oS8TiVcQ-O1XP3bvg,1,UgwXV6eRPPjIw77Mukl4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

None of what you believe is true but belief does not require evidence only stubborn faith and you have plenty of that. Prime Minister of England Margaret Thatcher was born to a dirt poor working class family in Northern England. Silvio Berlusconi one of the richest men in Italy and former Prime minister was from shopkeepers in tiny village. Lech Walesa was a dock worker in Poland who founded ""Solidarity"", toppled the communist govt and became President. Charles De Gaulle, the most famous Frenchman since Charlemagne was born poor and worked his way up to become head of govt. The billionaire founder of Chinese telecom giant Huawei started with nothing. So did the founder of Ali Baba the biggest online shopping network in the world. Not like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who are all from comfortable upper middle class families. Only 3 American Presidents since the Civil War came from poor families. Lincoln, Truman and Obama. ""Only in America"" is fairy tale. But upward mobility is not proved by anecdotes its proved by facts and statistics about which you obviously know nothing. All you have is tired old cliches about ""the land of opportunity"" which ended for most Americans 50 years ago. Why dya think Trump complained that only people from ""shithole countries"" come here? Because in other rich countries they are better off staying put. As great a fool as you shouldn't advertise the fact on YouTube.

The fact is across the broad population Americans are less likely to improve their economic circumstances over the course of their lives than the citizens of any other 1st world country. I alluded in my prior post to the fact that was not formerly the case however it is true today. Among the contributing factors are degraded public education and the resulting rise in illiteracy. The US ranks nearly 40th in literacy compared to other developed nations, unaffordable college, a more monopolized economy than at any time since the gilded age, wage stagnation and the weakening of unions which protected working people from wage and pension cuts and gave them the financial security to invest in homes and make long term financial commitments.

If you improve yourself, the people choose to you will take notice and want to improve themselves. When you, your family, and friends improve, your community takes notice and wishes to improve, when your community improves, the nation takes notice and wants to follow as well. Finally, when your nation succeeds, the world will take notice and follow suit. It is a wonderful idea, but I've met enough people with jealousy and hatred in their hearts to know that it doesn't work that easily, unfortunately. Some people, like the young lady who asked the question, when given a chance to improve upon themselves will instead blame things outside their power. At the end of the day, why focus on those things outside your power? Whining and throwing fits won't change the course of a tornado, strengthening your home will. Just the same, stressing about climste change won't fix anything if you don't have the power to change it. In order to gain the power to change it you have to focus on yourself and building up your knowledge and wealth. I've said this multiple times, but in different ways, but I really want to drive this point home: *focusing on things outside of your control will only bring unnecessary stress, anxiety, and depression.

""Our medical establishment does presently give the OK for such drug use as long as one gets their stamp of approval, and on top of that, our society goes along with it for the most part as an acceptable remedy for self-issues. In the event where drugs are used inappropriately or in excess, then it's treated like its a ""disease"" that's curable with a little therapy. "" Basically everything you wrote here is wrong. Not only would no medical institution give an approval to take Benzodiazepines for YEARS, its also completely delusional to think you could fix it with ""a little therapy"". Its literally harder to get away from Benzodiazepines than from Heroine. Either this is a case of dangerous sciolism or you are intentionally downplaying one of the worst addictions there are to make Peterson look better. Don't sugarcoat a problem. This would have been Petersons advice as well. ""it's not gonna harm his reputation in the eyes of his peers or fanbase"" Which tells enough about his fanbase if being a hypocrite doesn't hurt it. ""Aren't astral physics incredible? "" Yes they are. You should look into that. Its literally one of my biggest fields of expertise so please don't try to make an entrance to the topic with bogus christian semantics. @Ralph McBride ""Show me the specific sequence pf statements, together with the entirety of their cpntextual embodiment in Peterson's work, then show me how he specifically violates it"" The sweet bliss of ignorance. Its literally Rule 6 in Petersons book: ""Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world"". I am sure you will understand that I am not going to copy paste the entire chapter for you, but I guess you are perfectly able to realize on your own that no amount of context of his book will turn this very carefully crafted Rule on its head.

I'm not at all saying ""don't strive for greatness or social change"" or ""just lie down and die"". If that's what you got from my comment, well that would be a cynical interpretation. Great people are great because they dealt with issues within their power, they don't just wake up great or simply complain. Like I said lead by example, and people will want to join your cause and recognize your greatness or possibly not. For example a great father isn't great just because he is a father or because he believes it. The father's greatness comes from every action taken, not just simply being there and having fun. The whole point was take to initiative over your life and your surrounding, aspire to be great and inspire others to follow in your lead. Do that and things can change, and that is exactly what every notable historic person has done. Now as JP has said before ""all progress is change but not all change is progress"". Basically, an idea can easily start as morally ""good"" or grey, however through all of the actions of the people who are required to obtain/enforce that idea is where the morality of the goal can easily become corrupted. Great people in history are generally those who made a positive impact. But it's hard to say who will be great today, and who will be viewed as evil by history. At one point Hitler was viewed as a great man (man of the year), now he is viewed as one of the worst people in history. I guess the real question is how far are you willing to go to obtain your goal? Especially if it came down to civil unrest and disobedience. People are already protesting against the coronavirus lockdown, and look I am totally fine with the stay-at-home order, as a suggestion. But the over enforcement and a refusal to look at any options to end the order is where I draw the line. Some places are releasing convicted felons from prison due to covid-19, yet locking people up for disobeying lockdown orders. When civil liberties are dismissed and refused for long enough, civil disobedience and possible civil war follow. Now will the soldiers just follow orders? I don't know, I wouldn't...

To go back to your first point, some people believe the coronavirus is being used as an excuse to force the world to stop burning fossil fuels.

That tactic generally doesn't work on most people especially people like Jordan Peterson. This question simply sounded vindictive, and was not asked in good faith. If someone wants a real answer, they usually don't end their question with an insult. Besides the question wasn't really dodged, after all who should care what Peterson has to say about climate change? Is he a climatologist? No, that is not his expertise. He is a clinical psychologist, so the closest thing to a question that would have actually pertained to his field of expertise would have been: What advice would Jordan Peterson give to people when they see a great problem (such as climate change) but feel as though they can't do anything about it. However this is basically his life philosophy: Life is hard and full of chaos, and ultimately we can only control our own actions. And either those actions create more chaos or more order in our own life. So the only logical thing to do is make sure your room is clean, then your house, your yard, your neighborhood, and you keep moving forward and lead by example. People want to be lead by example not by force. So you want people to live green? Live green yourself and try and change other people's mind to live green as well. Forcing people against their will, will only result in blood shed as proven by history. But basically breath, you are not Atlas. Putting the whole weight of the world's problems on your shoulders is not advisable in the least bit. You are the master of your own actions, not other people's actions.

A regular small dose of benzodiazepines over the course of three to four days causes physical addiction/dependance. Even though you aren't abusing it.

The doctor will correct you and say no, you aren't addicted (physically) you are dependant. Which is completely different. Physical addiction to a drug and dependency are even different terms. I used cannabis for 15 years and downregulated my endocannabinoid system so much that I'm ""addicted"" to it per se, but I'm not ""addicted"" because cannabis isn't addictive. So what's wrong with me? I have a substance abuse disorder that led me to abuse marijuana and that in turn made me physically dependant due to a lot of negative feedback loops. Now if I try to quit I can't sleep and get diarrhea and also get panic attacks. The drug isn't addictive like opiates where your first dose causes physical addiction in the brain. In using it for so long, however, my body got used to all the excess dopamine and endocannabinoids pouring in that it didn't have to make as many and downregulated it's production of those chemicals. Now when I quit I don't have enough dopamine and endocannabinoids naturally to not go through ""withdrawal"" until my brain upregulates these chemicals because I am dependant. I no longer have substance abuse disorder but I am physically dependant on cannabis. It's a tangly web but I hope I weaved it well.

You can turn on Intervention and it's clear as day. When in turn, the physical addiction may make it impossible for them to get off the drugs even after therapy has been done and they are psychologically healed. Due to the addictive nature of things like opiates and the downregulation of the brain in response to these drugs, they cause physical dependence. This physical dependance is not ""substance abuse disorder"". The substance abuse disorder was the trifecta of what was driving them to use in the beginning and the habituation of seeking that drug to relieve their mental anguish plus the physical addictive nature of the drug now making it impossible for them to get off without detox.

Substance use disorder is a long standing behavioral expression over time in which the user seeks drugs and is a drug addict due to underlying trauma or mental illness. Someone who has never been a drug addict or had substance use disorder can become physically dependant on a medication without being psychologically expressant of substance abuse disorder and would not be termed to be a drug addict.

The purpose of language is to communicate. If people in a country generally agree on how to use the language, then they are communicating effectively, even if their dialect differs from that of another country that uses the language slightly differently. You don’t go to Jamaica and tell them they’re not speaking English properly. You just accept the fact that a country with a different cultural history is naturally going to develop a different way to use the language. Complaining about the use of an ‘s’ vs a ‘z’ is like complaining about someone’s pronunciation being wrong just because they have a Canadian Accent instead of a British one. And on the topic of saying “USA” vs saying “America”, it’s okay for people to have multiple ways of referring to a country (like saying “England” or “Britain”). It’s generally pretty clear from context whether a person is referring to the country or the continent. To my knowledge, people don’t even really refer to the continent as just “America”. Usually they specify “North America”. Even if they’re talking about both North and South America, people often say “The Americas” instead of just “America”. So there’s no real communication error that arises from referring to the USA as America. No offense, but it seems like you’re just complaining for the sake of being condescending. There’s plenty of reasons to criticize America, but the way we spell “realize/realise” is uselessly petty.",UCBVEYMjXCpQpZfn7zOY_o0w,1,UgzgweGVOXqrbvKr0JR4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Look into ourselves as individuals, how can I improve to get further and immediately what are things I can be doing even right now. Start with the immediate things, do them, keep improving and expanding ability / capacity to influence and then in due time, change the world. Changes start with real action, setting real objectives and knock them down one by one. If money is an issue, first, focus on making money for a few years. If my intellect is an issue, focus on studying for a few years. If I can't pass a degree or can't make enough money to pay bills, I probably can't run the country, it's that simple.

For instance take the president's wall. It is extremely relatively simple to erect a wall...we do it all the time. And no doubt that it would hinder illegal immigration. But the reason that we don't simply do it is because the collective disagrees that this is the best action to take. Personally I think that there are more financially feasible and more effective solutions. So in this scenario we know the problem, we know generally how to solve the problem but the problem persists.

I don’t think it’s banal, like the roughly 95% of people who watched this video. You and the woman seem to be in the minority here. Also, who are you arguing with? No one is saying that self improvement alone will magically solve all global issues, or that one person alone can fix economic crisis, if that’s even possible. If you think that’s what JP is saying, that’s a gross misinterpretation of his ideas. JP’s position is that people should take responsibility for their own lives in the face of hardships, whether bestowed upon them by themselves or society. The woman in the video harshly criticizes him by saying that his theory of individual responsibility falls flat on the ground when it comes to big global issues. However, when individuals collectively get their lives in order, it does BENEFIT society as a whole, which JP is arguing from his years of experience dealing with people. Look, if you are so concerned about homelessness and struggling to get by yourself, you need to reorder your priorities. Perhaps, if you get a well paid job you will be able to donate a small portion of your income to charitable organizations that provide shelter to those in need. Maybe you blog about it, share your story and inspire hundred others to do the same. You post flyers and organize meetup events, and maybe give a ted talk to reach to a much wider audience. Because of your efforts, thousand less people are homeless. Have you completely eradicated homelessness? No, but you have made a noticeable impact and benefited society as a whole. None of this would be possible if you were miserable financially or mentally. Do all individuals have a collective responsibility to provide shelter to the homeless? Maybe, but I doubt they will be able to contribute much without taking personal responsibility to get their own needs met and accumulate resources. The point is, once you have fulfilled your needs, you will be able to approach these social causes from a place of power and abundance, instead of neediness and resentment. JP is not wrong in saying that people often push for social causes out of their own unfulfilled needs and bitterness.

Have you done research on this? You don’t think there’s a mental health crisis? To you his responses might seem “banal.” But psychologists, therapists, and even neuroscientists argue that little habits like waking up early and exercising can have a SIGNIFICANT impact on one’s mental health. And this is proven from a purely neurological perspective and research. The fact is, while these people and social activists are criticizing JP for merely suggesting that individuals need to take personal responsibility, JP is actually impacting lives of people globally as a clinical psychologist and a lecturer. He mentioned in one of his videos how he helped his female patients advance in their career, get raise and promotions by teaching them practices on vulnerability and assertiveness. By simply that, he has made a larger impact on the “wage gap” issue than any of the gender studies activists who spend all their time rallying and protesting. As a prominent psychologist, he is helping thousands of people improve their mental health, thus contributing significantly to solving mental health crisis, which is a global issue.",UCf621eJ5mPJVvth7Sbbk8lA,1,UgyVpf9vHVnlApgD0054AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

He responds by saying, work hard to get a position of power and influence where you can make change. By attempting to provide an individualist explanation to solve this problem he is saying that individualism IS the solution to this problem. And individualism CANNOT be the answer to this problem because no matter how powerful an individual is, they alone cannot reverse the effects of global warming. Personally, I don't see how you could think otherwise. Big issues will remain, regardless of how much the individual perfects himself because such issues take a collaborative effort of many to resolve. It's as simple as that...the problem is that JP is either incredibly ignorant about this or he is so stubborn that he is incapable of admitting his faulty reasoning here despite it being so simple to see.

Saying that “by working on yourself you can make a positive impact on the community” is not the same as saying “if you work on yourself, all the global issues will dissolve on their own.” Obviously, there has to be some change on the collective level. But he wasn’t being asked what things specifically will resolve climate change or economic crisis. He was being questioned on how his theory on personal growth can have an impact on global issues. His response was specific to that. And yes, plenty of individuals are making substantial contributions to the planet and helping social causes by themselves. As an example, look at all the powerful CEOs of top tech companies making philanthropic contributions and impacting lives of millions of people worldwide. Do you think they were bettering themselves, improving their skills, and engaging with tech and development out of some moral responsibility for the collective good or their own personal interest and passions? You should make sure you can feed yourself, have a house of your own, and feel secure in yourself before worrying about homelessness or world hunger, no? That’s precisely what JP is suggesting. It’s common sense. To think that without having any resources (E.g.: money) or without meeting your needs for security and esteem you can change the world is just dumb.

You're welcome for the compliment, I'm sure you get lots of them 😉 I suppose it is a very attractive ""J"" so thank you lol 😂, not as nice looking as you though 🥰. If you saw a picture of me and found me attractive I would be on top of the world 🗻. I would be lucky especially since you are so 🔥 I apologize for anything I've said to you that was rude too and as you said misunderstandings do occur in written communication as you cannot always tell how a person meant something that was said. I'm sure it wouldn't have happened if we spoke verbally. I know everything isn't based on looks but I think you're exes made the right decision in being on good terms with you because if I was them I would cherish the interaction with you, I'm sure you have some fond memories. To match your beautiful angelic face, I'm sure you are a very nice person in real life so kudos to your parents for coming together ❤️ and producing someone truly splendid and marvelous both on the outside and on the inside. I can only imagine that your voice sounds delightful too! I meant what I said, if I get married one day then she better be like you and anyone seeing you for the first time will be pleasantly surprised. When I wake up to a bright sunny day with the sunshine on my face it's almost perfect, imagine looking across the bed to see your face though that would be perfect. When you do get into a relationship again, that person must pinch themselves and really appreciate existence, I know that I would. I'm not saying that you have to do what I tell you to do but I hope you smiled this morning when you woke up and looked in the mirror, that surely must make you happy. You looking at your own reflection everyday must be the opposite of depression and must be very joyful for you. In a way I'm actually happy that we got into this argument thing as I have enjoyed debating with you and the outcome. It really is a nice picture profile 😊 and you look so happy.

Nope, not in a relationship, but I'm on good terms with all my exes so I'm definitely not the bickering type. I hate drama. Well I guess I'll take this opportunity to apologize for calling you a Karen or anything that was rude. You just seemed to be getting a bit wound up so it struck me as funny based on the subject of the original comment. I'm actually a very nice person in real life. You probably are too. So we can chalk it up to misunderstanding. They often occur when dealing only in written communication. It's nice when something can be turned around into a positive interaction, so kudos on taking the high road and doing so.

Jordan was very easily able to expose how unaccountable she was with one simple question (""Do you have it easier than your grandparents?"") and she never answered that question and the host had to run to her defense to make sure she didn't have to answer it. But the point is valid. She was shamed and she laughed because (under no circumstances) is she going to change her behavior or learn from Jordan Peterson.

While I do agree that individual decision making plays an important role in where a person stands in society, there are significantly larger forces at play that cause one person to end up somewhere in society and what have you (especially in America). Race, socioeconomic status, and even something as simple as where you were born also affect your place in society, just to name a few. For Jordan Peterson to say it's all about individual decision making and to put it so plainly as to 'not make bad life choices', whether intentionally or not he's ignoring not only the sheer amount but also the severity of the other conditions that lead people to be where they are in society. It's also unfortunate that Peterson isn't the only one who believes this. Another person at the forefront of this idea is Ben Shapiro, as he often talks about how the only way to end crime in high-crime areas is for an individual to ""decide they're not going to pick up a gun and shoot someone"". While I agree that the individual is responsible for their actions, it's incredibly disingenuous and quite frankly ignorant to disregard the other factors that have an immaculate impact on those very decisions people make.",UC5hhyQVAKsTv3Qfnj2O1qLQ,1,UgwP53fLIBWRDl3Vyh94AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

If we don't teach people to be good, then we just will have a different environment where different evil people will do evil things to other different evil people.",UCUbKWqQ87Z2mWl_iAUgDAwg,1,Ugyzov17E7o6OZQDet54AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

It's crazy how much of a pattern can be formed throughout recent history that can be correlated to the next generation's rise into the next. For anyone to argue that their grandparent had it easier or worse is truly unproductive, as NOBODY has lived through, or lived in the time of their grandparents, there is only the here and now. However, times have changed, and a new era of challenges faces the current generations. Petterson Himself has stated such, hence why he's seen such an uprising in popularity. schools, jobs, even our government has turned into a sick game of being the most oppressed or lowest minority around. An epidemic, whether it's a sickness of health or of economy, is effecting the newest generations more, as they have less stable positions in their jobs and general economic standing.We have veterans coming home from the middle east that are shell shocked by war just as much as the war with Vietnam, and with the availability of death in drone strikes even ""pilots"" who sit at desks remotely controlling these machines are horrified by the death we cause. An Orwellian social media network is being forged before our eyes. At this very moment they are spying on you with every data point from your locations, to the audio your phone's camera just so happens to pickup at every moment it's turned on. Anyone who does not conform to the ideals of the technocracy is silenced and shoved into a corner. We are on the cusp of something big what it is I have yet to see, but easy is hardly the word I think we will us to describe it as. Argue what you will, but to say that the current generations have it so much better than the previous is asinine, and it goes back to the whole being the most oppressed or lowest minority around. It's stupid, unproductive, and inconceivable as you're taking a huge collection of people, each with challenges and privileges, that the next generations will not receive and vice versa, boiling them down to nothing more than Identity politics.",UCo8zo7z5BNk43dmKDWEreIQ,1,Ugw2oLmRwPofzeeBWqN4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

The question presupposes that this generation faces incredible hardship and oppression, which is simply ridiculous and a sign of the pathetic education received. Second, that what enabled past generations to face hardship incomparably worse than today's was precisely a training in personal responsibility. Third: that young women and men such as this girl take for granted and don't appreciate the ""miracle"" of the society in which they live - an astonishing product of human learning, genius, sacrifice and mutual collaboration, based on shared knowledge and values and - incredibly - able to afford vast (but of course, not total) freedom.

He answered the question perfectly by pointing out that crying out ""collective responsibility"" does not end your responsibility as an individual. That it is a common practice among people nowadays to act as if they are worried about climate change to look good, while not doing anything to make amends to their own lifestyle. He also explained how a person can do more for the environment by focusing on things he/she/they can do individually and gradually improve in their lives and thereby being a good example to follow instead of constantly whining about collective responsibility. Apart from a psychologist, he is also a smart man, who is able to make sensible arguments from a point of view that resonates with majority of the population and not necessarily with professional psychologists, instead of being judgmental like yourself and calling people weak and unprofessional because someone did not give you the answer that you expected from them. You might also like to refrain from referring to people using terms like Fanboys/girls considering they might just be ""normal people"" agreeing to his point of view, because that is the ""weakest"" and the ""most unprofessional"" argument a person can make.",UC3FYEW_xk7lmp0ur7kD-0Iw,1,Ugy_jmFFt5_Scy5ItlB4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

While I do understand the girl's points, it is vital for people to first understand that they have to work on themselves before thinking about solving problems on a grander scale. The problem with global problems like climate change is that there's no clear answer as to how it can be fixed. It's easy to say collective effort or cooperation but we have to understand that not everyone experience the same upbringing. I think Jordan's answer is the most realistic response possible. While you can influence other people to do better, the only thing you can be sure of is yourself. Going back, collective effort will naturally come into fruition once people are able to achieve that sense of self responsibility and the like.

Why is it that she cannot show or speak of concerns about issues facing all of us which are very urgent indeed UNTIL she is a size you feel comfortable with? As we see extreme weather devastating places over the world more and more and more year by year, why is it that you seem to think that what she should do is go on a diet RATHER than (as opposed to as well as) address the situation we are all in? And since you and so many others here want people to clean their rooms so much, why are these comments about self accountability and room cleaning so full of humiliating, deriding, dehumanising comments about her and her weight? And why are so few people calling for these people who are labelling her a 'land whale' or 'side of bacon' or countless other names not being called out by other people calling for people to 'clean their rooms'? Or do clean rooms include infantile, thoughtless bully bullying?

He was always very adamant about not having perfected these ideals and principles, but aimed at them because the more we practice the more narrowly we miss the bullseye, but another arrow can always knock us off our horse at any moment. Peterson was very appropriately nuanced in his statements. Also, he was VERY clear about not advocating the carnivore diet for anyone else, merely explaining that he gave it a try because it was helping his daughter with her many conditions, and then it helped him with his. There were marked, demonstrable improvements, and this seems to be a common trend in the carnivore community. I'm not on board with the diet yet, either, but the malnourished/scurvy critique of it seems to fail miserably in the real world. Anyway, I see your point in your responses here and am not looking for an argument, just hope you can add se nuance to your understanding of Peterson.

The ordered house/clean room analogy is a sweeping, over-simplified excuse to avoid giving any advice that would challenge the status quo, and a highly predictable one coming from a PragerU shill who has a vested interest in the status quo remaining largely unchallenged.

Respn for that is (at least in europe) the rise of neo-liberalism in the 70ies (Look up what role democracy has in a neo-liberal society versus a keynsian society).

Though, I believe that doesn't seem to be the case: In order to tackle these problems, you wouldn't need to understand them completely, you would only require someone to break it down to you, same way Peterson does. Understanding his words isn't that hard, so you wouldn't be that much of a time consumer for you to not feel free in order to understand his arguments.

Patrick Kent's summary of JP's point is a perfect example of a simplified idea derived from another individual making (consensus) accurate claims. On the other hand, your vague and disoriented descriptions of human psychology and evolution to support your broader point is ironically a perfect example of your unfortunate vomit scenario; ideas and speech that simply shouldn't be repeated because they are so obviously flawed in their deliverance.

He himself calls it a collectivist mentality in another section of this show. Hiding from your problems has never been considered therapeutic by any psychologist worth their salt, and that is part of what identity politics is. The other part of identity politics is granting the primacy of the group over the individual, and that is a collectivist perspective. It is also extremely classist, racist, and sexist, because those are the main groups being used for identity. The unwillingness to separate ,or even recognize, the individual in a group identity is part of the issue and has caused more trouble in the last 200+ years than it has solved. But again, JP is a psychologist. I wouldn't go to him with a problem about my spleen, car, or rain clouds, but I might about my depression or even how to improve my relationship with my wife since those are within his purview. Asking him what you can do about the environment and getting surprised to get a psychologist answer like, ""clean your room,"" shows an expectation outside the bounds he has set for himself and made very clear.",UCbYQJvpK5YK12TfvNj4FAzA,1,UgwIPEYduNgJbxzEGOZ4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

I never said anything about electric cars vs fossil fuel cars, yet you started with a ""but"". JP's presentation was as much about what are you going to do about it rather than just talking about it to look cool. If all you're going to do is complain, then you aren't really accomplishing much. Getting up and actually doing something is more productive. He's not allowing the veil of ""group"" to disguise you from your own personal responsibilities, and that is driving these collectivists nuts. If you ask any professional a question, their answer will be couched within their professional experience. JP was asked a climate question, even though he's a psychologist.

First I've done the math for a class in the past, an EV in West Virginia doesn't even make up the eco-debt when comparing CO2 output to average ICE mileage. Even in California (with the largest eco-friendly energy sources in America), it takes about 50,000 miles to make up the eco-debt just from the CO2 output in creating the fuel cell. And, that is leaving out the electricity lost in resistors/wheel-to-well and possible replacement and disposal of fuel cells. ""Oh, well the further we shift to clean energies and introduce subsidies/taxation the sources of energy will become more clean."" Wrong. Middle eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, which are totalitarian governments, have about 90% of their exports based on oil / petro products. If America (20% of the world's oil consumption) shifted and cut their market-share through high subsidies, they would just mass produce and lower the costs of oil further to combat the economical toll.

The problem with groups is that there is NO responsibility, accountability and consequences . That's precisely why people like that arrogant women and the chair of the panel enjoy groups and the ""collective"" ... they are essentially cowards, because they hide in groups to avoid accountability and consequences. This allows them to abuse in public and then run back to the group where they can diffuse liability amongst the group. This is why the law needs to yank them out the group and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. ""Collectivism"" is just another word for COMMUNISM. It is where you give up your individual rights for the group. It has the same dynamics as a Totalitarian One Party State. It produces nothing, because groups don't compete, only individuals do and the individuals within the group are not allowed to compete because you gave up those rights to be subordinate to the group. So NO innovation takes place, individuals are dumbed down to the lowest common denominator within the group, and ""group think"" takes over where Zombies resort to shouting slogans bereft of critical thinking ability or logic. Also violence becomes the culture of the group because they need to FORCE control on the individuals in the group to maintain compliance to ""group think"". The smart and innovative people leave the group, because they have more to offer and don't like being dictated to ... and only the idiots remain ... the woman who arrogantly, condescendingly and disrespectfully asked JP a question is one of them and so is the woman in the red outfit next to Jordan Peterson. They are quintessential examples of the product that ""collectivism"" / Communism creates. It's only a matter of time before the idiots also leave the group, because their turn eventually comes when they are forced to be subservient to the group on an issue important to them as an individual and they don't like it ... so they leave as well, but in the meantime enormous damage and destruction is done usually with many people getting killed and families ripped apart. That sir is ""collective"" and Communism at work and that is the ABC and main stream media ... infested with group think.

You changed it to ""values"" so you can put your own perverse spin on things ... totally dishonest, so you can see why people have no respect for the likes of people like you and her. The whole point of ""clean your room"" is that it is a metaphor for taking INDIVIDUAL ownership, responsibility and accountability for your own actions and choices before virtue signalling to the world about that which you are not. ""DON'T LITTER"" is something you can take RESPONSIBILITY for today ... you don't need ""collectivism"" to make a decision to NOT LITTER ... it is an INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. If everyone made that same INDIVIDUAL CHOICE then we wouldn't have floating garbage dumps the size of cities floating in the ocean. If you VALUE something, like the environment, then by being a RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUAL you can do your bit to change the world rather than attending talk fests, protests and virtue signalling, but by actually doing something and being a positive agent of change. In other words don't lecture the world on garbage and climate change and insult people at public forums, pick up a piece of paper in your street ... clean your room. Heck, my parents taught me that as a child because they understood the underlying PRINCIPLE of individual ownership and responsibility. And guess what ...

I am just pointing out that JP's theses that you will have more impact on the world if you adopt good personal habits is wrong. Having your life together can lead to more personal success socially, economically and career wise but has no bearing whatever on the impact one can have on larger issues like global warming, war and peace and income inequality for example. There is no evidence of any connection between personal togetherness and impact on global issues. On the contrary many of the people who actually make history and move society forward are misfits, outcasts, radicals, philanderers, mysogynists, alcholics, drug addicts who did NOT have their personal lives together but went on to greatly influence the lives of millions of people. Would Einstein have come up with a better equation than e=mc squared if he combed his hair? Would Lincoln have been a better President if he paid more attention to his marriage? The idea is absurd. If JP confined his advice to people simply trying to get a better job or buy a home I would have no argument with him but his advice to the woman was to get her act together first, become Prime Minister and then concern herself with the environment. JP is inventing a fiction. Good personal habits do not lead to more effective advocacy on global issues.

The view that many young people try to mask their inadequacies by affiliating themselves with a larger cause. That their moral outrage over issues like war or corruption or corporate crime or environmental destruction is not authentic but merely an excuse to evade responsibility in their own lives. He has said and apparently believes all of that. For someone who has read Freud, Jung, William James, Bruno Bettelheim, BF Skinner, Ehrenfels (Gestalt) , Carl Rogers, Piaget, Maslow, Posner and Peterson I'm not impressed by JPs slick repackaging of memes that have been around since Solomon and Hammurabi. His fame is in no way justified by his intellectual or scholarly work. His fame derives from his pugnacious and testy persona.

That instead of genuine moral outrage it is psuedo moralistic posturing and a narcissistic deflection away from their personal failings and a desire to shame and manipulate those who don't share their views.

Does she have to stop eating french fries before she can have an authentic opinion on climate change? Is her concern about climate change just a deflection from her underlying french fry problem? What a convenient way to shut people up. What if I shut you up by pointing out that ""allusions of grandeur"" is a nonsense phrase. There is no such expression. Delusions of grandeur is what you meant to say. So you have vocabulary challenges. Should I therefore dismiss your opinion on income inequality and climate change?

You are talking about people who don't have a clean room, not about people you can't keep a clean room, there is a nuanced difference. Someone that would be unable to clean and maintain a room probably shouldn't be trusted with very much (outside transactions/research), though that doesn't mean everyone with messy rooms are unable to be clean due to circumstances/compromises you have talked about. Part of the issue with skipping fundamental steps as keeping your life in check and jumping straight into activism is arrogance. If you have no track record of fixing and managing problems of increasing complexity how on earth can you be you confident in your ability to work on far more complex and multi domain issues. I can understand if activists goal is just to raise awareness, so people better suited to make the changes can do so but that's it. One of the best examples of this working in real life is a young man who went scuba diving and realised that a lot of the trash in the sea floats close to the surface, with this realisation he started up a organisation to effectively clean huge parts of the ocean. This one man has done more than 1000's of activists combined because he effectively applied himself to a domain that he could do something directly about, he's the hero that we can all strive to be more like.

It doesn’t follow that having one area in your life in order means or is necessary for having another area of you life in order. People make sacrifices in order to achieve their goals. Aiming to have your life in balance is a healthy goal, but sometimes life requires compromises. 3) there can be structural barriers that prevent you from having your life in order that may be worth sacrificing for in order to change. The most logical thing to do in order to get your life in order might be to become an activist in order to affect change and improve your situation. Or you might altruistically become an activist to help improve the situation of other people’s lives. 4) the stereotype that activists do not have their lives in order is silly. Some might not. But others who are responsible for organizing are probably very out together especially if their natural aptitude is to organize.

Yes, she was rude really. Her opening line didn’t help to get her the answer she wanted. Having said that, she didn’t insult him personally, just his Baha’i advice. Do you think that that might be interesting, when Peterson can’t laugh criticism off? Is he a snowflake? I also think that some people do want scapegoats, I agree with you. People should have boundaries :-) Bear in mind that whilst we can work to control our environment, we never have complete control. And that sadly higher powers do *really* play the ace cards.

And it showed me that we talk about completely different things, as well as Peterson and the girl. My point is not that individual is responsible for climate change - he's just responsible for himself and quality of his life (mostly). And that is what Peterson is saying in his book and in the video. He is a clinical psychologist, not a sociologist or politician, and he never claimed himself as such. He's helping to solve problems of individual, not problems of humanity. And the problem with the girl is that by asking him a question that lays beyond his expertise, she's doing it with hostility and disrespect. Her tone and reaction shift attention from the question she asked to herself and her obvious flaws. So I actually wasn't criticizing the question itself - I was criticizing her.

A historical awareness of human struggles does not mean that we should advocate complacency. Profound democratisation of society has come from really, really stubborn and annoying people. Nazi enablers were always the “ nice, I won’t rock the boat” type of people. Women were allowed to vote as a result of the Suffrage movement. Climate change is a big growing threat. It really has to be taken seriously, but the corporations aren’t. The scientific consensus says this. 2. She may or may not have a highly externalised locus of control. But I don’t see how her suggestion that most people cannot effect much if any change at systematic level rather than personal level is actually a highly externalised locus of control? Our governments, funded and owned by the trans-national capitalist class are not making reasonable adjustments to protect the environment and the rest of society as a result . So that’s not a highly externalised locus of control in this specific case - it’s the truth! She has zero power to stop deforestation as an individual. That’s her whole point. It’s fine for Peterson to advocate personal responsibility for things within our power - but not to dismiss when we can’t as a victim complex. If Peterson addressed how Current Neoliberal Individualism offered the idea that individuals alone can affect environmental change - then I’d have more respect for his advice. However, making people feel solely responsible for climate change and carbon footprints is, of course, a con. Factories are pumping out incredible amounts of toxic waste and no amount of individuals buying low energy light bulbs or organic lavender disinfectant will change this. Peterson is categorically wrong to overlook this. 3. What economics doesn’t she understand?",UCvAPtyMHLnURFIPFtIBpN4w,1,UgybUGEAJRNkdOvEgc54AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

This girl definitely has some problems with her locus of control - she has the external one, which means she's blaming the world and trying to change it instead of dealing with her personal problems first (her attitude and complaints clearly demonstrate some of them) 3.

The reason I do is because as an independent voter for 26 years, and someone who knows democrats and republicans, I can honestly say from my own experiences that the left side is far more unwilling to listen to others perspective (hence cancel culture) or accept the fact that they may not always be right.

His answer is the answer of a good clinical psychologist. You don't have control over anything but yourself. Once you control yourself, you can influence those around you, and continue to work upwards. Being distressed over global warming really doesn't accomplish anything, and frankly, global warming disaster just doesn't seem all that incipient. Cutting down your personal use of fossil fuels, encouraging your circle to be more environmentally conscious, and supporting green politics are things that you can do. As your personal power increases through internal development, your ability to influence the world also increases.

Iv heard Peterson respond to similar questions much more articulately and definitively than he did here which I attribute to His sense of the young lady’s clearly adversarial demeanor, but the answer goes more or less like this: becoming cognitively strong/healthy In yourself will allow you to positively affect your sphere of influence, and those in your sphere of influence will then improve as a result of mere contact (via the morphogenetic collective field -sheldrake) and thus better the habits of themselves and so to THEIR spheres of influence. This pattern continues expanding outward in exponentially larger influential waves and within 4-5 degrees of separation the world has improved and the problems, becoming self-evident, have solved themselves. Obviously thats a significantly simplified version of what an entire book could be written to explain but that’s essentially the ideology. Change on a large scale Must start close at hand.

Because fundamentally who are these protesters? Young people, moderately educated but with little to no experience of the world and consequently no real power or a legitimate source of intellectual capacity from which real change can be derived. Who are the ones in power generally? Who can make real change instead of talking about it? People who took personal responsibility for their own life, climbed the hierarchy in their respective domaines and then understand the issues enough to have a valid opinion and also have the capacity to do something about it. You don’t get to skip the hard part of learning and demonstrating your competence before you irrevocably change the fabric of the world itself. Climate change and economics are no less complicated an issue than the design of motor vehicles and the design of motor vehicles have no less of an impact on the quality of life of modern societies, yet no one would suggest that a 19 year old gender studies student should march on the street and suggest changes to how cars are made.",UCcnU04n8uBUBDkKPJp8K8vw,1,UgxdJcnOvrHrJrXbHSd4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

What Peterson is talking about, that applies to her, is that there are definitely things to work on to make herself a better individual. The two most glaring ones just by her appearance here is her physical fitness, in her bitter attitude, and general ideological thinking. Her weight is not some superficial mean-spirited judgment, it's a biological and health science fact that she is in danger of bringing serious health conditions upon herself In this state. That means either now or eventually she will be less able to be useful and helpful to those around her in the world as a whole, not to mention being a burden upon the Healthcare System in exchange. The same goes for her bitterness. There is nothing useful or productive about being snide towards somebody you disagree with. If you are truly interested in solving the world's problems, the first step is to do your best to coexist with those who don't share your views, otherwise You are just fostering division which always leads to war and destruction in death of some sort eventually. what this woman and a lot of people like her fail to understand, or more likely do not want to understand, Is the importance of the role of personal responsibility. You need to take personal responsibility for all aspects of your own life including your health your mental health among other things. Instead they shirk their responsibilities and Retreat to the far leftist safe space of it being okay to be insufficient because you are you and you are special. that the epitome of the self-centered narcissism that these the epitome of the self-centered narcissism that these folks are trying to paint the True individualists like Peterson with. that attitude and position does no good, in fact it does mostly harm as we are all seeing.",UCcpDsRcNNORvperFhUy_1nQ,1,Ugyc8mWo-7cbt_6Uvnd4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

The point is she never really wanted to ask him a question and listen to what he had to say, she just wanted to tear him down, and that is very closed minded. People don't like her because she was basically trying to attack JP because she didn't like him, but pretended to hide this hate under her question.

If I want to make fun of someone's terrible life choices, that's my choice. I don't need internet strangers parenting me. Thats the problem with the world. Everybody is wrapped up in policing one another that nobody stops to fix their own issues. Im sure you aren't a saint. Nobody is perfect. So fix yourself before trying to fix the world. Thats the point of this. She wanted to be seen by millions, well she got it. At this point in time it is expected for people to criticize every detail about you if you are displayed in the media. If you dont like it, don't be on tv! She let the world see her ignorance and they came down hard on her. She is offended at JPs reasonable idea that personal responsibility is far more important than social ones. She does not want to be responsible for her own life so she wants to distract herself with issues ""beyond her control"" as she said. But she doesnt realise that if enough people were individually responsible there would be a great opportunity for change. It's fair game to ridicule her. Point of the story, if you can't force someone to be healthy or have sane opinions you also can't force someone to be nice, sympathetic, or even pleasant. That's just a fact of life. There will always be someone that doesn't like you for one reason or another. My advice is don't take it personally, because they don't know you and are judging you on one factor. So being offended is pointless. Limiting freedom of speech to spare someone's feelings is counterproductive.",UCr3ME1tgVK2LLROf0Hgay8w,1,UgyFRah4o1CPZaYuuVp4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Yes, as I’ve said time after time under this thread, he is quick to call people sensitive and give his opinion on such topics, but someone’s opinionated statement directed towards his opinionated statement is clearly the utmost offence in his eyes. Who is surprised that they’re not getting the answers they are hoping for? Cause I’m not hoping for anything... and if you’re referring to the lady in the video; she literally asked what he thinks are the answers to economic problems... it was an open ended question, free for him to answer as he wanted. Again, the majority of the audience were there to see who? The lady in the audience or Jordan Peterson on the panel? Obviously the audience was going to resonate with his arguments. Is she young? Cause clearly you’re the one boxing her in the “young people” category - when, again, she never referred to herself and falsely claimed victim hood on her behalf. Actually ‘older people’ are not a politically monolithic group. There is nuances in people’s views regardless of age. You’ve implied that once you get ‘older’ you have the ability to “look at things in perspective” - is that phrase a code for conforming to a belief system that mirrors that of Jordan Peterson? Cause I thought he is all about individuality, isn’t that funny. Again you mentioned a “lack of experience” as a reason for not being able to “look at things in perspective.” Tell me what experience Jordan Peterson has being a woman? Or being of colour? Or being a sexual minority? He doesn’t have any. So why does he speak on issues relevant to these groups - talking about “theres too much sensitivity nowadays.” You see when you make a career out of propagating opposition to PC culture and identity politics, while you’re not practicing what you’re preaching, then I can and will call out the hypocrisy whenever it comes up.

Peterson does support the right to say what you want. Just don't be surprised if you're not getting the answer(s) you're hoping for but get his opinion & perspective on things instead. Bottom line: if you want to verbally lock horns with Peterson, he'll more than gladly take you own. In this footage, Peterson (again) did just that and his response seemed to resonate with the majority (which is not a benchmark) of the attending crowd. Funny how it also seems to be a relatively younger member in the audience who doesn't like the answers/responses they're getting from people like Peterson. Why would that be, you wonder ?. My guess: lack of life experience and the ability to look at things in perspective. Something that usually tends to be absent/underdeveloped when you're young. Most of the time it's solved some 10-15 years further on, having learned (hopefully) on how to deal with life's obstacles and overcoming a couple of (inevitable) life events. I'll stop right here.

And Jordan Peterson’s views express support for such an offensive friendly environment. So he clearly needs to be careful about what he wishes for - he wants people to have the freedom to say what they want, as long as it’s not direct at his fragile self. Boy bye. The “he/she who is without sin...” verse, literally applies to Jordan Peterson. Well what she did highlight was legitimate issues that a lot of working class and even middle class people are facing - i.e. the climate crisis, economic crisis, the job market. To bring up a fair criticism of a current economic situation is not to say that you’re not trying to better your circumstances - criticism isn’t victim hood. Furthermore, she never said she was the one facing these issues, she said young people. So how is she claiming victim hood? Run the tape back. And she asked what’s his answer, not what’s the answer. There is no one size fits all answer, everyone’s ‘answers’ are different. She wanted his perspective, as heard by her reference to his “banal” comment - hence, why she said “what’s your answers besides banal comments like clean your room.” I will say I agree with you - to an extent - that there are people who do avoid personal responsibility. But conversely, there’s people who use notions like “personal responsibility” and “individuality” as buzzwords to obstruct change that they do not want to see.",UCLfkZiaBRnzVLbji6rMKs4w,1,UgztQZRN04-llRNQf0B4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Not wise, it tends to set the ""tone"" of the exchange that follows (as it did). Peterson being a hypocrite is your opinion, I - for one - fail to see the compelling & irrefutable evidence for that. Maybe he has some views that ""maybe"" can be labeled as such but then again ""(s)he who is without sin...). The lady claimed she did not have (and maybe never would have) any control over (solving) current issues (hello victimhood) and could Peterson please deliver the solutions/answers to her ?. Peterson DID give a suggestion as to how to start with yourself and the suggestions he makes are valid & universal. Gandhi makes for a fine example how individual responsibility can change the course of history. Peterson's claim how certain people (quite easily seem to) surrender personal responsibility and hide in a collective ideology or set of beliefs (where ""everyone & no one"" has responsibility) is recognizable as well. A response not liked at all by the lady in question. As for the ""own medicine"" remark: present your case with a certain predisposition (as the lady clearly tried) and it's likely to get a clear response in return (as Peterson clearly did).",UC4k3zCD1IugAnNGtwKINqgA,1,UgztQZRN04-llRNQf0B4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

She essentially asked what his solutions were to current issues. If I were in her shoes would I have added the “banal”, perhaps not. It’s about Jordan Peterson being a hypocrite, period. Whether you choose to see it or not it’s there. Cause at the end of the day if respect is reciprocated then he must keep that same energy when it comes to all his other views.

Sifting through all the comments, I'd say the majority seem to view the ""question -> response"" exchange the same way I do. She started off with making a statement/remark instead of asking a question, hinting towards Peterson's that his answer had better be original & not boring (because that's what banal means: ""lacking in originality and/or boring""). And ""words matter"", right ? Clearly, the woman's remark/statement was laced with a certain intent and constructed to illicit & provoke a response. And clearly it did, although probably not the way she was hoping for. The rest is crystal clear for all to hear. This isn't about PC speak, this isn't about Peterson being a person with a ""snowflake"" mentality and a matching response. This is about some basic communication fundamentals. To the lady: if you're not getting the reaction/response you're hoping for, rethink/rephrase your action (Peterson helped her along). Eighty percent of communication is non-verbal. Making a statement (or posing a question) with a certain derogatory demeanor and you may end up with an unwanted response.

I don’t understand your point in this statement and I don’t want to assume it’s meaning. I’m pretending censorship doesn’t exist for Jordan Peterson? “For the twelfth time now means nothing in terms of political correctness without censorship”, I literally don’t know what your point is lmao... cause I think you think I’m saying something that I’m not lol It’s not inane to draw a comparison, actually. My point “for the twelfth time” is everyone is offended subjectively.

It’s clear that you view this fundamentally differently, so you’re never going to understand the exact way I see this - cause it’s still evident that you’re not comprehending my point in full. Being asked to adjust your statement is censorship - she would be censoring aspects of her initial question. It’s not only censorship if he called for her to be removed.

You brought up the C-16 bill in your last response, not me - I’m simply pointing out his views on other issues. The C-16 bill hasn’t been the focus of this discussion either.

Censorship from an authoritative power based on arbitrary, subjective notions with the threat of legislative enforcement. It's quite clear you have absolutely no interest in trying, in the least bit, to take anything in. So let's make this clear once and for all. His reaction is not at all hypocritical of his dislike of PC culture, because his main concern with PC culture is censorship, in both legal and non-legal (de-platforming) means.

If you had a coherent rebuttal to my questions why not respond to them? When political correctness came about and when politeness came about is irrelevant to the fact that political correctness is rooted in politeness. But to answer your question, “political correctness” has been used differently throughout history by various ideological groups. In our current discourse it’s used refer to the avoidance of insulting others. I suppose politeness has always been around, I guess. Please enlighten me on when you believe political correctness came about and when politeness came about - and how the dates of their inceptions debunk their present connection. So if a 5 year old girl asks a man on the street the time - who I assume she doesn’t know - that could be interpreted as political. You haven’t specified why she’s on the street; so perhaps she’s homeless - if so, that’s child poverty, which is a political issue. Is she alone? If so, where are her parents? Did they leave her there? That’s neglect, there legal (political) ramifications for committing such an act. Was it cause they couldn’t afford to look after her financially - low wages, unemployment? Cause that’s political. How did she get there? Why might she be asking him the time? Cause the reasoning behind this scenario could well be a political one - almost everything we do in life is political. For example driving involves politics; i.e. road maintenance, driving and vehicle laws. Simply drinking water involves politics; access to a clean and safe water supply is political - as seen in Flint, Michigan in the US where their water has been contaminated for years - it’s not only a simple inconvenience of not being able to drink tape water, but also a public health crisis. “Why is it called political correctness” - I believe it’s called “political correctness” as oppose to the other terms you used because the term “political” encompasses a range of ideas; including, government affairs and policies, beliefs concerning governance, and it can also refer to power. And to again define “political correctness”, it is the avoidance of expressions or actions that are perceived to marginalise or insult - particularly, when referring to people from historically marginalised groups. It is political because political power, political beliefs held by society and the way political institutions use to govern was - and still is - in a way that these historically marginalised groups were disregarded for centuries. Political rights or privileges, such as voting were not afforded to all groups of society for most of history. When looking at history - as a whole - it’s been such a short period in which people of colour, women and members of the LGBT community have been given the rights that are enjoyed today - and there’s still further political action that needs to be made. So when people ask for you to avoid the use of terms or expressions that have degrading historical meanings; of which many people were lynched while being called such terms and still are to this day, in which many people were deprived of their rights in the name of such terms, in which a lot of these terms were used to dehumanise people for political gain, and in which decisions were wrongfully made for members of these groups by other groups through political policies and intervention - often times in violent ways - I believe it’s more than fitting to call it “political correctness.”",UCLfkZiaBRnzVLbji6rMKs4w,1,UgztQZRN04-llRNQf0B4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

I’m not “running circles around technicalities”, nor am I asking you to prove my claims. What I was asking was for you to tell me what’s wrong with what I’m referencing; however, you’re unable to answer that because I haven’t stated what I’m actually referencing yet. I’m simply pointing out your preconceived notions. This was evident when you said “he has given up his right to taking offence” - first off, that’s your opinion and that’s what you want to say, not me lol. Then you continued, “which is illogical, at least until we know what you’re drawing this narrative from”. So you admitted that you don’t actually know where I got this narrative from - yet you want to draw a conclusion from something you don’t know yet. It’s like me saying “I feel ill” and you responding, “unless you tell me what exactly is making you say this, it’s untrue.” Ok... well I could have been feeling nauseous, lethargic, I could have a fever or a headache, plus a whole range of other symptoms. This doesn’t mean I don’t feel ill, I just haven’t yet specified what symptoms I’m feeling. Instead you could have been like “what symptoms are you feeling?” In the context of our discussion, you could have just left it at your first question, “what are his views on sensitivity” and waited for a response. That would have been reasonable. But you formed an opinion prior to me giving you a response. So now I’ll tell you what exactly I was referencing - which isn’t in this video. Jordan Peterson has linked sensitive behaviour with parenting styles of overly caring for their children. He was referring to those parents who coddle their children/those that are overprotective. He says that those who get all that they want tend to be more sensitive and unable to deal with difficulties and that those who go through adversity tend to be more able to deal with struggles and less sensitive. However, he also says that those who disagree with his views on political correctness are “resentful” and “uninformed”. He says, those at ‘the bottom’ tend to feel resentment towards the hierarchical makeup of society and use political correctness to feel morally superior. Now Jordan Peterson expresses what I would call a libertarian right wing sort of ideology. So a lot of people who oppose his beliefs hold left-wing views - which makes them “resentful” and “uninformed” according to his own statements. If you look at the support of left-wing parties in much of the world; it comes from a lot of lower income voters - those at ‘the bottom’. So when Jordan Peterson talks about those at ‘the bottom’ who feel “resentful” and “uninformed” it would mean he is referring to lower income earners as they are the ones who reject his opinion as seen by their political leanings. This isn’t consistent with his belief that those who face adversity are more likely to be less “sensitive” as they would be “resentful” for holding a different opinion from him. Furthermore, it is more affluent voters who support political parties that uphold his views - which he believes would be more sensitive. Therefore, those two statements are again contradictions. Also, black people consistently vote at around 90% for the Democrats. Most black people also don’t like being called the “n-word” - which is a politically correct term. Therefore, by and large, this demographic disagrees with Jordan Peterson on multiple accounts. Are they therefore “resentful” or “too sensitive” for simply wanting people who are not black to refrain from using the “n-word”? It’s just clear to me that Jordan Peterson makes a lot of presumptive statements that don’t add up to his other beliefs. He also doesn’t take into account that people have differing experiences that contribute to their views it’s not about wanting to be “morally superior” or “resentful”. It’s about respect.",UCLfkZiaBRnzVLbji6rMKs4w,1,UgztQZRN04-llRNQf0B4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

The only point here is to assume something is not the best way to argue. Lime how you assumed JP was offended and like how the women assumed that cleaning the room is a banal answer for her question . The standards one sets for themselves indeed gives them a rating amongst others. However it is not and offense to assume in a open conversation. Only when you are lawfully asked to speak the truth in a court to ur knowledge the you should be worried about assumptions becuase it might end up being a defamation case. This is why i believe fundamentally freedom of speech in america is flawed. Singapore standard of speech freedom is definitely working well. In a society there musg be some limits to what you utter and the country should state those boundaries . This is to also protect the law and the government itself from unwanted blasphemy. Like America making fun of their own president does not only reflect on trump bt it also reflects on all of america on how respectful u guys are to the very president that you guys elected. You spoke about micro aggression bt u have yet to explain your point. And you said the person has rights to use or disregard the advise. Thats true. Bt the fact that you are asking someone for advice means you have atleast 1% hope that the person have some knowledge on the topic and could give a pointer that could help you. Because if you dun believe so it defeats the purpose of asking for an advice. Thats would simply means she is cross examining him and not asking for an advice. You see freedom of speech doesn't mean you are always right. If what you say is fundamentally wrong that means you lost the arguement. Bt because freedom of speech exist you can never conclude an arguement. Becuase at the end of the day one person is going to say that they are offended while the other is going to look stupid not knowing if he actually served any purpose at all. Regardless of who is right or wrong. It always ends like that. And this is why JP was right in his famous interview that people will indeed be offended when theres an opinion or a freedom to place a statement out in the public. So even if JP get offended its totally fine. As long as he tries not to set a new law just to protect himself from an offensive speech... and he on the other hand has every right to choose to answer or ask her to rephrase and she has every right to rephrase or ask the same question or stop asking anything at all. Its her freedom off speech to be even silent in this open conversation. And please note that its ur freedom of speech to share ur opinion even if it somehow ends up being a micro-aggression ...ofcourse i wouldn't know the exact limitations of the freedom of speech in US . I am not from there. Especially in certain Places there are restrictions and codes that you cannot use. Bt frgt about that. One of ur responds said that the JP was actually acting politically correct which is what he is against. The fu. Y thing is he did it thnx to freedom of speech. Bt he didn't ask for a bill to be passed for him to make the comment. Thats a different think. He believes that you dun need a law to be politically correct... how ever now come the funny part. When he asks her to rephrase thats nothing to do with PC because if a question contradicts its purpose then answering it becomes invalid. This is social science. Beyond what you believe there is always a truth that is constant and appears from the beginning. Somewhat gives a theoretical explanation to god himself. One with no beginning and one with no ending. Formulas are created in the efforts to find truth. And for us to relate with bt we also tend to create our own truth. And when that conflicts with science we always tend to blame society for it. How about blaming society for the fact that fire burns you when you touch it. You can't do that right. Cuz the ultimate truth regardless of ur believe is that fire will burn you if u touch it.... by the way ""ur smart for a black person"" doesn't necessarily mean micro aggression. Because u need to consider that situation in which it has been said and the context of it is very important... its not the same as a profanity. U assume its an insult. Becuase u believe that indeed black people are not so smart and that his knowledge spectrum is not one that js specially high.

However, you can’t really tell anyone what they should and should not be offended by. Being offended is based on an individuals subjective understanding of a given situation. I’ll use a scenario and ask you a question to better understand who can be classed as a “snowflake”... “Micro aggressions” can be a good example of this. A micro aggression is a term used to describe both intentional or unintentional derogatory/negative - and often times subconscious - insults aimed at a marginalised group. A statement such as, “you’re smart for a black person” is a micro aggression. While the person making the statement might think they are being complimentary, their subconscious premise is that “black people are not intelligent people.” I think this example is one that shows the disconnect that can exist between people - due to what they see portrayed in media and online and what they hear throughout their lives. By your understanding of “snowflake”, would someone being offended by the the unintended insult “you’re smart for a black person” be a snowflake or justly offended?",UCLfkZiaBRnzVLbji6rMKs4w,1,UgztQZRN04-llRNQf0B4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Again, at this point I'd like to reiterate your assertion of ""Why is someone offended by an opinion when he is a proponent of free speech and political incorrectness"", which speaks to a lack of understanding of both free speech and political correctness, assuming that one is to give up the right to offense in support of the latter. _""I’m confident in my understandings, you evidently feel like you need yours validated.""_ That's an ad hominem, lol. Good to note that I've also rarely made assumptions of your character, like you do me. From my supposed worldview to my insecurities.

His main issue with political correctness is prescribed speech, and less so on proscribed speech, enforced by legislature and authority on a purely subjective topic. If you conflate political incorrectness with antagonizing speech, that's a misunderstanding. Perhaps that's your issue with Dr. Peterson. That political incorrectness and freedom of speech means the right to offend. Which you would be right, and so has an individual the right to be offended. The emotional reaction was never part of the equation, but the legal (among other things) ramifications. Obviously if a reaction leads to a breakdown of an exchange of dialogue or ideas, or even into threats, then it leads to a social issue. That is different from calling out the offender and engaging it directly. _""Again, I’m not trying to change your outlook""_ Nor I you.

It is not a fact, but an opinion, despite how much you want it to be, lol. Ironically, that is an ad hominem fallacy, and also runs parallel with the discussion at hand, of Dr. Peterson reacting to a perceived insult. Is what you're doing ""political correctness""? You're obviously offended, and reacting in a way that rebukes it, as Dr. Peterson did. I understand your point just fine, that Dr. Peterson is a hypocrite, reacting towards a politically incorrect statement in a way that he chastises the politically correct. I reject the premise the the statement presented to Dr. Peterson is politically incorrect in the first place. I'm not sure how much clearer I can be throughout my past few replies, and oddly enough you seem to keep circling back to his reaction. His reaction, and subsequent actions is entirely irrelevant considering the pretext. Something offensive is not inherently politically incorrect. You've defined it yourself in relation to a minority, and I would think Dr. Peterson does not consider himself to be constituted as part of that any particular minority group. There is also no avoidance or censorship of dialogue or ideas. To be offended, on the other hand, is perfectly fine. It's entirely separate from the issue of political correctness as inherent to human emotions. To not be offended, is something you can not enforce onto others via legislation or otherwise, which forms the foundation of the political correctness ideology. _""You clearly lack the basic ability to understand opposing world views""_ And what world view is that? Cute buzzword, but I don't think it means what you think it means. This is simply a disagreement on your logical train of thought, not an overarching ideology. Your flawed approach in pushing a narrative does not constitute as such, sorry. _""cause you evidently still puzzling""_ I do not ""still puzzling"". I've reiterated your point, and why it's logically unsound with your own definitions. Un-puzzled that. _""Show me where I said that seeking recourse is to be politically correct""_ Not only seeking recourse, but taking offense in the first place, the full quote being ""Being offended and seeking recourse is not to be politically correct"". In your own words: _""why is he so offended by her opinion - when he is for freedom of speech and political incorrectness?""_ The latter proposition is phrased as a false implication, implies that his taking offense runs against freedom of speech and political incorrectness as a contradictory argument (p -> ~q, false), p being offended, and q being political correctness. Hence, via modus ponens, (p -> q), with p = true, hence q = true, his taking offense would mean to embrace in part the ideas behind political correctness.

What’s “banal” to me, might not be “banal” to you” – Which only means that before asking him a question she was supposed to either previously check with him on his understanding of “banal” or simply not use that word at all. After all, as I have said many times earlier, it was her asking him a question, so she had to ""play by his rules"", not the other way around. “Ultimately, she has the right to label his words “banal” if that’s how she feels - that’s her freedom of speech. He had the right not to respond if he didn’t want to.” – In which case she would have ended up simply having wasted everyone’s time because of being impolite. Jordan, in fact, saved her face by giving her a chance to reformulate her question. Of course, she has the right to label his words whatever way she feels, but that's not the point here. The point here is that she used her freedom in a wrong setting. You have your freedom of speech, but if you start exercising that freedom in a wrong setting - say in a library where everyone is supposed to be quite, than you will quickly be removed.

It’s simply a loaded question. Where did you get it that “he was offended by her opinion”? First, why “offended”? Did he say anything like “I won’t continue unless this lady stands up and leaves”? Did he even raise his tone? He was calm as rock and told her that it was rather hard for him to answer politely a question that ends with “your comments are banal”. He was still being polite. He didn't start paying her back by saying something like ""Well, to answer such a banal question, I would say that..."". So, how does that amount to “being offended”??? You seem to be misrepresenting what really happened here. Heck, he even gave her another chance! Do offended people act like that? And secondly, offended “by her opinion”??? Where do you see that he was offended exactly by her opinion? He was simply not happy about her choice of words in how she formulated her opinion, but not about the fact that she had that opinion. Her opinion was still there after she reformulated it, yet Jordan did not refuse to respond to that opinion and did give her quite a broad answer.

Your opinion of Jordan Peterson’s “clean your room” statement is that it wasn’t “banal”, hers was the opposite and that’s okay. Banal” is a subjective term. What’s “banal” to me, might not be “banal” to you. For example, I might like R&B music, you might think it’s “banal”. But neither of those is an “accurate” answer - it’s all subjective.

You might be surprised the find that the term ""political correctness"" is not formally defined, and nuances exists between the different dictionaries and proponents / detractors of said concept.

You do not get to dictate anything, as if you ""stating"" something makes it true. In this instance, the usage of ""banal"" and the reduction of Dr. Peterson's observations as ""clean your room"" is a mischaracterization. Legally, misleading statements and false statements hold in court if it satisfies certain criteria.

Heck! The notion of politeness came about long before the notion of political correctness. It's the basics of interaction between humans in any society. You don’t need to be politically correct when you write a book, in which you lay out your thoughts and theories or when you are in such a setting when a bunch of people have congregated around you – like on this video – to listen to you or to ask you questions. Jordan had said repetitively that it's simply impossible not to offend anyone when you present your thoughts or ideas in a book or, say, in a lecture format. However, if you are the one asking someone a question, then you need to be polite with him. Moreover, you need to act in the way, which he considers as polite. In other words, you need to “follow his rules of communication” if you want to get some info from him. Or you don’t have to, but then don’t expect your question to be answered either. This is just that simple! And it has nothing to do with political correctness. It just had to do with common sense.

In all honesty, global warming has become an issue and although scientific studies have supported that society's everyday comforts have led to the ""quickening"" of the climate change... we aren't WILLING to give up our comforts to get it done and governments know this. Most government's officials and decision makers know people ultimately will not go ahead with changes if push comes to shove if it affects their lives NOW. Hence why governments will NOT change legislation quick enough to make a difference, their actions are very dependent on whether they get voted into power.... its not about the long term benefit of our planet. Heck, corporations and capitalism in essence is adamant to squeeze every single juice from this planet of ours in order to make profits.... What I'm getting into is... we're all doomed, because we make decisions for short term gains rather than future societies.

Consciously or not, you've made up your mind that Peterson is a schmuck & now you'll look at anything he's ever said or ever will say though that lens.

I went and saw his 28th February Lecture last night and he spoke about this point. You're bang on about you yourself setting your own standards, which is dictated by your consciousness. He spoke of Socrates' 'daimon' - what he personally termed the voice in his own head (conscience) and also explained that the western philosophy of democracy is predicated of conscience - that every human inside them has the ability to know right from wrong (although we may not always share the same exact opinions). If there is something you should be doing, even if you're getting away with not doing it, your conscience will still be racked with guilt. It's not hard to be introspective and see where you're not being entirely honest in your conduct and where you could implement some change. @James Pyke - I'm not sure if you're honestly trying to understand Jordan Peterson's views or if you're just on here to troll others. I think when you honestly devote some time to listening (really listening) to him you will understand that he speaks many undeniable and universal truths.

If you truly want to understand him you have to listen to him or read what he says. I consider myself a JBP fan and I can try to explain some of his positions as I understand them. Specifically you ask about the meaning of putting you own house in order, and I'm gonna say what I think about this though I don't claim to understand it completely, I'm still trying to figure this out just like you. To put a house in order should really be taken as a metaphor - though it's also good advice literary. You had a really good question which is who decides if your house is in order and I truly believe that it is your own conscience that decides it. The question is - are you sorted out - by your own standards? People more often than not would say that they are not sorted out - that is - they know they are not 100% doing what they should be doing and they have problems to attend to which they are not attending to. This is something practical - you can try asking this to yourself every night - is there something I should I had done which I didn't or something I wish I hadn't done which I did? If you are still bothered with how you acted during your day this is your conscience telling you that you could have done better. It's a great sign to pay attention to to tell us what we can improve on. So, having said all that, I would define sorting yourself out (or putting your house in order, i see these as analogous metaphors) as the process of solving your personal problems - those that really bother you and you know you can fix - until you reach the point where you are really good at solving problems which concern you primarily. Then you can your family's problems start to become your problem and you are increasingly no longer a problem for your family but a solution to your family's problems and you increasingly take it up yourself to negotiate with them and try to fix the problems. It's crucial to understand that while you don't have yourself sorted out you are more of a problem for someone else, rather than someone who can fix someone else's problem. Why? because you are a problem to yourself - you haven't fixed yourself sufficiently to be of any positive utility to the outer community. Also the meaning of taking responsibilities that goes beyond you as an individual, as I understand it, is that you are turning a problem that is larger than yourself and that other people have into your own *personal* problem - so that you care so much about the problem that you act is if it really concerns you. And then since it concerns, it will also bother your conscience when it's not being attended to and your conscience will impel you to fix it. This is my little rant, trying to articulate these concepts and I hope it can be of a little utility to you James and anyone who cares to read.",UCg5mMKardb5fEk6XtT4DJmQ,1,UgzURUmgfGUCkvJlZo14AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

So it would be like someone who is not a climate scientist, say a psychologist for example, with a huge almost cultish following, making claims about climate change? Getting them wrong and convincing his followers to make it much worse. But also on your analogy. You are saying a normal person cannot make his car more efficient. That can only really be done at the point of manufacture. Unless you get your “house in order”, spend at least 3 years becoming a mechanic. Another several getting experience. Then 4 years getting an engineering degree. Several more gaining experience. Another 4 years getting an electronics degree. And several $100,000 later you can save $20 a year. Perfectly logical. “What hope of positive global change could you possible seek to achieve, especially if you're not even capable of managing your day to day affairs.”....“maybe your marriage is dysfunctional”….Um never thought of that.

Which do you think is more effective? There may be many things out of your control, e.g. climate change, job market. However if you work on yourself, you'll make something out of it. You could find an untapped market, build a business around it and eventually hire people (create jobs). You can start initiatives in your community for waste reduction, recycling, etc, or even start a company that produces green technologies like electric cars or power efficient devices. There's also a great humility that you learn when you actually work on yourself and try to build something because then you realise how difficult things actually are.

There are many videos where he talks about this but @Ian summarises his point very well. An analogy: You own a car. Obviously improvements can be made to the vehicle and through small tweaks you will be able to gain a tiny percentage of efficiency here or there. However, it is much easier and much more likely that you can do some serious damage to the car so you need to be exceptionally careful when conducting your work. Now imagine that, on top of this information, you throw in the fact that you're not a mechanic. It would seem your chances of making the car more efficient is looking to be less and less. This is his point about getting your own house in order. What hope of positive global change could you possible seek to achieve, especially if you're not even capable of managing your day to day affairs. Maybe one of your children is failing mathematics at school; maybe your marriage is dysfunctional; perhaps you yourself are acting as a negative influence in the world and you just happen to scream about issues so loudly in the hopes that no one will notice.

Which is saying, if your life is in utter disarray and you want to get organised, start by cleaning your room. This is helpful because it is a relatively small task that anyone can achieve to get the ball rolling, even if you're crippled with depression and can barely get out of bed. It also mean essentially, ""Get your own life in order before you go criticising others."" He travels the world talking to people everyday who thank him for his message which has helped them organise their live and become a more positive. This audience member dragged his mantra through the mud suggesting that it's useless information and that it has no bearing on issues at a global level. 1:20 - She reiterates her question, ""Young people have problems to tackle which seem so far out of reach, what is your answer?"" Jordan says, ""It's not as far out of your control as you think. Do you believe that you're worse off than your grandparents."" He's saying that these problems aren't out of your control and that frankly, they're not really big issues compared to ones that our ancestors have faced (granted, I believe climate control is). She mentions declining employment rate and the economy. All he saying here is that people have had it much worse when you look at the history of humanity in it's entirety; even going back a few generations to our grandparents, they face worse. However, by becoming a competent and responsible human you can most certainly make change and standing there flailing your arms saying, ""Argh, it's so hard,"" doesn't achieve much (see his later comments about people who make comments like these generally are avoiding responsibility under the guise that they are doing something).",UCls9629i2wqTusDmL96G0mw,1,UgzURUmgfGUCkvJlZo14AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

In fact he answered the question well to the point the questioner gave him credit. As to answer your question as to what he is saying, which was covered in great detail by his Oxford Union speech and his Cambridge union speech covered climate change as well. Basically it took a lot to get to where we are as a society, and to make it small % better is proportionally harder than to make it much worse. Hence before attempting to change others you should put your room in order ie work on yourself as that affects no one before slowly and very carefully branching out from there ie collective action. But in school you are not taught that, and instead taught simply look at the economic system, clearly you can point out the problems now go radically change it as a 21 year old. Basically changing the order without knowing why it was there in the first place. And this is particularly onerous when they cannot even put their own lives in order but yet attempt to put society's. I add my own view here, that it hints at possibly society is not the problem they are. And even if society was the problem. without having the ability to get your own life in order, your attempt to change society is infinitely more likely to make society much worse than better. Now to Climate Change. At the Cambridge Union address he stated he was on the UN committee and read many studies and worked on many ideas to make the world better. First the wind and solar experiment in Germany ended up producing more Carbon dioxide plus the price of electricity shot up. Also they discussed cost effectiveness with return of value. And they assembled teams which included noble prize economist who assembled their own teams and ranked the problems of the world to be solved on limited resources and the return it brings. A prioritized wish list based on highest social value for money. And climate change did not even make the list AT ALL. Much less rank highly on it. This is covered in great detail in the book How to spend 75 billion dollars to make the world a better place. And the problem is that students or maybe even you will just assume people like him are Charlatans when they are actually deeply studying the problems you all just assume you understand like students. This is a recurring theme in his address when he challenges assumed truths by students which I suggest you watch. In conclusion you seem to be making a lot of assumptions and coming off slightly like a charlatan.",UCAvSiVZTdP8lnyYmtzHvGog,1,UgzURUmgfGUCkvJlZo14AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

The question is essentially rephrased as, ""Your message of accepting individual responsibility doesn't translate to the larger problems which exist on a global scale, so what is your answer?"" He begins by stating that he has observed from his personal career as a Clinical Phycologist that people who learn to adopt personal responsibility become more positive and successful. His message is that as you become more competent at handling your own affairs then you can begin to accept the burden of greater responsibilities, perhaps like starting a family, or taking a management position, or becoming a political representative for a collective of people. This continues to develop until you get to the high echelons of power where you're able to affect real change in the world (Climate Change, Housing Affordability) but this journey begins by taking the first steps. ""I'm suggesting that people who don't have their own houses in order should be very careful about trying to reorganise the world."" He's saying that his philosophy or 'sorting yourself out as an individual' is the catalyst for solving these great problems of our generation; not mutually exclusive. He's then asked if, ""Someone wants to make change in the world but can't wait until they've learned how to manage their own affairs, is it then okay to just try to make the global change anyway.""

Iv heard Peterson respond to similar questions much more articulately and definitively than he did here which I attribute to His sense of the young lady’s clearly adversarial demeanor, but the answer goes more or less like this: becoming cognitively strong/healthy In yourself will allow you to positively affect your sphere of influence, and those in your sphere of influence will then improve as a result of mere contact (via the morphogenetic collective field -sheldrake) and thus better the habits of themselves and so to THEIR spheres of influence. This pattern continues expanding outward in exponentially larger influential waves and within 4-5 degrees of separation the world has improved and the problems, becoming self-evident, have solved themselves. Obviously thats a significantly simplified version of what an entire book could be written to explain but that’s essentially the ideology. Change on a large scale Must start close at hand.

Peterson's response to this young lady to facilitate such is a reminder; IF you wish to tackle the big, moral issues, then sort out your own smaller responsibilities to yourself. ie clean your room (an obvious metaphor for getting ones life in order). Greater buy-in from others and success will be achieved when your friends, family, community etc can observe you living your own genuine, accountable life which then can serve as a model to affect real change to the perceived big ticket issues. One's credibility increases exponentially when their own observable life isn't in chaos. The result?

If you as an individual truly care about climate change, then do something by following advices from scientists, not a psychologist. If you ask a psychologist what you can do as an individual when facing large scale social problems, the correct answer is to ask yourself why you care such an issue in the first place, cause that’s what a psychologist does, dealing with people mentally and subjectively. If you think there is a problem with economics, fine, listen to what economists say, or even better, study the issue yourself, same with issues like climate change. Otherwise, what do you expect to be a good answer from a psychologist? From a therapist? Give you the formula to solve everything? His angel couldn’t be more right, ask yourself why you care.

First off, climate change is a constant and any attempt individual or collectively is to open Pandora's box. If fossil fuels were already a pandora's box, ""combating climate change"" is a completely another pandora's box that no body should want to get into, because it will inevitably cause more harm than good, especially at a collective level. The ability to control the weather is the ultimate doomsday weapon for anyone with global domination in mind. Next, personal responsibility is more important than collective action, because collective actions almost always start out with good intentions but are easily perverted by powerful people.

However, a general understanding of human behavior can effectively indicate when one is signaling, in denial, blatantly biased or perhaps a bit delusional. This IS VERY OFTEN the case. Just analyze the rhetoric of the subject and you’ll eventually ask yourself why they’d rather expend their energy righteously pleading for recognition and appreciation instead of peacefully, authentically spreading general awareness about their belief. Most of us are highly vulnerable to our primitive instincts. We discover our purpose or our belief and we fight in accordance with it. Often this becomes “my belief good, your belief bad... because I know/am better”. And just like that your intelligence, your virtue, it essentially goes right out the window. Despite what your convinced you see in the mirror you are still simply an advanced chimpanzee, historically wired to think like this. I agree with JP.

It's understandable to be frustrated because you can only do long term improvement, but it's almost a property of life. Change takes time. If you want to become good at something (a sport, an instrument, a scientific area etc.), you have to spend time practicing (a lot). If you want to get rid of some of your bad habits, you'll have to work on them one by one and be constant over time. If you want to improve a relationship, you will have to learn to listen to the other, express your needs clearly, and them come to some compromises and take the time to implement them in real life. If you want to have political power, you have to smart small, improve your network, work on your message and your delivery... There are no shortcuts, and beginning with self-improvement and responsibility is already a step in the good direction. I also think that often, over focusing on large scale problems on which one has no power is a distraction of what can be improved and done on a smaller scale.

I don't want us to leave the topic too much with your Japan-argument, but just look at how they dealt with Fukushima to see the problems of what you call ""individual cleanliness"".

Especially in American debates it seems that people reject collective responsibility, because a collective solution might include legislation by the government, and Americans kinda seem to be allergic to that.

It is reassuring to hear that. I can't say that I have ever studied Kant (my apologies). But I have read a quote by him, which suggests that he held Christ in reverence and may have considered himself a believer. However I am aware of the tension that exists between Enlightenment thought in general and the historic Biblical understanding of both human nature and history. (I read Voltaire's 'Candide' in college, among other writings of his, also Rousseau's 'Social Contract', both of them before I became a Christian. I can't say that I was favorably impressed.) As Western Christians delve deeper into our Hebraic roots, I think that we find a great chasm opening between two largely incompatible worldviews. But to confuse Christianity with the 'ancien regime' which preceded the French Revolution would be a grave mistake. I believe that the failure of NOMINAL (or 'cultural') Christianity to observe Biblical precepts of justice, also artificially and unnaturally close identification of of Church with State interests, formed the basis for a lot of revolutionary activity and anti-Christian sentiment during the past quarter of a millennium. One must learn to distinguish the doctrine from its perversion by so-called followers. Observe Jesus' parable of the wheat and the tares growing together in a field until harvest time, when they will be separated. I have not seen a single passage in Scripture endorsing 'religion per se', be it 'organized' or 'private'. Have you? Three verses spring to mind: (James 1:26) 'If anyone thinks himself to be religious, yet does not bridle his own tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless.' (James 3:16) 'For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.' (John 4:23) 'But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.'",UCFC5wRJ2NFzNa6B1sWIt_Hw,1,UgyEWGAcAJrZWLfUHsV4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Reason should be used as a tool to ascertain the truth, rather than as a method of combative humiliation - a matter I expect we are in agreement about. I'm coming from a kantian perspective rather than a prescriptive religious one, and I consider that to be sufficiently righteous. My own conception of the almighty force of creation is sacrosanct, and I also believe that it is rather dicey to make statements on its behalf as a human, and have no doubt that narcissism and tyranny are extremely prevalent within the context of organised religion.",UCMoRrVhH8wrlQ468GipIkXA,1,UgyEWGAcAJrZWLfUHsV4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

I expect neither collective action nor individual human responsibility to resolve the climate-change crisis. Nor do I suppose that climate change is a 'hoax'.

But unfortunately Q&A had an agenda and limited his time to provide a detailed response. Peterson provides very detailed responses, and this Q&A episode did hamper him and I think on purpose. In regards to her grandparents he did make a good argument. However, her grandparents for all we know could be younger ones e.g. baby boomers who've had it very easy. Grandparents who lived in the 1st half of last century, especially those born in Europe, undoubtedly had it tougher than today's younger generations. I think the point Peterson was trying to make before he got cut off was that previous generations have had it much tougher, but they didn't crawl under the bed cry and give up, they fought for their freedom and rights as best they could to make their world a better place.

Iv heard Peterson respond to similar questions much more articulately and definitively than he did here which I attribute to His sense of the young lady’s clearly adversarial demeanor, but the answer goes more or less like this: becoming cognitively strong/healthy In yourself will allow you to positively affect your sphere of influence, and those in your sphere of influence will then improve as a result of mere contact (via the morphogenetic collective field -sheldrake) and thus better the habits of themselves and so to THEIR spheres of influence. This pattern continues expanding outward in exponentially larger influential waves and within 4-5 degrees of separation the world has improved and the problems, becoming self-evident, have solved themselves.

So all we can do as people is spread awareness so the system changes. Many people sadly are ignorant. I am just writing this to explain to some people why there is nothing wrong with activism.

It is an ethical stance against unnecessary cruelty and killing of animals. It is difficult to stand up against unethical cultural practices.

Children do not starve if they eat fruits, nuts and vegetables, and mushrooms, so I don’t know why you said that.

Taking it more seriously than that means one of three things: A) A bias against Dr.Peterson, and an attempt to use the joke against him. B) A lack of social awareness. Exaggerating a statement is a very common form of humor across many cultures. Would you take me seriously if I was to claim that, for example, my dog is 3 meters tall, or understand I'm just claiming my dog is very large, and that I exaggerate my statement for comedic purposes? C) Bad communication; It is very easy to misunderstand the tone in written communication. In-person, I can say the same exact phrase with a different tonality, and you'd be able to interpret if I am being serious, sarcastic, or just humorously referencing something I heard.

Also, the phenomenon you describe is really a natural outcome.

Then, comes a figure who challenges this type of sexism; It's only natural they would see him as a savior of sorts.

Although I'm a millennial, I was able to see early on how bad social media could be. I was one of those snotty kids trolling internet message boards with my friends back in the late nineties. Years later, I was employed in a position where I could see first hand how toxic, unproductive and legally damaging social media could be I never really bought the hype; rather, I only saw risk and an increasing amount of noise. Don't get me wrong, I use social media, mainly YT; I still need to be somewhat aware. I have a few (literally <6) FB friends & family but haven't logged on in years. When I call or visit my loved ones we actually have something to talk about and it feels more meaningful. I always see (pre covid at least) groups of people out and they have nothing to talk about (I imagine that's a side effect of being in constant update mode) so they go back to their smartphones; it's quite the feedback loop. I love the power of the internet and I accept that power must have trade offs. I think social media is great as long as the person can knowingly accept what they are getting out of the platform and what the platform is getting from them. That way, we can think about these trade-offs. Maybe start throwing warning notifications that open up every login. WARNING: Use of this platform for the average user consumes X% of their time on average per day (provide links all the stats). Please be aware, the user of this device could be spending their time elsewhere doing other things. Maybe, when that user hits the average amount of time, a pop-up comes up and informs them they have hit the rolling average. With the numbers being publicly available, I could see having unofficial competitions/rivalries between cities, states and countries where they compete to see who can be off these platforms the most. Imagine the all the productivity, creativity and intellectual gains!

He also means ""remove things that don't serve the function of the room"" and ""order the necessary things to promote the purpose of the room so its purpose can be realized maximally"". This requires a deep understanding of what the room is for and what facilitates that and what hinders it. Most people can't even handle keeping the trash off the floor and never get around to deep understanding. And herein lie two problems when we scale up to communal action: firstly, very few have deep understanding of what society *is* and what changes will *actually* produce.

Cleaning your room as a start to sorting yourself out in no way implies that your motives are good but it does limit the damage if you are bad (whether on purpose or accidentally bad). If your motives are bad, maybe only you suffer. If your motives are good, you may have just done some good. It's win/win. 2 - Yes, the world would be better if people sorted themselves out. Peterson in no way says that we should ONLY and LITERALLY clean our one room. He says it's a START to further social action (or perhaps we should say ""social meddling""). The very simple idea being that if you can't even keep your own room clean, then you have no right and no business telling others how to run their lives. Cleaning your room is practice in other words. It's not as if sports stars who start out as children practicing in little league are banned from moving on just because they practiced in little league! Practice is a prerequisite for moving forward but not a guarantee. 3 - Peterson's advice is true for everyone but it's more applicable to leftists because leftists are more guilty of ignoring this basic advice. Their lives are in utter shambles yet they deign to preach to all of humanity exactly how they must live. They constantly lecture and demand strict adherence to their ignorant and dangerous ideology. This is a tremendous disconnect. It's hypocritical on it's face and Peterson is both calling it out yet being kind in his dispensation of practical advice. 4 - Sorry but stating a mere word like ""responsible"" is not in any way an argument against ""capitalism"". With respect I have to say your #4 here is simply a meaningless statement. It sounds like English is not your first language so maybe that's a factor? 5 - At some level you're right. Her motivation MIGHT not matter if she can truly save the entire world with her mere words. I guess I'd just say the proof is in the pudding. Peterson is simply pointing out that her goal is lofty (perhaps the loftiest possible goal one person can utter) and her skills are lacking (as lacking as they can possibly be...giving the fact that she can't even ask a simple question without being hostile AND committing logical fallacies!). An analogy would be if an 80 handicapped man in a wheelchair who'd never played sports in his life said he was going to become the greatest baseball player in world history by TOMORROW. Sure, it's possible...but only technically possible. In reality, he has the least chance and his goal is simply way too big. Every single one of these SJWs is just like that. They have the least chance, they refuse to practice, they hate everyone and everything including themselves, they can't win friends or allies, they can't take responsibility for even the simplest things directly in front of their face and withing their complete grasp every day (like their own room) and yet they claim and demand everyone listen to them and we'll all be super successful and happy and prosperous and peaceful etc etc etc. The bottom line is that Peterson is merely pointing out the obvious and in a nice way and then offering some practical advice.

People are arguing for a change in legislation that would allow for a transition away from our dependence on fossil fuels (Ex: funding research into renewable and nuclear energy, funding research on carbon capture and sequestration, enacting changes in infrastructure that allow us to rely more on carbon neutral energy, funding reforestation projects, a carbon tax to give a monetary incentive for corporations to reduce emissions, etc). Nobody thinks there’s a simple overnight solution.

You’re still massively affected by the society around you, and it’s in your best interest to play at least a small part in making that society a better place to live in. You don’t have to wait until your interpersonal relations are perfect before you start reading the news and forming political beliefs. Peterson criticizes liberals by saying they don’t want to acknowledge the big issues in life, so they distract themselves with social activism to feel like they’re making a difference. Ironically, his own mentality carries the same problem, but just in a different orientation. The idea of changing the outside world sounds too big and scary, so we should just solve the easy problems of managing our personal lives and just hope someone smarter does all the work.",UCBVEYMjXCpQpZfn7zOY_o0w,1,Ugz-9i-0Fn70bcC5rB54AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

The regular succession hasn't really happened in the recent years. The monetary system has inflated whatever value our labor was once worth, all my peers don't actually own a house (having a loan means it's not yours), own a car or have a yield generating business / asset. This means that almost all of us service loans, loans and more loans with our puny salaries that get ever more puny thanks to inflation and limited pay raise. Just 40-50 years ago, a median home cost a little more than 12 months salary. Today a median home is like 20-40 TIMES the annual income of a person. Housing prices has been inflated to high heavens, while good for those who own houses (read: older generation), it's really difficult for young people to buy houses at that price. So we become lifelong renters (either you pay your landlord or your banker). Either way these money goes to the older generation who owns houses or banks. Won't be a problem if credit is unlimited but that's precisely the problem, credit goes to those who have assets and yield generating business, which means it's not really coming to younger generations. While I agree with JBP's advice in a general sense, there ARE real world problems how society is structured right now that is not good.

But there are other things this opposant of mister Peterson have that may be going with their motivations, and lots of these things could be actually psychological, as it is most of what motivates human behaviour anyway. Not accepting the most true statement or spreading lies, even believing in them, can be the right choice for a person Who desires to gain power, whatever it's personification may be, by the easiest way, most confortable choice. It makes sense for an individual with a certain psycho setting, as power is, at the core, the main relation that exists between humans. For example, a politician can tell lies, he knows it's lies, but can start wars to defend them if it means that he becomes the head of an organisation or something.

And this reflexion doesn't mean that this person should be a president, all of this is probabilities and logical thinking. In scientific studies the statement ""someone should clean this room before trying to change the world"" is actually a method of measure of complex real phenomenons that depend on an infinite number of determinants but that can be predicted by one phenomenon that is observable but that is also highly correlated to the state that the phenomenon studied is in a certain state. So this statement: ""clean your room"" can actually mean in much precise words ""the fact that you have a habit of cleaning your room is known by history to be highly correlated with highly developed personalities, and this determinant is highly correlated with other components that are also highly correlated with successful people. and History shows us that successful people, who have a great probability to be responsible, with integrity, people, are also more probable to have the previous correlated determinants. It all can probably be predicted by the proxy ""the teenager has a habit of cleaning his room, which mean that he has probably a good education and a good enough personal growth rate"" and history show that he has good reason for choosing this predictor. Also, if enough people are cleaning there room, the math says that it is highly probable that a high enough probability will be that these individuals turn into highly effective adults. We have a group here that has significantly more power to influence the world. This actually is a good hypothesis to explaining how wars are won, how ideologies win. These are good predictors. predictors like ""people who are responsible enough to clean their own rooms"" ah, also, cleaning your room means that you are probably a conscientious person, and it is known that conscientious persons tend to be more aware of their deficiencies, and more willing to work on developing them, so there is a good predictor of personal growth rate for you. all from cleaning the room. just shows how the world is complex, and how this person, Mr. Peterson, seems to have a good grasp of this complexity. But, honestly, in this statement, there is a logic that I think is now more in the light for those that didn't grasp it (If I at first was successful at grasping it) but, really, guys, it's like a 1+1=2, it really shouldn't be explained to sane people I think",UCC90OGTvM_i7C7yTHK3HyjQ,1,UgxPZvUXN4_CCom8zRl4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

However, the idea that the solution to a global banking crisis or to global warming, starts with me ""cleaning my room,"" is insanely nonsensical.

It could be as simple as the VA denying them medical services. It could be that they are mentally ill. Or, it could just be that they fell into a spot of bad fortune, and they'll never be able to come out of it. Some people will be poor, and a lot of them are, who don't deserve it. You can't go the other extreme and blame the whole system for this. Because the system in America works better than any other. But, it's a fact that the poor will always be with us. And the poor, many of them do not deserve to be in their position. And there comes a point where there's nothing that can be done to get them out of it.

See, it's this that makes me question your ability to see the actual problems. You see Fast Food as a problem. I see hunger as a problem. When you give money to a homeless man, assuming you do. Where will he spend it? At a fast food restaurant. And yes, food is one of the things that built this nation. Because people, on average, are well fed. You can call it a disgusting industry, but it feeds a lot of people. And well, too.

It's treatable now; and I don't think fast food is what's giving people cancer. More likely stress and other things are giving people cancer, which is one of the things we can actually fix in this country, by mandating people have at least one day off a week, and mandatory vacation time.

As a measure I keep about 5 dollars in my glove compartment, so when I see a homeless man on the street I can give it to him. And, people are very generous. That homeless person isn't starving. Probably has 10 shelters in the area he can go to. The reason why Jordan is talking like this, is because America is good, and special. It's a place that didn't need fixed. It might have a lot of billionaires, but it has a lot of millionaires too, and more people making enough money to support and feed and shelter their family. Jordan's afraid of people like you, who want to change it. And he has good reason to, because you've been brainwashed by KGB propaganda. Compared to the rest of the world, our homeless are rich. It's something you should really consider before you go trying to change something, that you don't know the first thing about. And yes, you need to fix yourself.

They're not, most of you, educated enough to know how to fix the country. And assuming it needed fixed, that's another issue. There were issues, but it was compounded by activism. It wasn't helped. We had racism nearly dealt with in the 90s, until it was rehashed under Obama, and then enflamed under Trump. Your activism isn't working. It's just making the country worse. And that's why Jordan is right. If you want to fix the world, make it more like the United States. Not the United States more like the rest of the world. The problems in this country started under Bush with the Patriot Act. It was fine, until that happened. And activism should be used to promote freedom, which it isn't being used for.

I would argue that to the world their personal carbon consumption matters much more than whether they “ have cleaned up their room”. I think you should start to clean your room by not harming others. By cleaning up the public mess you produce first, before dealing with your private mess. As our societies and economies are built on the exploitation of the atmosphere as a cheap trash dump, this is quite hard to accomplish and requires a kind of ascetic lifestyle, especially in the US, where more sustainable infrastructure totally lacks. - demanding profound politcal change that makes it easier or possible for you not to harm or negativly affect others, should be a priority. because let us be frank we all harm this earth and its inhabitants by our unsustainable lifestyles and it is nearly impossible for us not to cause harm to our earth!

In an oxford discussion he referenced bjorn lomborg on his research with climate change and he found that the best way to address climate change is to reduce poverty, because as people gets richer, the concern on environment increases, so he said to make a humane case of increasing the general wealth across nation, and then hopefully everyone can then band together and find a solution. You also claim that the system that hold our world together are corrupt. Well depends on which system. A system is corrupt when you need to exert power to climb the hierarchy and yes hierarchy can tilt toward corruption, but we have, at least in western society, mechanisms in place to prevent that from happening. Your demand for change is also a reflection of his word that before you criticize the world you can start criticizing yourself. You like to blame it on the people on top, the CEOs, the 1 percent. But what about the scientists? what about the researchers? You don't think they are working day and night to find the solution to this climate change? and these CEOs are massively funding these researches. So its better for you as an individual to learn science, research about climate change and hopefully find the solution yourself. But I think you won't do it because you probably hate science and mathematics as a kid yet screams for other people to find the solution to climate change that requires science and mathematics, pretty ironic.",UCUqk13_HcONQrg0NNDSLfow,1,UgwqmHf0CGK2FmjBc654AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

But I disagree that becoming more virtuous or putting your life in order is enough to stop climate change and mass extinction or the end of resources. That is why I think we should do both - change ourselves, get educated, do something local and meaningful BUT also do whatever we can to change our society to avoid the crash. In one interview he said that we won't run out of fossil fuels. Despite the current research. In another - that we can't solve the climate problem and therefore we should just focus on other things. First of all, there is science and there are opinions. Who is he to claim those things? Teaching responsibility is one thing, but discouraging people to address the problems of our society is just heartbreaking! It is also a bit suspicious.

Because he was aggressive and dodged the question even though everyone else understood it and how important it is. He is educated and intelligent and his reaction to her genuine view of the world was unlike any time he is asked to talk about topics that are actually in his field. Take his most famous dialogue - with Cathy Newman for example - there he was a lot more understanding and calm and explanatory even though the reporter was being exactly the opposite. And he talked in depth about the most obvious things. Whereas in this short video he just put up a claim and barely looked into the problem. And fair enough, he is a clinical psychologist, that isn't in his field. Well I agree. Why then do we take his word for be all and end all of the matter? He is no political figure and yet he is. This clip to me was indicative of one thing - as much as there is use for ordinary people like me in his words (to learn to take care of yourself and your life)... there is also use for people in power teaching you that the state of the world has never been better. And we should preserve it and should be grateful for the systems that hold it together. And whoever wants to better the world is a naive fool. But that is the problem. he systems that hold our world together are corrupt, not because of the patriarchy but because they are based on endless economic growth - something incompatible with the real world. Climate change and the extinction of wildlife, pollution even - these things all represent the greatest market failure. And capitalism is almost all sunshine and rainbows when we ignore those - it is still a flawed model but probably the best one we have had up till now.... until you take THESE into account. So yes, maybe whoever hopes for change is naive. But not because change is bad. Just because people in power wouldn't want it. So now we have one charismatic and really educational speaker here to put us to sleep with tales of the beauty of the world, how ungrateful we are and how we don't work hard enough and know way too little to have the RIGHT to talk or act. Here is the thing though. I want to learn, to clean my room and get my life together. I could lead a happy life doing that. But one day my children won't have that luxury. Even today kids are being sold sugar and video games and drugs and getting addicted to porn - this is at the heart of capitalism. Brands look at people like on animals with primal desires. That is a system we are embeded in. And as soon as the human in you wakes up - you go to listen to Jordan Peterson and how to get rid of your addictions. He helps you out, then he tells you how to integrate yourself in that same society that raised you this way. And then he tells you that everything is fine. I love my life as it is. But I know that this is only a period. What this woman is bringing up is way more important than the gender pay gap or whatever gets people to click nowadays. Climate change and demographic changes and end of resources - it is already happening. And this is the first thing we should talk about. We don't have a sufficient solution and he is just trying to make people forget about it.",UCdNezrTCzBF9tmNZ1WVOu3w,1,UgwqmHf0CGK2FmjBc654AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

The posmodernist ideology revolves around the belief that everybody is equal and that relativism permeates society (morality wise mostly). Egalitarian marxism is a concept that states that in a society absolutely everything should be equal to everybody. For example, there should be an equal proportion of females and males in all jobs. He constantly dismantles this idea by showing the statistics that negate the ""cultural"" side of this ideology to show that biologically and psychologically men and woman have different interests and therefore, the careers they choose have big disproportions. He constantly states that people arent equal and that forcing equity to get equality of outcome isnt going to benefit people. The coherence reference is founded on the fact that the posmodernist ideology doesnt have coherence since to them everything is relative. He criticizes this in the sense that this type of thinking not only doesnt benefit people but also doesnt have any psychological background. 2. He isnt saying much on his own but just stating what the radical left (usually posmodernist) believes as a worldview. As they believe intelligence isnt a real thing and people are just equally capable, they think the ""system"" we live in today is a product of tyrannical rule from certain upper classes.

But where is your line of distinction between people who 'have it together' (integrated persons, if you will) and those who are 'disordered' in behavior (by contrast, 'disintegrated'). I see no clear line of demarcation, not even based on criteria with which you might be comfortable. An individual might find 'success' and a sense of 'order' in one aspect of life, yet demonstrate lamentable incompetence and 'disorder' in another. If you study the lives of celebrated artists (to give one example) you will often find this pattern. But would you consider pursuit of the arts a worthy endeavor? Even hardline philosophical materialists and fanatics of the environmental movement might find some place for the arts, albeit in a peripheral role, or as an adjunct to their primary endeavors. I suppose that the 'worthiness' of artistic labor depends (from the worldly perspective) on what is achieved from a productive standpoint, or from the standpoint of reputation and influence; from the Christian perspective, on whose service and glorification is the end result. Service and glorification of SELF would be a low goal, of OTHERS a median goal, and of GOD a supreme goal. Arguably, by achieved the highest one takes care of the other goals in some fashion, the will of God (and NOT the virtue of the individual) being the INTEGRATIVE principle. 'Seek first the kingdom of heaven and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.' If I may, I would suggest that you are taking Matthew 7:11 a little out of context, because He is urging people to have confidence in the Lord. You are not doing that. Perhaps my personal experiences of elite 'expertise' have left me jaded in many cases rather than inspired. Many visits to mental facilities, glorified prisons, have allowed me to observe 'cures' worse than the ailment being treated. Even while trying desperately to do what is right in their own estimation, to follow 'best practices', to please the 'democratic majority', men often FAIL miserably. This is evident to anyone willing to open eyes and ears. What the Reformers called 'total depravity' Jesus taught more efficiently in Matthew 7:11--------------------'IF YOU THEN, BEING EVIL'..........'. Do not miss His point, or you will be missing the forest for the trees. Have you read Paul's letter to the Romans, especially chapters 1-7? One ought to read them before proceeding to chapter 8, I think. In this case sequential instruction does work very well. But if you go on to chapter 10, you will find a very good argument AGAINST free will. Or let us rather say that we often exaggerate the EXTENT of our moral liberty. How can we seek salvation when we do not even know that we are in chains?? How can we seek 'good' when we do not know what that is? Good for you, for staying slim. Everyone slims down a lot post-mortem. Death is the great equalizer. (Romans 6:23) 'For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.'",UCFC5wRJ2NFzNa6B1sWIt_Hw,1,UgwkxWrPZoFLhqVybUt4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Maybe it is also a question of the subjective coloration which we attach to words. To attempt to resolve disordered human relationships the way an engineer would approach bridge construction might not work so well. 'Pragmatism' will never render ethics obsolete, still less the Pauline trio of faith, hope, and love. If you are saying that moral hypocrisy exists among the millennial generation, some of whom promote fatuous ideas, I won't argue with you. But I think that it is more widespread than that. (Romans 3:23) 'For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' The young do not need to look to the example of 'older and wiser' like Peterson, but to the example of CHRIST. You speak highly of self-improvement. Christian teaching does not recommend that to excess, for the inherent moral corruption of man can never be removed by human effort. Jesus commented that even wicked people know how to give good gifts to their children. So, if they try harder, do you think that they will give still better gifts? Jesus also said that unless one is ,born again' he cannot see the kingdom of God. The very act of baptism signifies death and burial of the 'old' nature centred upon self. Self-righteousness is one of the deadliest of sins because those who consider themselves adequate in themselves have no incentive to seek God's help. Seeking God is a responsibility from which many wish to be dismissed. Btw some people are not so fortunate as you or I, but predisposed genetically to become overweight.

Therefore, if we live our whole lives without considering eternity, we will have wasted it entirely, 'for it is appointed for men to die once, then judgment'. (John 3:16) 'For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.'

They predicted it in the 80s, 90s and 00s and every prediction was flat out wrong this new prediction of 12 years is just another fear tactic to scare idiots into willingly accepting extreme measures and handing over more money and power to the ruling class, if you can’t see that then you’re another gullible fool 🤦🏻‍♂️ That being said there are good reasons to cut down on CO2 emissions and move to more renewable forms of energy, but the fact is the west has already taken large strides towards that goal! The largest contributors to global CO2 emissions are India and China, in the west we’re already on track so if you’re going to argue for cutting back on CO2 emissions you need to bring relevant arguments such as air quality and environmental preservation, but saying the worlds gonna end and we need to stop using planes and combustion engines is a ridiculous statement, first off that would effect how we handle logistics in every single industry farming in particular would suffer massively and would lead to food shortages causing mass starvation! Your issue is you’re not thinking through the real ramifications of enacting such radical changes in how we operate or how much tyrannical force it would take to ensure everyone would agree to follow such ridiculous policies, so unless you truly believe the world gonna end and you support authoritarianism as a resolution then you’re argument makes no sense and if you do believe that then you have bigger issues 😂",UCEffeDxN3gTLu8F1Ah6tJow,1,UgwgrmZgb-3oN-KHC7B4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

The left seems to think that if we learn some chants, hold up some signs, and blow some air horns, that's activism. It isn't. And you know it isn't, because when you ask those so called activists real basic questions they can't answer them. A true thing, poorly expressed, is a lie. You shout about how Black Lives Matter until you're blue in the face, but if you can't answer a basic question of ""What do you want?"" (as in, ""What's your end game?"") then that's a true thing poorly expressed and is thus all your efforts are a lie. Activism takes the ability to be organized.

She basically asked if Peterson had any advice for people on large scale and/or global issues such as climate change other than ""clean your room"". In terms of race, I believe they're a social construct. There are differences such as skin colour and physical attributes, mostly seen in facial structures. I'd be very interested to see you provide some proof that shows that your ""race"" also determines your IQ. In terms of gender, males and females have differences, definitely, and I doubt there are a lot of people out there claiming that men and women are exactly the same, and anyone claiming so are obviously wrong. However, the gender gap definitely exists. Not in the sense that women are paid less than men for the same job, but that women overall are paid less, because there are a much higher percentage of men in higher paid positions compared to women, for example in CEO positions.",UCpxgw_MaRM7bfWElAxpFRSw,1,UgxE73dYwArB3Rblojh4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

In this context personal responsibility simply means to take ownership. If you have damaged relationships in your life or are at odds with neighbors or family members, if you take the personal responsibility to own your faults and fix the situation, your life and theirs may improve. Or, on a simpler topic, if you see trash blowing across the lawn and realize ""hey, I think that's mine"", be responsible and pick it up. These personal choices to ""do the right thing"", in theory, and if extrapolated throughout a society, would lead to a collective responsibility due to the sum of it's responsible individuals. Now, do I believe this is 100% possible? No way. People are people. Lazy. Selfish. Greedy. Apathetic. That's just the reality of humanity.

""What is your argument that he would not?"" Yes, that is my argument exactly. If Paine had taken JP's advice he'd have buckled down to his father's corset business in London or chosen some other profession and concentrated his energies on making a success of himself. He would not have turned to drink and gambling and run up debts he could not pay. He would not have been forced into debt peonage and to immigrate under penalty of law to the colonies as an indentured servant. He would not have been made to serve as an apprentice in a printing shop to pay those debts. He would not have met Benjamin Franklin who patronized that shop. He would never have conceived a passion for American independence as the result of his lived experience. He would never have written Common Sense or The Age of Reason the essays most most credited with swaying colonial opinion in favor of revolution. The consequence to American history of erasing Paine's role in it cannot be overstated. Are you getting my drift? There is a saying: ""Sometimes you have to make wrong turns to get to the right place"". In JP's world those wrong turns are pulled over, ticketed and you are put back on track. I'm amused by your suggestion that I make a ""stronger interpretation"" I've watched dozens of hours of JP's videos and debates and speech making. I read his books and articles. I read critiques of his books and articles. Why, you may ask? Because I wanted him to be brilliant. I thought the intellectual and academic culture of the West had become flaccid, dogmatic, uninspired. I hoped that JP was fresh, new and unafraid and would breathe life back into a rundown society staggering under the weight of sacred cows and political taboos. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered all he was offering was a rehash of homespun homilies and ancient moral fables that have been around for 2000 years mixed with shlock motivational speak, quack psychology and sociobiological claptrap about how hierarchies in lobsters has some relevance to how human societies can function best. I don't deny that some are helped by JPs 12 rules but some are also helped by astrology and seances. Gertrude Stein famously said : ""There is no there, there."" At least no there that wasn't there all along, in a million different places in a thousand different languages for 30 centuries before JP figured out how to make a buck out of it and get famous.",UCI4gPi01UDuazhDGJEVOwlg,1,UgzxTuVfEpT5s9X-xs94AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

There is no historical evidence to support the notion that people with balanced checkbooks who make their bed and brush their teeth contribute more to society or achieve more success in any field of endeavor. Its just popular common sense myth supported by anecdote. About as profound and insightful as a stitch in time saves nine. Ground breaking stuff. You may be happier or more well adjusted if you can tie a good shoe but great things are no more often achieved by happy well adjusted individuals than by unhappy poorly adjusted individuals as any study of genius will show.

I would interpret Dr. Peterson’s comment to mean that people often attach themselves through toxic emotion — a practice that could be called cathexis — to external things (people or material wealth) as a way of distracting themselves from the pain of resolving their own internal issues. As an example, if you were to go to the average modern day businessman what do you think the chances are that you will find a secure individual who has self esteem irrespective of his financial success? At the core of the modern day big businessman is often an intrapsychic self image that feeds on narcissism. Rather than confront and attempt to work through this dilemma, which is a very difficult and anxious process, it is much easier to attach to other like-minded narcissitic individuals — where the expression ‘shallowness loves company’ has its roots — who rely on outmanouvering and controlling others rather than addressing and repairing their own toxically damaged internal cores. ‘Clean your room’ is just a way of saying stop divesting your emotional energy supply away from where it’s sorely needed — on working your way to a deeply contented adult life — by attempting to attach to, defeat and control others. This is where a fascination with money and power becomes a proxy device to try (and fail) to gain control over your own inner chaos by first projectively identifying it onto others and trying to control them. It is also the best way to remain permanently stuck. 'clean your room"", in the sense of facing up to the above, is a process that has not even been started by the biggest practicer of cathexis we've seen for a very long time: mr d. trump.",UCzmmIIqM-XCNtaooBnKMpoA,1,UgxfpTKPrWMqAmG2qMl4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Civil Engineers who just graduated from college who seem to think that they are going to start out as ""shot callers"" rather than as some experienced engineer's assistant. They want ""x"" number of days of paid vacation, profit sharing and a company car etc...etc...etc... That isn't realistic, yet in the age of YouTube millionaires etc...some of these newly minted civil engineers (it would seem) believe that the world owes them something. It doesn't and you have to earn it, or inherit it.....or you can invent something. This (I believe) comes from the idea that ""everyone is special""....participation trophies etc...etc... EARN IT!!! People have become far to entitled and coddled.....or more simply put....SPOILED. You see it throughout western society. The gender studies major who is ""baffled"" that they can't find a good paying job.....(((SHOCKER))) and has tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. Then, those people want to vote for politicians who want to erase that debt for votes....but those politicians just can't say how they'll do it, other than by raising taxes on those of us who have worked all of our lives, making our way up the ladder that these new grads seem to want to avoid. If you're going to build something, and this includes a life....start with a good foundation, like an education in a field where you will earn something because it's in demand. Take heed though.....those fields aren't easy, THAT is why they are well paid.",UCEPNyfxk-iTojDdrBH9afng,1,UgzBRy1RfL9saj8nRrd4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Yes, it has been replaced with another issue, but it's not the same issue. Let's take the climate issue as an example. What is there that you as an individual can't affect? Purchase things from a company that does good things for the climate, or at least as little harm as possible. Avoid those that do. If that means lower quality of life, so be it, that's the choice of an individual. If more individuals do that very thing, would it not have a collective effect on the climate issue?

Problem is 99% of activists never get passed the ""there is a problem do something!!!!!!"" stage and just use it as one more talking point in an armada of complex political issues they pretend to understand, ranging from military action in Syria to gendered income differences to racial crime statistics. If people would stop wasting hours every day screaming about politics on Twitter and youtube and just look at their own lives for things they can actually readily fix, we'd be much better off and everyone wild be a lot happier with less hate being thrown around.

Idk if you play video games but it makes a really good comparison. Say there's a video game and, you've never played before but it seems really interesting and worth your time. The point of the game is to win/overcome with success, the challenges within the game. Tackling such vast and large problems like climate change as a teen right out the gate and with a sense of urgency is like jumping to the final level, into a video game you've never played before, never having even played video games, on hard mode, and didn't take the time to learn the mechanics of. Typically, that would cause your player/character to immediately fail and fail repeatedly, not to mention make you feel hopeless of ever winning. What he said was clean your room, and continue, as you're able, to add responsibilities to that gradually. So, like in a video game, you start at level 1 on easy mode and then your skill gradually improves and you defeat the game. AND if you feel up to it, play the game again at a higher level and faster pace.

You can have a 2 way conversation with the universe. Be cautious of course, but don't be afraid of it. The whole universe and everything in it is a part of you, like another layer of skin. Learn. Seek. Question everything. Assume everything you know about what passes for reality is wrong. It likely is. Reality starts from your heart. Start there. Thats real. Work your way out from there.

The subconscious mind forms the basis of the conscious mind aka the ego.

It's just the background programming. Layers of an onion. Return to your soul. To source. It can be done through steady practice of meditation and reprogramming the subconscious first 7 years of life. Do this, and you become one of the most powerful and enlightened humans on the planet. Just remember, it is the journey to get there that is the point, not the destination itself. When the student is ready, the Master will appear.

But what I'm saying is that the works of an individual can grow into the works of the collective. Thus forth an individual can make a difference. Using your gym analogy. Yes no one can make you exercise, you have to choose to do so yourself. But some one had to be taught about exercise by someone, even if that is by reading a book. Also it had to be made seem cool for you to want to do it. Maybe a person saw a model or movie star in a magazine or video that inspired them to sart exercising? Maybe the doctor told a person you need to make some health changes if you want to live longer? The point it we humans learn from others, but it has to start by from an individual's influence first. Maybe one influencal person isnt enough, but it has to start with one before it adds up to more. To go back to what JP is stating, you have to get your personal life in order before you can affect big change in the world. That doesn't mean these larger issues have to be ignored until you perfect your own life. What JP is saying is that you will learn skills and traits that will help you expand your individualism changes into collective changes. Skills like consistancy, organization, clear goal setting, and persuassion (because you have to persuade your self constantly for big change). When enough ""individuals"" change, then by default the ""collective changes"". One seed planted in the dessert is just one plant, but over time it can become a forest. So your right about the collective being the ultimate change, JP is just making a point about the process of getting there, it always starts with one before it turns to many. In other words as cliche as it sounds, it starts with the man or woman in the mirror. The art of persuassion and transformational story telling is a tactic any sales person or politican knows, but on a larger scale those same tactics can grow into a propaganda machine or social change movement. Those same tactics can help you generate large amount of money which can in turn be reninvested to market your persassion on a bigger scale or buy out others to do the same. We prefear people make heart change choices of course, but lets be honest, some change only takes place with money. Money which can be accumilated and used to pay others to march foraward. I.E Disney which started with an indiviudal, but as he formed his vision into a company, and then expanded that vision through film and media, fastforward some years with that company making money and reinvesting its money to expand, and boom, the man ""Walt Disney the indiviudal"" is long dead, but the ""collective"" (the Disney Company) lives on is constantly influencing the masses. But it started with one. It was the process to get there thst one man took snd through that jounrey persuaded others to join him until they became a massive collective for real socisl change (well in the entertainment world at least which still counts as a propaganda machine depending on how you look at it). This type of thinking also empowers the person, versus having a victim mindset, which is what the girl in the video had. That was the area JP was trying to pont out.",UCoryLi4z1l5lRDsgZumY3KA,1,Ugz9F5EYSzEZlwET0B14AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Take Jesus for Christianity, Mohammed for the Islamic religion, Buddha for Buddhist, and so on.

Christians aren’t persecuted cause they’re evil or because there were wars fought in the name of Christianity centuries ago, and people are mad about it. They’re persecuted because this is a spiritual battle of good vs evil, and the only threat to Satan (evil team) is true Christians. It’s a spiritual battle. That’s why liberals who choose the side of Satan (even though they don’t believe in hin) will defend and protect Islam even though Islam kills gays and harms women. Since there are only 2 teams (good and evil), then technically liberals and Muslims are on the same team agains Jesus and truth. None of them are aware of this because it’s ona spiritual level and they only recognize the physical. Also, if you learn about God and Christianity and the ins and outs of all of it, then you’d find out out that we live in what we call a “fallen world” of “fallen state” of being. Christians believe that God did create a perfect creation, but that mankind betrayed God and that’s what led to death, disease, war, and everything evil we see in the world. God is a God of order as well, so He can’t go against Himself and just return the world to perfection. There are rules. Satan is the official god of this world we live in, so he has authority over it. This world is insane because Satan runs it. That’s why Jesus came to die for us so we could have a way out of this death cycle. Plus, there’s tons of spiritual evidences that you can find which will show that there is a major spiritual world behind our physics world. So maybe look into things like “spiritual warfare” and see what you think. Humble yourself and pray to God to reveal all things to you and to lead you away from all deception, and into all truth and righteousness. ✌🏻",UCaT8ueAU1iBdhS9iP7n29zg,1,Ugwou0iJzqs7ALmvPQN4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Blaming a group of people as a whole for their beliefs or lack of such as well as the actions of others. You cannot place the evil of some godless men at the feet of all those who do not believe. I understand Christianity and I do not oppose the good it does in the world. What I do oppose is zealots who have no idea what they are talking about and generalizing all who disagree with them. I know Christianity is nothing as it was in distant history and share the company of Christians with no opposition and even once believed myself. But I am now as certain god does not exist as you could ever be certain he does and as a Christian you should have no problem with that or you are not the good Christian you claim to be. I myself know what is right and wrong and need no doctrine to follow nor dogma. Perhaps read your own comments and reach your own conclusions why Christians are persecuted. It is not because they are being too nice.

You’re blaming God and Jesus who is perfect, for actions of evil fallen men just cause they claim to be following God. That’s like blaming me, an American patriot whose done nothing wrong, for drug dealing and bomb dropping that the CIA does. Just cause we’re both Americans. Should we blame normal journalists for being lying scumbags because this group over at CNN can’t stop creating fake news? It’s common sense to separate the differences between people who claim to represent a certain group. I’ll never reject my faith and what you say presents zero problem to me and my faith. Christians are the #1 most persecuted group in the world, while also being the most charitable and loving... and they get murdered for it because they’re real Christians.

Protesting climate change while driving your SUV to work and only eating Mangos from China or Chile is hypocritical. But people in positions of more power still remain who may not feel the same sort of responsibility. That's why the next step after bettering ourselves is to pull others into the same responsibility, ergo, protest. The problem with anthropogenic climate change is that it's so mulitlayered. It's true, that if we all change our behaviour, only eat vegetarian, don't drive cars, don't take planes etc. we could affect climate change quite drastically. The reality is that that's not going to happen. Many will not change because it equals loss of comfort, you won't be able to eat strawberries in winter or fly to visit your aunt in Thailand every other month. There is no immediate reward for renouncing those, that's why for a lot of people it won't be an option. The other thing is, that politicians and large companies have a lot more power, and a lot more responsibility considering climate change. But they are aiming to maximize profit, because that's what businesses do. So it in turn is our responsibility to apply pressure and get them to take up the responsibility they have. The real problem in my opinion is that so few of each party are willing to make first steps. That's why it's so important to ""clean your room"" first. If you show that you can change you have a much greater chance to inspire that very change in somebody/something else. And for those protesting for companies and politicians to change for the better of climate while not acting on that themselves: It's difficult. I think their support is badly needed to change the ""opposing party"", while I personally believe it's also a hugely immoral act. Don't expect something from somebody else that you're not willing to apply to yourself.",UCgXMlYo5hYuaZJA3uaWLm6Q,1,UgykWNA5TC9-ofjAwKB4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

I'm sure CEOs of oil and coal companies have their life in order, otherwise they wouldn't be so successful right? But that success comes at the cost of the environment which they knowingly ingore in favor of maximized personal gain, namely money I think the point being made was, that pysically alone those teens protesting climate change simply do not have the time to become prime minister in order to influence or reverse what is happening right now. but since they (or we) are the ones who will be most affected by this (contrary to the decisionmakers of today) it is necessary to protest because right now, at the time action is needed, that's the only thing we can do.

I’m in New Zealand so it’s quite a different situation here and for us and our Australian neighbours we’re protected from much of what occurs (hence my issue with this video and the issues affecting our generation from an Australasian perspective being relatively minor in the grand scheme of things). Our grandparents were objectively hit harder than us and so from that perspective, her comments in the video are a stretch. During the Spanish Flu pandemic, the USA and UK tried to keep information on the virus quiet in order to not upset the war propaganda. This current situation with the pandemic is the first time the globe has unilaterally cut access through the boarders and gone into lockdown, so it’s unfamiliar territory as far as the different economies go and each country is doing what they think is right to handle the situation. This video is obviously pre-covid but as far as disadvantaged go, all existing generations are involved with this one and the economic fallout hasn’t yet been felt - I can understand politicians in the USA trying to appeal to the stockmarket rather than to civilians in order to protect it from crashing. My country shut down almost immediately and reopened again after we had eliminated community transmissions of covid, otherwise keeping the boarders restricted and placing all arrivals into government funded isolation facilities. We had financial relief for businesses during lockdown which have since expired and so expect the fallout of lockdown to be felt in these next couple of months. So the situation is different everywhere and we can’t apply a ‘one glove fits all’ mentality to claims of generational disadvantage - certainly there are some that are disadvantaged and others that are advantaged over previous generations dependent on where in the world they live.

This doesn't change how correct he was and the reaction from people shows that clearly. Come up with a logical argument why having yourself in order before trying to change the world is not a logical statement.. Its really quite simple. Its why young people shouldn't be out there pushing agenda when they still don't even know who they are. As a 20 year old I thought I had everything worked out. As a 30 year old I realize I didn't then and I don't now. That's why I tend to lean towards evidence over how I feel about things.

He's been dealing with a wife who's diagnosed with terminal cancer, a daughter who almost died several times because of heavy mental and physical problems, suicidal family members, and now he's dealing with his own severe problems. And you think that it's okay to call him a hypocrite, because he's a human being who's been dealing with all of these issues? Would you have doen any better?

You're also seeing it as if he's saying we put all our problems on pause while we wait for people to work on cleaning their rooms before someone can solve something. Not the case. While young people focus on becoming better equipped to provide solutions and improving their skill sets, the people who already are capable work on solving problems. Problem solving doesn't get put on hold, seeing as that is how you've sadly interpreted JP by your little treaty issue and the hypothetical delay.

I understand the idea that advancing individuals will advance the collective, but its a fallacy of composition.

Because if you want to advance hundreds of million people first, before addressing an issue you are waiting DECADES before anything gets done. Malicious gossip might have it that thats the goal.

It also tells us she doesn't even understand what was meant by individual growth as she references assets which isn't the point (I believe this is her being disingenuous. She used 'assets' as an easy out when the meaning of individual improvement is obvious to a 12 year old). Instead, what does she do? List problems that isn't within her immediste scope of influence while in the same sentence disregarding the things that are. This is a very clear takeaway and basic comprehension of the English language tells you that. Also, it is me that is making the absolutely fair and frankly obvious presumption that she is using these things as an excuse to avoid actually working on herself and would rather scream for change instead of being a part of it but less so JP. When he got to the crux of the question he still spoke generally and answered it the best way possible. You, like her, seem to not have understood his answer and so I'll paraphrase. The collective is comprised of individuals. Therefore, individual growth is necessary when aiming to create a healthy collective capable of change. He says, working on yourself, increasing your skillset and competencies, advancing in your careers and thereby becoming effective leaders in society leads to a collective FAR more capable of changing the world than the collective before each individual aimed to do this. This is a very simple concept. This is what he said to her and he spoke generally. I can make that assumption about her because anyone who can read her words accurately would draw the same interpretation. JP, on the other hand, wouldn't have made a remark at the end ""complain about societal issues to impress their friends"" or something if not for her rudeness in the beginning. It seems to me you either hate the guy or are a pseudo intellectual who thinks he has reasonable critiques where he doesn't.

Not seeing what was wrong in his answer. You also take issue with their being impressed by JP? Your judgement that followed is quite pretentious and devoid of the consideration that there are multiple things to be impressed at, like the calmness in his response, not allowing himself to get angry while also not ignoring an insult. He simply said he's impressed by how he handles situations, and he certainly has a good way of handling them, something a lot of people (even those who disagree with things he says) will agree with.",UC_zAziAhBVkvjH1DOwgUb5g,1,UgxcN5RhDOGIpP9IThZ4AaABAg,qTk-69f64KU,2019-02-27 06:09:48

Climate change, besides the ""that depends on what you mean by Jesus""-meme, is maybe the very weakest point of Peterson. When he is nailed down to facts he basically ends up parroting pseudo-arguments from science deniers.
