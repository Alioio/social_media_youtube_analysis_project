Humans could not release enough CO2, even if we tried, to have an impact on global temperature. The Pacific Ocean on the other hand, plays a role, along with variations in the Earth&#39;s elliptical orbit around the Sun, and Sun surface activity, among many other factors that real climatologists study, unlike the alarmist scientist, many of whom were not necessarily climatologists when they began to receive grants to study the completely fabricated crisis of human-induced &quot;global warming&quot; or &quot;climate change&quot;. When a scientists entire budget, career, and livelihood is provided by the very foundations and unimaginable wealthy families (Which attained that wealth by largely unethical, and many times criminal activity, exploiting, extracting, and selling the oil from the Earth. Oil that belongs to EVERY human being alive on the planet, as it took millions of years to form. ), what is the most likely conclusion that they will arrive at? One that is truthful, logical, objective and unbiased? Or the one that continues their funding, keeps them in the spotlight, and satisfies the very wealthy, powerful entities I just mentioned. This manufactured, (by the hand of man), fabrication (something invented), began as an offensive tactic by big oil to take down big coal, but they soon realized the other inherent possibilities of the agenda, including carbon taxes, controlling the capital influx (remember, they have all the real wealth already) to renewables and emerging technology in power generation (watch the documentary &quot;Newman&quot;), therefore gaining monopolistic, complete control over the rest of us.

Scientists also forget or omit the fact that released Co2 enables forests and all plant life on earth to thrive and flourish bringing about massive and rapid reforestation that has its own positive effect of fauna enabling it to also grow and flourish. Oh how this little FACT is overlooked and even hidden, if Scientists admitted this openly all climate change, green energy policies would fail overnight.

No one believes in climate change more than me for we all have seen climate change from the three major Ice-ages recorded in history to the subsequent warming periods (which were the Medieval warming period in the Roman warming period). However, Anthropogenic global warming is a complete hoax. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has nothing to do with creating global warming. CO2 Is currently 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 produced in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible and yet we are told it is true. Lastly, carbon dioxide will increase only after temperatures rise and conversely CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack there of and therefore does not drive climate but follows climate.",UClj5S7b1CP1_QpXGtAz3AQA,0,Ugw690_N67yycpEJvnl4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Universities are a shame, not just the students, who maybe can be easily fooled. PhD professors and PhD researchers claiming that we all shoud go vegans because cow farts produce Global Warming and many other nonsense. Are they idiots? Even NASA and NOOA are a real huge shame.<br /><br />BIG ICE AGE<br />The easiest and simplest, understandable way you can explain the BIG ICE AGE to your family, friends and to everyone you find on your way and that does not require any science background, not even basic science, is the following: <br /><br />Man-made-global-warming is nonsense. CO2 is not a pollutant. CO2 is food for plants, food for life, food for happiness. CO2 is really good for every living thing on Earth.<br /><br />The Sun manages the Earth’s climate. The Sun creates the Earth’s climate. <br /><br />As we know, the Sun has a cycle of 11 years on average and as its activity increases, so does the number of spots on its surface. The action of the Sun reaches the entire Solar System. It reaches the Earth, which is mainly oceans. There in the oceans, the Earth’s climate will finish cooking. <br /><br />But the Earth has the Moon, so the action of the Sun that reaches the Earth is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon.<br /><br />The Moon has several cycles, of which, for now, we are interested in two of them.<br />The synodic cycle, from New Moon to New Moon and the metonic cycle. <br /><br />This metonic cycle is named after Meton, a very wise guy who lived in Greece 500 years before Christ. He realized that 235 lunations, i.e., 235 synodic cycles, were equivalent to 19 years, with an accuracy of less than two and a half hours. Very wise Meton.<br /><br />This means that if on July 16, 2019 there is Full Moon, then in the year 2000 (19 years before), as well as in the year 2038 (19 years later), there is also Full Moon on July 16.<br /><br />Then we have a solar cycle of 11 years and we have a lunar cycle of 19 years. If we multiply 11x19, we now have a cycle of 209 years composed of the action of the Sun and the way in which this action is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon. <br /> <br />At the peak of each eleven year solar cycle, its magnetic poles will exchange places. The north magnetic pole goes to the South and the south magnetic pole goes to the North. So, the complete solar cycle is actually 22 years.<br /><br />And, then again: 22x19=418. Two hundred years ago, the Dalton Minimum occurred and four hundred years ago the Maunder Minimum, the Little Ice Age, occurred. As they say, we have these two trains arriving at the same time. <br /><br />Let&#39;s talk a little about History. We currently use the Gregorian Calendar, a true masterpiece. It has an error of one day every 3,333 years. The Mayans had a slightly more precise calendar, an error of one day every 5,000 years.<br />We all understand the Gregorian Calendar. Anyone can say how many days will it take for his next birthday or for Christmas. The Mayan Calendar was understood only by priests.<br /><br />The Mayans recorded important astronomical, political and social events on stone columns or Stelae and on the upper part of the Stela, they recorded the date of the Long Count in which the event had taken place. The Long Count was a downward count and would have started 3,114 years before Christ, time in which, according to historians, there were no Mayans. <br /><br />A very clever english guy named Thompson, based solely on Stelae that recorded astronomical events, found the correlation between the Long Count and the Gregorian Calendar. The end of the Long Count indicated the death of the Fifth Sun. <br /><br />The Fifth Sun is the one we see every day flying high in the sky. The Long Count ended on December 21, 2012.<br /><br />John Casey very accurately, almost exactly, said that the current “solar hibernation” had begun at the beginning of the year 2013.<br /> <br />The Mayans were dedicated to study Astronomy several centuries. Because of the rudimentary nature of their methods, it is very difficult that they could reach the knowledge of the Long Count with complete accuracy. I think this is a much older knowledge that the Mayans received and preserved. <br /><br />Of all the Grand Solar Minima that have occurred in the last millennia, none is comparable to the current one. This one will be very much worse and very much longer. it will last hundreds of years. Maybe, thousands of years.<br /><br />We will not enter in the future in a regular Grand Solar Minimun or in a Mini Ice Age. Since December 21, 2012 we are in the biggest Grand Solar Minimun ever. A real an long lasting BIG ICE AGE.<br /><br />Valentina Zharkova, that brilliant and lovely lady, said last year that next Solar Cycle 25 will be very weak and will last only eight years. This Cycle 25 will begin later this year or early 2020. In her recently published paper she says: “Substantial temperature decrease are expected during the grand minima ... whose magnitude can not be yet predicted”.<br /><br />Now NASA says that Cycle 25 will be “the weakest of the past 200 years”. Yeah, finally they noticed. Good boys. It will begin in April 2020 and will last 11 years. That is OK, but NASA has been cheating everyone and playing games with the man-made-global-warming nonsense, for too many years. <br /><br />So, at the beginning of year 2024, the Solar Cycle 25 will be at it&#39;s weak peak. From now, until 2024, the climate chaos will be growing faster and faster. After that, we will be in a free fall, going deeper into the BIG ICE AGE.<br /><br />I want to analyze the effects of the other Moon cycles. The anomalistic cycle, from apogee to apogee, wich precesses and makes a complete round in 08.75 years and the draconic cycle, that involves the ascending and descending lunar nodes, which precesses and takes 18.60 years to make a complete round. <br /><br />More at: <a href=""http://manuelesbri.com/"">manuelesbri.com</a>",UCZM34jVSbunBJ1V4X6VfwvA,0,UgwUIGRBhWncdQC6msl4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

I maintain the hoax temp records are constantly being adjusted to show an increase and satellite (that needs no &quot;correction&quot;) is not shown. The recent cooling is likely due to the the recent ebbing of the solar cycle - grand solar minimum maybe here and temperatures will cool for the next 200 years.

Therefore CO2 is not the thermostat that controls our climate on this planet. Carbon dioxide is completely ineffective at driving Climate. <br /><br />History even records climate change... we all have seen climate change from <br />the three major Ice-ages recorded in history to the subsequent warming <br />periods (which were the Medieval warming period in the Roman warming period). <br /><br />However, Anthropogenic global warming is a complete hoax.

CO2 Is currently 400 ppm. <br />That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. <br />Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 produced in a year. <br /><br />CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible and yet we are told it is true.

Put on your thinking caps. The planet is a big place so the hottest summer where. Where do the reporters capture temp info so quickly given the size of the planet-think about it. There are 200 countries of different sizes. There are tons of islands that are part of countries. Are they taking 1 temp. station per country. There is the ocean &amp; the ocean at depth. There is temp at sea level &amp; then there is temp. at elevation or depth in a canyon &amp; different biome. Are they taking only city temps? See you don&#39;t have a very good model to make any conclusion. To improve such models would require lots of thermometers spaced out at every certain # of yards. That&#39;s a lot of data that has to be reported &amp; recorded. So traditionally after summer closes, the reporters instantly report how hot it was. Now you can&#39;t just readily open up NOAA books-this would take research even if they were using a gazillion stations. The reporters are misleading the public-where is it hottest. What is the methodology? Ok in some summers at some latitude this state has say X days of 90 degree days while in a previous summer it was X - 5. How is this relevant. There is no invisible wizardry at work. I&#39;ve seen 90 degree days as a kid; I see 90 degrees now. Nothing different. See the failed projection was that this amount of carbon was to really make temp skyrocket aka the 90 degree days would zoom up to 150 or so &amp; then panic would set.

Other types of islands don't have this protective mechanism and are facing an ever-increasing threat from rising seas. Some islands have already lost their freshwater sources from salt water overwashes during storm surges. These islands must have fresh water shipped in from elsewhere. The protective shore rebuilding doesn't exist among the thousands of cities and towns that line the world's shores. High tide flooding, in fact, has increased 140% along the American northeast in just 20 years, according to NOAA. It's up 190% along the southeast. In the 20th century, sea level rise averaged 1.5mm per year. In the 1990s it jumped to 3mm per year. From 2013-2018 it jumped to 5mm per year. And 2019? 6mm per year. It's the reason Miami Beach has already spent half a billion dollars on elevating seawalls, moving buildings and raising 105 miles of roads and why New York has a new $10 billion flood mitigation project in the works. This really isn't in someone's imagination. NASA and European satellite altimeter data and worldwide tide gauges agree on the numbers. When two methodologies agree, we probably ought to take that pretty seriously. By the way, the factor that initiates ice ages are Milankovitch Cycles, changes in Earth's orbit, axial tilt and precession. All three cycles are in COOLING phases now, not warming ones. In fact, we entered a slight cooling phase over 2000 years ago, when earth's tilt decreased from 24 degrees to 23.4. That cooling continued right up until the industrial Revolution, which reversed the trend. Nature intended to move us out of our present interglacial and into another ice age in several thousand years.

""Climate change"" includes `warming and all of the side effects of that warming, including changes in the jet stream and other wind currents,, an increase in extreme precipitation events and drought, migration of the snow/rain line toward the poles, an intensification of hurricanes, and more. ""Al Gore was spreading this crap 20 years ago."" Yes, and he was right, Kennedy. Let's look at what he predicted: INCREASED WARMING: 19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record. 2020 is tied with 2016 for the warmest ever. Record warm temperatures are now outpacing record cold ones by a 1.7 to 1 margin. https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/ SCORE: Al Gore HEAT CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE POLES: Average winter temperature for Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska has risen an astonishing 8 degrees F since mid 20th century.

The northeast is up 140%. SCORE: Al Gore EXTREME PRECIPITATION WILL INCREASE: The first quarter of 2019 was the wettest in U.S. history. Extreme downpours have risen 55% in the northeast since 1960, according to the EPA. They've risen 30-40% in the south, midwest and northern states. Similar increases in extreme precipitation are being seen around the world. SCORE: Al Gore. HURRICANES WILL INCREASE: They actually haven’t increased but they have strengthened. Since 1995 there have been 17 above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, as measured by NOAA’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index. ACE calculates the intensity of a hurricane season by combining the number, wind speed and duration of each tropical cyclone. That’s the largest stretch of above-normal seasons on record.

A quick history lesson: COOLING SCARE OF 70S The global cooling scare of the 70s arose from a handful of scientists (not the majority, who were in fact warning about global warming even then) who worried about our ever-growing sulfate aerosol pollution problem. Sulfate aerosols, produced from burning coal, reflect sunlight and cool the planet the same way aerosols from volcanoes do. We were, in fact, in the middle of a slight cooling trend then, so the concern had some merit. Because aerosols were also causing premature deaths and massive health and lung problems worldwide, the U.S. decided to do something and passed the Clean Air Act (1970), which significantly reduced sulfate aerosol pollution. The clean-up was so effective that climate scientists can actually mark the time period of the 70s by the absence of the aerosol pollutants in ice cores. The long-lasting result was over $22 trillion in savings in health care, according to the EPA. Unfortunately, the drop in aerosols left C02 as the dominant pollutant, allowing it to continue to trap heat and raise global temperatures, just as MOST scientists in the 70s warned that it would. https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/89/9/1325/59455/THE-MYTH-OF-THE-1970s-GLOBAL-COOLING-SCIENTIFIC https://skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s-intermediate.htm We eliminated the acid rain threat when we beefed up the Clean Air Act several years later and required industry to place scrubbers on their smokestacks to prevent acid rain from forming in the atmosphere. It didn't disappear on its own. Also, no scientist ever said we'd all die from acid rain. Scientists began warning of global warming long before the 1990s. The first evidence for it was announced by scientists in 1938. And by the way, nearly ALL of the predictions made by climate scientists have come true. 19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record. 2020 is tied for first as the warmest year of all. Record warm teperatures are now outpacing record cold ones by a 1.7 to 1 margin. The oceans are the warmest ever recorded. The Arctic, Greenland, Antarctica and almost all of the world's glaciers are melting at record pace. Sea level rise has increased from 1.5mm throughout most of the 20th century to 5mm per year from 2013-2018. In 2019 it reached 6mm per year, according to the World Meteorological Organization. High tide flooding along the AMerican northeast has increased 140% in just 20 years, according to NOAA. It's up 190% along the southeast. It's why Miami Beach has raised 105 miles of roads and elevated seawalls and why New York has a new $10 billion flood mitigation project in the works. Category 1 and 2 hurricanes are decreasing while category 4 and 5 storms are increasing. Extreme precipitation events over the American northeast have increased over 50% since 1960, according to EPA statistics. They have increased 30-40% over the south, midwest and northern plains. Four 500-year rainfalls in Houston in four years is not normal. These same increases are being seen around the world.

With anything in science their is uncertainty. However <95% of Climatologist agree that more than 95% of the warming observed since 1950 has been of a result of humans increasing the levels of greenhouse gases like CO2 in the air. The last 6 years were the 6 hottest on record (2016, 2019, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2014) Earth has warmed about 1.1°C or 2°F since 1880, most of that warming talking place since 1980. That warming is taking place 5x faster than natural. A typical ice age recovery would take 5,000-10,000 years to warm 5°C. Earth could be warming at a rate of 20x faster by 2100. Current CO2 levels are at 415 ppmv. For 800,000 years, ice cores show CO2 remaining between 180 ppmv and 280 ppmv. This kept Earth in an ice age for 2 million years. Current CO2 is the highest in 5 million years. Physics tells us the more CO2 and other greenhouse gases are put into the air like CH4, H2O, N2O, and O3, the planet will get warmer. This greenhouse has been on Earth for Billions of years and while other things like Milankovitch Cycles and Solar Output can effect Earth’s climate. Earth’s climate will always be determined by the composition of Earth’s atmosphere. While other natural forces can affect Earth’s climate, none are large enough to affect Earth’s Climate as much as humanity. What are the effects of a warmer world?Like anything is science, there is uncertainty. However there is somethings that are known. The Earth will likely warm 4°C to 5°C by 2100 and more than 8°C by 2200. The last time Earth was that hot was during the PETM 55 million years ago. A potential hot house Earth could be coming as humans have delayed an already over due ice age by 100,000+ years. CO2 levels could reach 900+ ppmv by 2100 the highest in 55 million years. The IPCC outlined the result of a 1.5°C and 2°C warming by 2100. And needs to be prevented by cutting emissions by 2030 according to the 2015 Paris Agreement. A warmer world would melt the ice cape, Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of tons of ice per year. Even though it would take thousands of years to melt all of Earth ice even if hothouse conditions are met by 2100, but not all ice melt is needed to see problems. Melting ice would cause sea levels to rise, likely 0.5-2 meters (2-6 ft) by 2100, sea levels are rising at 3 mm a year and could be 10 mm a year by 2100. This would flood major costal cities and displacing millions. More than 90% of the heat created by climate change is going into the oceans. This is breaking heat records for ocean heat content each year. Not only are warmer oceans causing higher ocean acidification and destroying marine life. But warmer oceans evaporators more moisture. For every 1°F warming in the air, the atmosphere can hold 5% more water. This means more heavy rain and snow events. Warmer oceans can be energy more less frequent, but stronger hurricanes. A warmer arctic could slow the jet stream and cause more extreme weather. Like more droughts and floods. A slower jet stream could also lead to more extreme cold events all though in a warmer future, heat will likely beat cold. Extreme Heat waves will get worst, wildfires will be more likely to occur. However despite these some extreme weather events like Tornadoes will likely become less frequent. And when talking about Climate Change. There can be positives. Like more room to yield better crops. Although extreme changes in climate can mess up this processes. And when talking about human induced global warming. We have to talk about climate feedbacks like warmer oceans and melting glaciers could release more greenhouse gases. Climate Change won’t end the world, but extreme weather will be happening more.",UCNrXngTy7SQf0tDWQ88qefQ,1,Ugw1_JFT7IU1d-mQE8F4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

This is thru particle acceleration from our sun on the Earths weakening magnetic field. The magnetic field itself shifts after 10s of thousands of years (can’t remember exact amount). Causes the sun to act up every so often (in cosmic terms) and now we know our own star has “Carrington events” (1859? Solar flare) every so often.

In those cases temperature increases due to other factors (mainly change I orbital forcing due to changes in the earth tilt) and then the increase in temperature leads to a degasing of co2 out of the oceans which lead to more temperature rise...

I tend to be open minded and judge from both sides. Apparently, why do I find the ""skeptic"" side more reasonable and more convincing? Of course I'm still trying to figure out which side I'm suppose to be on. Also, I suppose you're familiar with the scientific method. It is to come up with a hypothesis on a question. However, how exactly do you prove your hypothesis? It is not to come up with evidence that supports the hypothesis, but rather to come up with evidence that debunks and proves the hypothesis wrong. It would be left as a theory of some sort. If it were the other around, then that would be considered as ""pseudo science"". So the science and debate of all this ongoing climate change action is not settled. Oh, and btw, the evidence for my argument of ""co2 doesn't cause temperature increase"" is from the below videos I've watched (Also, all the climate skeptics' arguments proved).

The issue lies not with whether that happens, but rather the fact that, in very simple terms so you can actually comprehend me, trap heat...I have no idea what's your point here b)CO2 is indeed lighter than thee air and therefore concentrates at the ground level, but why are you suggesting that because it's at ground level, the greenhouse effect is non-existent? The most basic concept of greenhouse effect is that greenhouse gases have to capture heat *from near the earth's surface* . If you had at least half a brain, you'd realise this means having greenhouse gases at ground level is a prerequisite for greenhouse effect to occur. This isn't even a misunderstanding of the science this is a severe lack of common sense on your part. c)Assuming that your data is actually credible, 50ppm should be a good eighth, or 0.125% of 400ppm. Greaaaat, now you even made a simple mathematical miscalculation that even a primary schooler wouldn't make. Hat's off to you I believe there's no need to go d) to humiliate you further.

Gases mix perfectly with other Gases b) given enough time, gases will mix (almost) perfectly. To visualize this, you can use miscible liquids which behave similarly. Take a drop of coloured sugar water (syrup)and layer it under a glass of water. Eventually it will mix evenly because of diffusion, turbulence (like stirring in the glass or winds in the athmosphere) will accelerate the process.c) where you you getting this from? the preindustrial background is generally given as 280ppm. so we now have an approximately 33% contribution to the atmospheric CO2. Besides that, those 0.04% of CO2 are a substantial part of the reason why earth is nowhere near the 257 K temperature we would expect it to have based on radiative heating and cooling alone. d) the biosphere is solid, organic carbon, not CO2. That means if we BURNED EVERY LIVING THING, including algae and bacteria, the atmospheric concentration of carbon would increase about sixtyfold.

It states that we hit a spot close to the sun that will cause 300 years of increased global warming for our planet. Well I&#39;m here to comment and say that the sun is not the only cause of global warming. People want to blame something else for there problems instead of looking at the reality. The sun may have a part in global warming but all the blame can not be thrown at the sun because we release green-house gasses into the atmosphere every single day. We are also heating this planet up and there is plenty of proof of it. Not to mention all of the wars countries had back in the day did speed this situation up. Wars, coal mining, burning coal &amp; gasoline fuels, most of our electricity runs off burning coal for fuel, Forrest/brush fires, we killed almost all the blue whales off (which help capture CO2 in the atmosphere, which they would have helped drag the green house gas to the bottom of the ocean,) and we chopped down all of our forest. Trees also helped clean the air of CO2 and released oxygen for us to breathe. It also doesnt help that the oceanic conveyor belt has slowed down by 22% which helps keep the earths temperatures steady around the world. There are plenty of people and animals on earth which also help make the planet warmer due to body temperature and over crowding. We can&#39;t blame all of global warming on the sun. If it wasn&#39;t for the sun, we would not be here on earth living to observe this wonderful planet along with our beautiful universe we live in.

And if you are that good at understanding the greenhouse effect, you would happen to know that it is not linear. So to increases the temperature with another half degree you need to pretty much double the CO2 amount for the first half degree.Then double it again and again. So 2 degree increase will literally require to more than double the current amount of CO2 as a whole. If CO2 was this dangerous how is it the planet was about the same with 20 times the current amount in the atmosphere in the past?

Here are all the predictions Al Gore got right: (SOURCES: NOAA NASA, World Meteorological Org., the Japanese Meteorological Agency, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, EPA) TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO RISE:  20 of the last 22 years were the hottest in recorded history. So were the last ten. So was the summer of 2019. So was September.   The oceans are the hottest in recorded history.  The temperature rise of 5-7 degrees in Alaska, northern Canada and the Arctic is unprecedented in recorded history. The average winter temperature rise of 9.8 degrees F in Barrow, Alaska and 8.1 degrees F in Fairbanks since 1949 is off the charts. The 2018 global heatwave spanning seventeen countries was the most extensive heat event in recorded history.  Record hot temperatures are now outpacing record cold temperatures by a 2 to 1 margin, unprecedented in recorded history. THE ICE SHEETS WILL CONTINUE TO MELT:  95% of the Arctic's oldest, thickest ice is now gone. It is GONE. What’s left is a thinning veneer, and that, too, is continuing to lose mass. See NASA TIME LAPSE VIDEO OF ARCTIC ICE and see for yourself.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHE0n5c6-6g Greenland and Antarctica are also melting at unprecedented rates. In 1979, Antarctica was losing an average of 40 gigatons of ice per year. As of 2017, it was losing over 250 gigatons per year. https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/antarctica-losing-six-times-more-ice-mass-annually-now-than-40-years-ago/ Greenland has lost enough ice in the last two decades to drown Australia in knee-deep water. http://nsidc.org/greenland-today/ SEA LEVEL WILL CONTINUE TO RISE:  Sea level rise is accelerating, according to the latest announcement by the World Meteorological Organization, and now stands at an average of 5mm mm per year, up from 4 mm just six years ago and 3.2 mm in the 1990s. https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/global-climate-2015-2019-climate-change-accelerates It's the reason Miami is spending half a billion dollars to move buildings and raise streets and why New York has a $10 billion flood mitigation project in the works. HIGH TIDE FLOODING WILL INCREASE: According to NOAA, high tide flooding along the American southeast coast has risen 190% in 30 years. It’s up 140% along the northeast. It’s why Miami is rising streets and seawalls and why New York now has a $10 billion flood mitigation project in the works. HEAVY RAINSTORMS WILL INCREASE: According to NOAA and the Fourth National Climate Assessment, since 1958, epic, flooding rainstorms have increased 55% in the northeast, 42% in the midwest, 29% in the northern great plains, and 27% in the south. In the spring of 2018, Nebraska farmers lost $440 million in cattle, due to drowning. In 2019 Queensland, Australia lost 500,000 cattle to drowning. Houston, Texas has suffered four 500-year rains in three years. New Zealand recently survived three feet of rain in 48 hours. Part of Maryland has suffered two 1000-year rainfalls in two years. The first quarter of 2019 was the wettest on record for the U.S. We’ve always had flooding, of course.

Like water, too much of a good thing is too much of a good thing. Numerous unversity studies show that higher C02 diminishes staple crops like rice and wheat of their zinc, iron and protein content. Some plants lose part of their natural defenses against insects, which devour them. Other plants lose folate. It's not as simple as it appears or as the fossil fuel industry would have you believe with their ""C02 is good for plants"" marketing blitz. C02 added in a greenhouse bears no relation to C02 added in the outside world.    In the outside world, C02-driven warming accelerates evaporation, which fills the air with additional water vapor which, according to EPA statistics, is increasingly falling as extreme precipitation events. Extreme precipitation washes away topsoils and fertilizer and decimates plants. Just ask the midwest farmers last spring who lost half of their growing season to just such an event. Or the Queensland, Australia farmers who lost 500,000 cattle to drowning, or the Nebraska farmers who lost $440 million in cattle last year. Houston has suffered four 500-year rainfalls in four years. Part of Maryland has suffered two 1000-year rainfalls in two years. New Zealand recently survived three feet of rain in 48 hours.    We've always had flooding, of course. But these events are markers for a trend that has been growing since 1958, according to the EPA. The first quarter of 2019 was the wettest in U.S. history. According to NOAA, extreme preciptation events are up 55% in the northeast and 30-40% in the midwest and south.   Paradoxically, in drier parts of the world, where rain clouds seldom pass, accelerated evaporation does just the opposite. It sucks moisture out of the ground and vegetation and increases desertification, drought and wildfires. It's precisely why Australia is burning down to cinders as we speak.    Finally, C02-driven warming melts the icecaps, and I've already posted the consequences of that. The latest data is showing that the benefits of C02 on the planet were left behind about 20 years ago. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-stopped-getting-greener-20-years-ago/",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1,UgwxS89x5-Z6fEvbo2B4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

High tide flooding along the U.S. southeastern coast has risen 190% in just 20 years, according to NOAA. It's up 140% along the northeast. According to the World Meteorlogical Organization, current average global sea level rise is 5mm per year, up from 4mm just six years ago and 3mm in the 1990s. Throughout most of the 20th century it hovered around 1.5 mm. It is accelerating. Calculating the present acceleration forward, we can expect a two-to-three-foot rise by 2100, at an annual projected cost of $14 trillion, according to a recent study in Environmental Research Letters. According to FEMA, it takes just one inch of flooding in the average home to cause $25000 in damage. Now multiply that by the millions of homes and businesses and hundreds of cities that line the world's shores. Over 2 million homes in the U.S. are located along the shores below four feet above sea level. That's a lot of houses to move. Who pays? And that's to say nothing of all of our infrastructure located along the shores. Military bases. (Like Norfolk). Massive petroleum processing facilities around New Orleans and Houston. Factories. Roads, highways, railways, power lines, wastewater treatment plants, and businesses large and small. Each year's new addition to sea level provides king tides and storm surges higher platforms to launch from. Sandy was a lowly category one hurricane when its 9-foot storm surge struck New York and caused $19 billion in flooding damage. Parts of the subway remain to be fixed. New York isn't waiting for the next one, which is why they have a new $10 billion flood mitigation project in the works..",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1,UgwxS89x5-Z6fEvbo2B4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The added heat melts the icecaps and permafrost, which in turn release C02 and methane. The Milankovitch-driven warming leads temperature for the first few hundred years, but its the greenhouse gases that kick warming into second and third gears and go on TO LEAD TEMPERATURE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, through over 90% of every major warming period. Modern warming, however, has nothing to do with either tectonic upheaval or Milankovitch Cycles. All three Milankovitch Cycles are in phases favoring cooling now, not warming.

This is because CO2, like ozone, N2O, CH4, and chlorofluorocarbons, does not condense and precipitate from the atmosphere at current climate temperatures, whereas water vapor can, and does. Non-condensing greenhouse gases, which account for 25% of the total terrestrial greenhouse effect, thus serve to provide the stable temperature structure that sustains the current levels of atmospheric water vapor and clouds via feedback processes that account for the remaining 75% of the greenhouse effect.

However, a &quot;no or not sure&quot; is an indicator that massive expenditures or lifestyle changes are not warranted.<br />1.    Is the world warming? Between 1998-2015 there was an 18-year pause in rising temperatures. Some climatologists think a new ice age is more likely to occur.  We are living at the very tail-end of an ~11,000-year warmer inter-glacial period.  Massive glaciation is the norm for the earth.<br />2.    Does climate change pose a threat to the planet? Seas are rising ~2mm/year, about 7-9 inches per century. Temperatures increased about 0.7C since 1850. A doubling of CO2 from 400ppm to 800ppm would only lead to another 0.7C increase. How does this make life, as we know it, end in the next 12 years, as some politicians claim?<br />3.    Is climate change being caused by humans? Or is it all part of evolving world cycles, e.g., solar activity? Earth has been much hotter and much cooler. CO2 levels have varied from 180ppm to almost 7,000ppm (last 140M years). The great civilizations flourished in times warmer than today. Greenhouses regularly operate at 1,200ppm. Plants thrive in higher concentrations of CO2; crop yields increase. The earth has been visibly greening the last 30 years!<br />4.    Are there practical things we can do? If we go back to an 18th-century lifestyle, the impact on temperature would be minimal — would all trees be cut down just to stay warm? What exactly is “The Plan” — is there a sensible one? Is it achievable? <br />5.    Are they affordable? Who pays for all this climate change remediation? The U.S. is already $22 trillion in debt. How do we balance this with demands for increases in social programs?<br />6.    Do we have the political will? Are citizens of the world willing to allow our leaders to implement changes that could directly affect our freedoms, pocketbooks, and consumption patterns? Do we need a one-world-government to have the power and authority to enforce the rules? Now, that would be a &quot;real change&quot; worth noting.",UCy_GuhcHOVOF7SGyKR0UHAg,0,UgwmuaMMm2chnHfuiM54AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

What some climatologists suposedly think (who are they?), against the vast, vast, vast majority of climate scientists, is perhaps interesting, but focusing on very small minorites would mean we could reject all your other points as relevant focus areas. 2. Temperatures have increased >1 degrees, with much less than a doubling. So, what would make you think another doubling would only add 0.7 degrees? 3. These are all poorly substantiated points, also ignoring various factors. CO2 concentrations have e.g., not been 7000 ppm in the last 140 M years. Greenhouses do not just optimize CO2 concentrations (and few at 1200 ppm - for many crops it is way too expensive for the little gain), in nature you'd have a change in the ecosystem because some plants will outcompete others because of more CO2, and ""the great civilizations"" were very localized and many of them are currently in regions where temperatures are higher than they were today. And that greening....could well have already turned into browning: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaax1396 4. Plenty! Much of it has little to do with going to an 18th century lifestyle. There are plans, plenty of plans, which are achievable and sensible...unless you are one of the losers. Like Australia losing billions because it can no longer sell its coal. Or Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela not being able to make much money from all their oil. Or lots of very, very, very large companies like Exxon, Shell, BP losing a lot of their income (and hence so will their investors). 5. Affordable? Sure. If a country can spend 600+ billion on the military, it can easily spend a few billion, or even tens of a billion, on energy transformation. 6. This may well become a self-fulfilling prophecy if we and politicians do not show courage: at some point it may become *necessary* to take very authoritarian measures to tackle the problems.",UCOfb6mABEdzdbt6oVv9gwJQ,1,UgwmuaMMm2chnHfuiM54AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Of course the alarmists already predicted that the coasts would be under water by now. Hard to believe these people when they are WRONG every single time. 10 more years until we are doomed!!! Apparently not. Fluorocarbons and the ozone layer, acid rain, CO2, methane, etc. It’s always something they are trying to terrify children about. It’s actually very cruel.

Regarding the logarithmic relationship (which anyone who reads up on this topic would have known): the temperature increase is correlated to the logarithm of the co2 increase, hence the ECS being defined per doubling. It's similar to the law of diminishing returns. Add the Planck feedback, and the runaway you believe will happen is unlikely to happen. With regard to the CO2 coming from the ocean: TIC (that would be total inorganic carbon) of the oceans is increasing, which already contradicts the oceans as a source. Moreover, it does not fit the simple fact that atmospheric CO2 increases slower than anthropogenic emissions combined with the limited sink capability of flora and fauna, the change in 12C/13C isotope ratio, and the marked drop in atmospheric oxygen concentrations (just try to explain why upon a rise in tempetature the oceans would only outgas CO2 and not oxygen). Finally, the temperature increase of the oceans is too limited to explain the massive increase. It took more than 5 degrees to release 100 ppm in the past. Why would a degree (of only the top layer) lead to 135 ppm being released in the present. Literally everything contradicts the oceans being the source of the recent atmospheric increase in CO2!",UCOfb6mABEdzdbt6oVv9gwJQ,1,UgwHdyVB_Rn7ectSq9V4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Water in the air will condense or evaporate; in doing so it will release or absorb heat, respectively, complicating calculations of the lapse rate and atmospheric  stability. In general, as a parcel of air rises, the water vapor  in it condenses and heat is released. The rising air will therefore cool more slowly as it rises; the wet adiabatic lapse rate will in general be less negative than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. The wet adiabatic lapse rate has been observed to vary between −6.5°C/km and −3.5°C/km.<br />Water in the atmosphere affects air quality in other ways as well. Fogs form when moist air cools and the moisture condenses. Aerosols provide the condensation nucleic, so that fogs tend to occur more frequently in urban areas. Serious air pollution episodes are almost always accompanied by fog (remember that the roots of the word “smog” are “smoke” and “fog”) because the tiny water droplets fog participate in the conversion of SO3 to H2SO4.

One is the fact, that since 13,000 years ago, the climate has swung back and forth in a major way three times. First, when, at 13,00 years ago, the earth had been warming up generally since about 17,000 years ago. We simply don't know why it started to warm about that time, which began the general warming indicating a shift out of the ice age. it reversed again about 13,000 years ago, when suddenly an event occurred which halted the warming. Then gradually over the next 2000 years, the climate in the North continued to melt enough to create the MASSIVE flooding and resulting physical land formations all over Southern Canada, especially evidenced in SW Canada and in the NW United States. After that the climate in North America has been steadily warming, until about 300 AD, when a cooling trend affected much of that same area. By about 880 AD, the climate entered a much warmer period that lasted until about 1200 AD. At THIS time, the Northern regions started cooling quite a bit and this cooling period became known as the ""Little Ice Age'. There is an excellent book written by Brian Fagan, pub in 2000 describing detailed changes in the weather, (the book was called ""The Little Ice Age), mostly concerning Europe. He explains how the North Atlantic climate oscillations of high and low pressure systems over Iceland and off Portugal and west of the Gibralter area changed back and forth a few times, and he details the society affects resulting. These were recorded by private historians, Monastery records, public domain records, mainstream religious writings, literature and even the artwork during some of these times. There were variations of cycles in these periods from 500 AD onward in the larger cycles of sometimes 40 and sometimes only 20 years. For example in 1316, the UK and northern Franken and the Netherlands were inundated with a long two year plus period of almost continuous rain.. after 1320, the seasons varied wildly, for very short periods, for the next 45 years or so, which led to the great peasant uprising of 1367, I think it was, where the farmers had lost a great deal of their production and the people suffered greatly form great personal depravations. Anyway, the temperature cycles have been MANY of varying lengths during the last 1500 years with very little actual proof of EXACTLY why these trends happened. But, needless to repeat, the so-called ""hockey stick"" graph is VERY misleading and a poor reference tool. It simply is taking in to account a MUCH too short of a time period, (about the last 20 years) to form a reliable trend. In fact, it is seriously challenged. Please consider the Brian fagan book, you will enjoy hearing about the human history and will likely get some good perspective concerning the variations of climate the Earth has been subjected to for all sorts of different reasons, as well as for certain time periods that change occurred without any hint of understanding the causes for them.

And I have never and will never get my information from Politicians. And yes it is true that Ice cores and Tree rings are the most reliable sources for data that we have. I know about the ""little Ice age"" and that average temperatures world wide dropped by a degree at that time, yet this can be explained with the axis of the earth wobbeling around from time to time and the earth's orbit around the sun changing slightly, which can both influence the climate abruptly. Yet the problem is that we don't see any of these natural climate-influencers coinciding with the temperature rise we see nowadays, which ultimately leads to the logical assumption that our greenhouse gas emissions must have something to do with it. I can understand that in a lot of ways it's hard to understand all of these things, or rather that it's easy to missinterpret them. But I still can't understand where your statement that climate has always been changing this abruptly comes from because simple google research gives me plenty of scientific articles saying otherwise.",UCQHcAMHkUetNefkwtwxzIQQ,1,UgxpNAVqK-X5oYXWX1h4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Firstly, don't get your information from a politician. As far as the :hockey stick"" temperature chart, this baby is totally bogus. the Earth's temperatures vary by regions, often with some areas warmer at the same time other areas are cooler, so determining an average is difficult, to say the least. The Earth's ""average"" temperatures, if graphed, over say the last 15,000 years would be all over the place, with a profile of a varying wavy line, not a steady change from the past until now. The Earth has been much warmer than it is now and much cooler than it is now. Again, this average thing is hard to nail down. Ice cores and tree growth rings are the BEST records to use as accurate data. Also, the Earth was doing such cycles long before the industrial age of mankind. I have a book you should enjoy reading. It is ""The Little Ice Age"", written by Brian Fagan. He gives great information about the temperature and climate weather changes for roughly the last 1500 years. He uses public records, Monk's records, township records, personal diaries, etc, which cover historical and natural information. He delves deeply into how the weather has affected Europe, mostly, and it gives great insight how the populations of Europe were affected by severe weather changes, and how the changes were brought about. He discusses ocean currents, and weather patterns, and some wonderful human experiences about the trials of our early European ancestors because of them.

Planting trees where you want them to grow in this sense is no different than planting trees to harvest their apples and oranges or as with fir trees to harvest their timber and pulp products including paper. Planting trees as CO2 scrubbers or to garner ""carbon credits"" is simply another way the political class, particularly statists, con the gullible into surrendering power and wealth to them. Once ancient carbon is liberated from ancient sequestered sources through oxidation in the form of CO2, notably through the combustion of ""fossil"" fuels and the oft ignored production process of Portland cement it remains part of the biosphere for millions of years. Planting trees for fun or profit does nothing to avoid this simple fact The later CO2 source is usually ignored by the political class since it does nothing for their con game, but it remains the major source of CO2 production. In it, limestone (CaCO3 or calcium carbonate, ) is crushed, then heated to 2700 degrees in huge fossil fuel heated kilns to bake the CO2 out of the CaCO3 thus leaving only CaO or ""quicklime,"" the major ingredient in Portland cement. These kilns often have volumes equivalent to a large aircraft hangers and the massive amount of CO2 that is released is due both through the combustion of massive amounts of fossil fuels as a heat source as well as by the heat liberating even far more CO2 by driving the gas out of its calcium carbonate ore. The eventual re-sequestration of carbon sources occurs primarily in the oceans when the bones and shells of the sea creatures that assimilate most of the world's CO2, die off with their shells and bones (made mostly of CaCO3) falling to the sea bed to once again slowly reform to limestone and its more ancient cousin, marble. Thus the re-cycle is completed. That CO2 and H2O are the fundamental chemicals of all life forms on Earth is inarguable. More free CO2 simply means more life, and more healthy life forms in both the plant and animal kingdoms. The fact that CO2 remains so rare despite our best efforts to create far more of it owes to the fact that all life on Earth consumes it voraciously. That CO2 is dangerous to either short or long term weather (climate) fluctuations is a crazy hypothesis easily disproved by empirical evidence. CO2 levels have been 20 times what they are today with no discernible link to either short or long term climate cycles. The forces that produce these are all quite beyond human control *RE ""I'd really ask you to show me some sources here.""* I'd ask you in return to do your own homework and if you cannot find other sources for what I have told you, I'll help you out at that time.",UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA,1,Ugzv_1Zr5fXzeYfFbr94AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Also there are graphs showing the rise and fall of the mean temperature of the world and none of them was as fast as it is increasing right now, it just took around 50-100 years to make an increase of 1°C. So, what does this mean? That this was never seen by Earth, whilst our planet's climate has changed temperatures all the time, it was never at this rate, it is totally unseen. It is obvious that CO2 takes a big role on this. Why? Because it is a greenhouse gas, that means it has a big capacity of storing heat, which eventually (if it's produced in very high rates) will warm up the mean temperature of the globe. Why is it our fault? Because cars, coal power plants and factories produces it when burning fossil fuels, therefore increasing CO2 levels and making temperatures rise. How was it proven? Because in addition to this explanaition there is a positive correlation between the rise of polluting industries and rising CO2 levels and temperatures. The levels of this gas in the atmosphere have rise from about 315 parts per milliom (ppm) in 1950 to over 400 ppm in 2012, and its expected to reach 600 ppm by 2050. Hmmm, wonder what also rapidly risen? The quantity of cars and polluting industries in the world!

I can also take data and manipulate it to show what I want. Not using all data available is not science. Not producing something that is repeatable is not science. We are warming, does CO2 play a role, yes. Does it play as big of a role as what every doomsday person says? Absolutely not, which is evidence by history as a whole not little snippets that you like to quote. History says we have been in multiple ice ages with CO2 levels multiple times higher than we are currently seeing. We have also had high temperatures with lower levels of CO2. We have had Greenland go from lush green pasture great for colonizing (Erik the Great) and then four generations later it become an ice sheet with little change to CO2. But hey lets believe that CO2 is the all encompassing gas that controls everything when we have evidence that says otherwise. Could it be that maybe the belief that CO2 is the greatest cause of our climate is a little overblown? Could it be that everything is not known on how it is all interconnected? Could it be that we are seeing something that has not happened in the past? All yes. Stop pretending that everything is the end of the world, because it will end no matter what at some point.

You do know that vegetation cover and all that stuff somewhat reliefs the enhanced greenhouse effect but not completely eliminates it right? It doesn't matter how many trees we will plant, CO2 levels will rise either way if we continue this trend. This no alarmist issue, 97% of scientists agree with the enhanced greenhouse effect. You are right on something, though. The climate has been changing for years and climate change has always happened in all Earth's existentance. But, what is alarming is not that, it is the process of the enhanced greenhouse effect, i'm now quoting a book i have: ""The enhanced greenhouse effect is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activities. It is often referred to as global warming."" The greenhouse effect by itself doesn't do any harm, in fact, it creates the conditions for Earth to be inhabitable, but it's enhancement is what harms us. Melting glaciers, rising sea levels, droughts, changes of agricultural patterns, permafrost melting, fires and heat waves are some of the horrible effects of this process, which needs to be addressed as soon as possible. The rhetoric you are using is flawed, mainly because when the Industrial Revolution happened, just a few countries had this terribly polluting industries, therefore, making a very small impact. Now, as in 2019, every country in the world (except Bhutan) has polluting industries that affect our climate negatively. I don't know where you checked but there is very clear proof of what is happening, just check Mauna Loa station's temperature record the last 70 years and you'll see the dramatic rise of temperatures.",UCGA_JUTHCDmT0ZZdNjCIclg,1,Ugzvo68M2qeCe_cm6cl4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The orbiting cycles you reference cause glaciation. You notion of &#39;normal&#39; is based on only the last 150 years. Where does the Little Ice Age fit in? What about the Medieval Warm Period (yes, it was global). You imply our knowledge of pre-1860 climate was down to a few diary entries, while in fact we have substantial knowledge derived from ice cores and tree rings going back 7,000 years. In fact, what we see today is nothing unusual. You refer only to irradiance as a solar variable whereas - as you should know by know - solar magnetic activity plays a crucial role on varying cloud cover, which in turn changes the climate. Why did you stand in front of the chart at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hphdsLcSTYQ&amp;t=0m30s"">0:30</a> and so partially obscure the decline in global temperature between 1940 and 1970? Didn&#39;t you want us to see how for 30 years global temperatures declined while CO2 output increased? Why did you not mention that known variation in sunspot cycle-length indicating solar magnetic variance almost perfectly matches that decline and subsequent rise? And when you speak of &#39;scientists&#39; understanding climate (which they don&#39;t - they just study it and draw hypotheses), why did you not point out that some of the best-informed scientists do not agree with the CO2 hypothesis?

Have you worked in an environment in which an evidenced based practice was necessary to make decisions? Well, I have to the second question and thus have some appreciation for the research that climate scientists do in making predictions. I haven't worked in that field, but have studied science for decades. In the same way that researchers in other fields make projections about the development of disease transmission for example I wouldn't hazard a guess to say whether those highly trained individuals have enough evidence to make predictions. By the same token climate scientists are generally Phd scientists and have considerable training to get where they are so I don't presume to claim that THEY don't have enough information to make a prediction because I don't have anywhere near their level expertise. Besides that the predictions made by climate scientists have been fairly accurate. Interestingly, it is the people who know little about a subject, but are informed by a particular ideology somehow gives them some sort of justification to challenge climate scientists. That sounds to me be more about arrogance. But that is just me!

They distort the problem by leaving out vital facts. For instance, a couple of years ago they were all fired up because it was ""the hottest ________ (month, summer, fill in the blank), but what they left out was that the temperature was just a tiny fraction of a degree above the old record and not even enough to be outside the margin of error for measurement. Claiming that every weather event is ""extreme weather"" that is a result of climate change is both dishonest and fearmongering. What they don't do is tell you is that our records only date back about 300 years and that those records were sketchy worldwide until the 20th century. We know fir a fact that there were nasty hurricanes during the 1700s that took out whole fleets of galleons and that some of them were probably cat 4 or 5 monsters, but without weather records, it's dishonest to project long term data as being significantly worse. Likewise, our tornado records don't date back very far at all. There is simply not enough data to make the claim that tornadoes are getting worse or not based on less than 100 years of solid data. As I said, the correct response of science should be ""So What?"" until we have enough data to make responsible predictions.",UClDy-CxyAEcn8gBme0jttrA,1,Ugwmx9IiMhHmjzwPT-R4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

That&#39;s the year the Warmers love to compare to today, without mentioning that it just happened to be the coldest year in about 70-years. <br /><br />The other reason is that NASA, NOAA, Hadley, and governments around the world (except for one), jigger the temperature data to show warming. Even then it&#39;s only a slight amount. Yes, that&#39;s all they can do after going to the trouble to cheat with the numbers.<br /><br />What they do is lower historical temperatures, and increase today&#39;s, completely tossing out the raw, real numbers.

Earth&#39;s climate is influenced by many variables: solar activity, shifting of the magnetic core, to name a few. The Earth has gone in and out of ice ages many times. The changes are somewhat cyclic. Human-influenced carbon emission since the industrial revolution period is an unnatural anomaly and not part of the cyclic equation so we as a species should be smarter and not test that which is not fully understood. It&#39;s like an experiment that has two possible outcomes. One result is okay and the other result is a failure. But the odds are in favor of failure. We treat of earth, our home, like the great pacific garbage patch is normal.

It is not true that scientists have not studied the Milankovitch cycles to determine if they play any role in the current warming. Each detail of the M Cycles has been studied and provided clear evidence that the M. Cycles do not now impact climate on the earth at this time. For example the eccentricity of earth's orbit is almost a perfect circle the opposite of which occurs during the ice ages. Plus the M Cycles take on the order of a thousand of years to develop and initiate a cooling cycle. And a warming cycle is also not likely because of gradual onset over time. And beyond that the warming of the climate is so closely correlated to the rise in green house gases that no other alternative explanation can explain the current warming.

It goes on to say that the industrial activity started especially after WWII and continued for 20 to 30 years when environmental regulations started to limit the sulphur dioxide pollution.

The weaker the solar field is, the less clouds will be formed due to lack of aerosols in the atmosphere. Hence, it is totally realistic to think that solar activity is a main factor. The physicists working on this hypothesis now is currently making predictions about future temperature and is now chewing on the possibility that we might go into a cold-period in not very long if the magnetic field of the sun will loosen, which they are quite sure it will. I think it is quite a theory to consider. That way, maybe we will also be more open to adapt to the climate system instead of attempting to change it.

The earth&#39;s wobble causes a cyclical change in global climatic patterns. This cycle takes approx 26,000 years , the colder extremes causes polar ice to build up, the warmer extremes cause this polar ice to melt, when this polar ice melts the earth warms or vice versa which will result in a cataclysm as mentioned in the much maligned and misquoted Bible &quot; the Flood&quot;. The people of Dendera, Kemet knew all about this cycle and recorded it on a chart the Zodiac ! Is it coincidental that as the polar ice melts we get more precipitation, rain and snow/hail storms, hurricanes , typhoons etc ? IS it coincidental that they named this 2,100 year period of the Zodiac cycle Aquarius ? What is the meaning of Aquarius ? When would this period peak ? When would this period end ? If the white man was as interested in knowing these things as he was in trying to cover up and then destroy this knowledge in order to claim ownership of it, then the world would not have been scratching their heads today wondering what will occur. Pythagoras theorem , Hippocritic oaths aside, the white man was too busy claiming all the religion and science of the Kemites and falsely claiming it as theirs ( the Great Master Race of Nords and Caucasians ) when the Kemites made it quite clear who they were ! I would suggest that instead of now panicking blaming it on every one and every thing but ourselves ( the white man that is ) he should now go down on his knees and observe the great Ma&#39;atic laws ! pay reparations now to all the peoples of the world for your greed , false hoods, blood lust ! there is still much time for you to repair the hurt done !

The global temperature differences between cold and warm periods were roughly 6 to 8 degrees Celsius (or 10 to 14 F), and it usually took the earth about 10000 to 20000 years to transition from a cold to a warm climate. The current warming trend however has caused the earth to warm by 1° C (or 1.8 F) in just 100 years. So it's easy to calculate that we are currently warming about 20 times faster compared to the natural warming since the last ice age, and it's that rapid speed that worries many scientists because it will make it hard for life to adapt and contribute to mass extinction. Also, according to Milankovic cycles we are currently in a warm period and should expect a slow cooling, yet earth keeps warming rapidly with an accelerating trend. Therefore Milankovic cycles cannot explain the current global warming. Human greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2) are the only reasonable main driver of global warming. So now you're saying that a rise in CO2 lacked behind temperature increases during the last climate changes, which again I agree with. However, your conclusion that therefore CO2 cannot drive global warming _today,_ is wrong! CO2 and temperature are _mutually_ reinforcing, meaning they can both be cause and effect. It's like sparks and fire: Both can cause the other. And when we look further back in earth's history, we actually do see examples where CO2 was the cause of global warming instead of the other way around: Ever heard of ""snowball earth"" when earth's surface was completely frozen? Turns out what eventually melted the ice back then was mostly the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from volcanoes.

Why didn't the UN, come down on outsourcing and globalization knowing that those countries would pollute more than the rest of the developed world. Second, those products which we consume are then placed on massive CO2 polluting container ships, and shipped all the way back to wallmart etc for 'our' convenience. 3rd, one would figure that the UN would call for a halt to globalization and urge that outsourcing be reversed so as to reduce pollution from ocean going vessels but also to promote middle class creation. But lets look at the facts, Asia was given a free pass to pollute, while we were threatened with carbon taxes. Also,...we were told that 'finally'..., 'green jobs', would in fact hire domestic workforce,... and we are to believe that even 'green jobs', would not be outsourced to asia!. We'll I've heard that claim before in certain trade treaties. You know the one where 'more mexicans would buy american made goods', lol. This whole game is based on one simple fact. Climate change,under the auspices of 'green jobs', is just another form of taxation to promulgate outsourcing, and globalization to perpetuate wealth transfer.

It never changes but now it has gone up 1.5 degrees. 1.5 degrees is the point of no return for the Earth and we are there. In fact it will go up 20 degrees in 5 years. The last time there was this much CO2 in the air was 250 million years ago. It was caused by Volcanoes Erupting in Siberia. This released all the Methane from the sea floor, which is happening again right now, if you did research. Methane is a gas 85 times more powerful than CO2. The mass extinction 250 million years ago was called the Permian mass extinction or ""The Great Dying"" . In 200 Years man replicated the atmosphere of the Permian.

Again pointing to that angle of the sun as its the same line the desert belt follows. Just open a map of the planet with country names on it ,place next to the still moment map and see which countries are in that PDO area. If they do temperature measurements at that area then i can predict that they will get highest temperatures there. Just draw a line on the map between North Korea and the USA through the Atlantic ocean, crossing all the land between the 2. That is the desert belt and it is moving, i'll let you figure out to find out in what direction it is moving as that is part of the process of becoming convinced. So verify that and your at the destination, understanding the causing mechanism in all of this. What Really Happened To Global Warming? watch?v=V2IlU3rBJ50&t=9m13s Pacific decadal oscillation The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a robust, recurring pattern of ocean-atmosphere climate variability centered over the mid-latitude Pacific basin. The PDO is detected as warm or cool surface waters in the Pacific Ocean, north of 20°N. Over the past century, the amplitude of this climate pattern has varied irregularly at interannual-to-interdecadal time scales (meaning time periods of a few years to as much as time periods of multiple decades). There is evidence of reversals in the prevailing polarity (meaning changes in cool surface waters versus warm surface waters within the region) of the oscillation occurring around 1925, 1947, and 1977; the last two reversals corresponded with dramatic shifts in salmon production regimes in the North Pacific Ocean. This climate pattern also affects coastal sea and continental surface air temperatures from Alaska to California. During a ""warm"", or ""positive"", phase, the west Pacific becomes cooler and part of the eastern ocean warms; during a ""cool"" or ""negative"" phase, the opposite pattern occurs. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation was named by Steven R. Hare, who noticed it while studying salmon production pattern results in 1997. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation index is the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of monthly sea surface temperature anomalies (SST-A) over the North Pacific (poleward of 20°N) after the global average sea surface temperature has been removed. This PDO index is the standardized principal component time series. A PDO 'signal' has been reconstructed as far back as 1661 through tree-ring chronologies in the Baja California area.

The 100 000 year Milankovitch Cycles Is an Ice Age Coming? | Space Time | PBS Digital Studios-PBS Space Time 15:27 watch?v=ztninkgZ0ws&t=2m05s • Axial tilt, From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, that 41 000 year cycle In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angle between an object's rotational axis and its orbital axis, or, equivalently, the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane. It differs from orbital inclination. At an obliquity of 0 degrees, the two axes point in the same direction; i.e., the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. Earth's obliquity oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle; Earth's mean obliquity is currently 23°26′12.2″ (or 23.43673°) and decreasing. Over the course of an orbital period, the obliquity usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background of stars. This causes one pole to be directed more toward the Sun on one side of the orbit, and the other pole on the other side—the cause of the seasons on Earth. • Heating temperature is cause, more CO2 is effect, without cause there wont be an effect ! So the whole Climate Change misunderstanding leans on the fact that those that explain it, blame effect for the cause. So their at it the complete wrong way around it and that is causing the confusion around it ! watch?v=rweblFwt-BM&t=51s",UCY5M5BFiaJq2kD2DsaXM_jg,1,UgxQIwbiU7UN-P-Q06t4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

To me it is unbelievable that most scientists do not know anything about this. The video maker does mention precession, yet uses other year amounts it is a cycle of 26 000 years, so where that 41 000 years comes from, no idea. Just see the geological research, there weather changes occur various times in the researched data and the cycles prove gives is 26 000 years. So that 26 000 year cycle is not only mentioned on the wiki artikle of precession, but you can actually validate it by looking at geological research. History archaeology and geology can actually provide a lot of real proof. So why people keep focusing on stats that do not take geology and history in account, i just don't get it, as geology completely proves the whole climate change cycle to be a natural cycle of earth. Its a repeating cycle and the prove is there in soil research that it repeated itself various times. So what makes people think that we can stop it from happening ? To stop it we should stop precession and we simply can't nor should as then 1 area stays in that most sun hours region all the time and then that nature will never heal itself. Now we know the desert areas will be fertile again in the future as they have been in the past after desertification. So the prove in data is all there, this is not a mystery. First i had to refute Alien theories by use of archaeology and cultures, and now i have to use history and geology to show what creates climate change ? The world really needs more historians and geologists ! Geological research of core samples of soil, in which you see the climate cycle repeating each 26 000 years that is sync with precession How The Sahara Desert Was Made - It Used To Be Green - Full Documentary watch?v=LIAkJg8knTI Here you see these same effects influencing China which is also in the desert belt you learned about in the previous docu Can the 'Great Green Wall' stop desertification in China? watch?v=QyeBxcvUJIU Here more effects that the wobble and the angle of earth compared to the sun is causing this. The area that gets most sun hours, the desert belt, is moving ! And that movement is moving sync to the tilt of Earth, that wobble cycle named precession. And here you see that this is the mechanism, as the Arctic and Antarctic get different amounts of sun hours cos of the angle their at to the sun. One gets more sun hours and melts the other gets less sun hours and ice grows. NASA - The Arctic and the Antarctic Respond in Opposite Ways watch?v=J_WWXGGWZBE Haven't found USA info for this but never looked for it either. I bet you can find prove for this in the USA as well as part of the desert belt lies in the USA. So there you should also be able to see that the desert is moving to one side and that the opposite side of that desert is getting more fertile, as that gets less sun hours cos of the precessional angle. It is so bizarre to me that people do not know this as there are so many ways to prove this by scientific ways. But there you have it and this is not even a worthless opinion but you can validate this yourself as now you know where to look at to be able to validate or disprove it. You can't fake those core samples. Statistics you can forge, so it is not even science to use only statistics as a stat is not prove. Giving a way to verify is what science is about, not saying this is how it is and you should just believe it. Just see how easy this was to explain, you can't tell me that I'm the only one in the world that sees this, so why do they not speak up ? THIS is the reason we have that whole flat earth movement, cos we scientists just forgot how to explain things, and expect people to believe us without us providing ways they can verify things. I stand for science so there you have it ! Hope you verify it as verification should be the thing to convince, THAT is true Science !

Although I&#39;m not a vegan or vegetarian, there is truth to the fact that we don&#39;t need animal farms to survive. They only exist because people eat meat. We would also have more food if we stuck to plant products because animals use much more food than they produce (obviously). There&#39;s also an idea that meat contributes to cardiovascular disease (Watch &quot;Forks Over Knives&quot;).<br /><br /><br /> Like many issues, global warming is very complex and there isn&#39;t one right or wrong answer. I will say this though... I&#39;m not sure if we can truly blame humans or natural global changes for temperature changes, but if it is us, getting rid of our massive animal farming operations would be the largest step we can take to fix it. For those of you who say it&#39;s our vehicles that do it: A... greenhouse gas emissions data says otherwise...B...Getting rid of our fossil fuels right at this instant would mean certain death to the global economy.<br /><br /><br />The other thing which makes things difficult, is the fact that we really have very little temperature data. Any data taken before satellites took data doesn&#39;t account for the earth as a whole. A dude on a ship doesn&#39;t give us accurate readings or earth as a whole. If we had 1000 years of satellite data, then we would have a better answer to if we are the problem or not. Satellite data is the only surefire, accurate proof of global changes which we have. Yet, it has only existed since the 70&#39;s (50 years). <br /><br /><br />How are we supposed to work with 50 years of data to prove a problem that, if it exists, has existed since humans began to industrialize?<br /><br /><br /> In order to have real data to work with, we need satellite temperature readings that start back before humans even had a chance to harm the earth. Yet we still only have 50 years worth. <br /><br /><br />Anyone who wishes to challenge my ideas... please be civil.

How do you think these mass farmed animals get fed? In fact, we would have to farm plants LESS if we stopped animal farming because we wouldn't have to produce 3 pounds of feed for every 1 pound of meat they produce. I'm not well educated in the topic of nutritional needs of people like the eskimos. However, they would not have to give up their diet if we were to scale back mass farming. In fact, we wouldn't have to completely eradicate the animal farming industry to make an impact. Simply scaling it back would do wonders. Besides, don't many of them hunt in a traditional style anyway? Even for those who, in theory, need meat to survive in an urban setting, they could still get meat, just not from the commercial producers that we know.

What affects its luminosity & thus solar wind effect on earth are the solar phenom the Sun goes thru, namely sunspots. The Sun has frequently had sunspots in the last half century & this increases the effect on the earth. This is how. The Sunspot is a dimmer cooler region where the Sun's radiation as it makes its way up thru the core to the surface gets caught in an agitated magnetic flux. Normally the emission of radiation spirals straight out but the magnetic flux twists all the waves so they spread out in directions on the photosphere. This then pushes stronger radiation out across the photosphere & the effect is more of the Sun's surface is emitting stronger radiation which when we receive it gives rise to some hot temps. The Sun, by no means a remarkable magnitude star, does have its own weather & there is nothing to support that the Sun is cooling off or that its engine is cooling. Some 4-5 billion years from now, the Sun will make its move off the Main Sequence & over time expand to the red giant phase. Red giants are very bright b/c of their size, not because of their temp. Red is the receding end of the Doppler effect. However red giants are enormous & the Sun will expand its radius out to our position & possible Mars. At this point we will liquefy. After a good amount of time here the dna of the Sun will collapse it to a small white dwarf. The Sun is not of the supernova type based on its dna.",UC02T8Ooh8GBC4mwZAjK1Baw,1,Ugz-ozWmwA6ebTb_Swp4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Lamps and microwave ovens both release electromagnetic radiation, but microwave ovens release it at a specific frequency which allows the water molecules inside of the food to heat.

If you have such information please tell me where I can study it. I am not contesting the CO2 emissions or its effect. From:   http://www.radioactivity.eu.com/site/pages/Chain_Reaction.htm “It is the chain reaction process that is used in reactors and nuclear weapons to generate a large number of fissions. In a reactor, the propagation of fissions takes place in a controlled manner, in a nuclear weapon in an uncontrolled, explosive manner.” From:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain “Half-lives have been determined in laboratories for many radioisotopes (or radionuclides). These can range from nearly instantaneous to as much as 10^19 years or more” From:  http://www.softschools.com/formulas/chemistry/radioactive_halflife_formula/113/ “A radioactive half-life refers to the amount of time it takes for half of the original isotope to decay. For example, if the half-life of a 50.0 gram sample is 3 years, then in 3 years only 25 grams would remain. During the next 3 years, 12.5 grams would remain and so on.” Many nuclear explosions and nuclear power station disasters have happened in the northern hemisphere; has anyone calculated the amount of “energy” that these events have generated? How much “extra” energy has been created by all nuclear activities since uranium’s radioactivity was discovered?  By “extra” energy, I mean the “creation” of daughter and granddaughter elements that fission, creating more energy than the original “parent” elements would have released. Yes; It is quite funny watching it all play out, however,  IF ”so many people” happen to guess right about the subject, then it will not be “funny” anymore.",UC8X1AUzXFX_Oi_SdtWllUkw,1,UgyVgyAxU9bVRB53SNJ4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Everything they investigate leads them straight back to human CO2 emissions. The science involved in AGW has been in progress for at least 120 years and is well understood and continually imrpoving further. Secondly if anyone is going to bring nuclear radiation into the AGW frame, surely you do understand that nuclear radiation has a half life decay rate specific to the nuclear material employed. That decay rate can range from hours through hundreds or thousands of years. The pont is it decays anyway, as in it gets weaker over time. The variation in heating between the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere is well understood and documented in the AGW related science literature. The reason as I understand it, is related to the lack of overall relative land mass in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere, resulting in the vast expanses of oceans in the southern hemisphere buffering the rate of heating in the southern hemisphere. But as always I am sure a relevant research scientist would probably expand on that base with further detail. The funny thing is that the average person in the street, willingly, even transparently, trusts science in all sorts of areas of our contemporary, technological and comfortable lifestyles. Because science succeeds in real terms and arrives at the surest truths about reality. But so many people all of a sudden think they know better than scientists about AGW.

Why is the northern hemisphere warmer than the southern hemisphere?

Although the current fission products or daughter elements that may be released to the environment from existing reactors do not have enough energy to compete with the energy from the sun, the fact that the “active” elements remain that way for thousands of years causes a situation where the “energy” or “heat” accumulates over the years. The nuclear experiments started back in the 1940s and during the time from then to now there have been many “leaks” of the “energetic” nuclear material into the environment. My suspicion is that this “accumulated” nuclear energy may be sufficient to add and affect the energy that the Earth retains.

CO2 kept going up at record levels ... and temperature dropped? He just forgot to mention that CO2 doesn&#39;t lead temperature change (it has to if it&#39;s the cause). It&#39;s the other way around (an increase in temp heats the ocean that then releases more CO2, which is what actually explains part of the relationship). So no, CO2 change does not cause an overall temperature change. The small CO2-greenhouse-gas affect on global temperature reverses in a few weeks when CO2 also affects the growth of bacteria and flora that grow more and cool the earth more.

The most important is that the sun's output is so remarkably consistent (and for millions of years) that the heat we receive from it doesn't vary by more than about a degree up or down, whether during a solar maximum or a solar minimum. That's why it is among the weakest of climate drivers. The sun, in fact, is currently in the midst of its minimal phase, which usually lowers average global temps slightly. But that's not happening. We're continuing to warm. Our outer atmosphere, on the other hand, shows slight cooling, according to NASA satellite monitoring since 1978. A cooling outer atmosphere and a simultaneous warming inner atmosphere can mean only one thing; it's not the sun. It's a greenhouse effect.

I can prove anything if you allow me to adjust the data. And WHY are the climate scientists that do not favor &quot;global warming&quot; NOT granted funds? A climate scientist that does not support &quot;global warming&quot; will need to get another job or his/her family will starve. Why are they not properly published in the journals? Why? Why? WHY? <br /><br />And just why are there so many top scientists from other fields that doubt the work of these false scientists and doubt that the earth is really warming that much, if at all? <br /><br />I live in south Texas, within a few miles of the Gulf of Mexico. My house sits on a coastal plane, a few feet above sea level. According to the &quot;global warming&quot; proponents, I should be at least knee deep in salt water by now. Heck, from some of the predictions, I should have been flooded by the Gulf well over 20 years ago. But the last time I checked, my feet are dry and they have been. My grass is not seaweed. We do not have any facilities for pumping water out of the area, just canals that flow by gravity to the Gulf. They are not overflowing. The rain water drains down those canals to the Gulf. Even when we have a hurricane, they drain the water to the Gulf. I have experienced many hurricanes. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit my area and dropped over 30 inches of rain. That is a lot of rain. Some nearby areas had as much as 40 inches of rain. There was some local flooding, but I can attest to the fact that my home did not get even a single inch of flood water: it remained high and DRY. All of that 30 inches drained away via gravity through those canals to the Gulf of Mexico. GRAVITY only works DOWNHILL! Most of the city and of other neighboring cities was the same: the only flooding was due to clogged or inadequate drainage systems on a local basis. NOT due to a rise in sea level. <br /><br />So, keep adjusting your data. Keep telling everyone that mankind is evil and must change. Keep allowing Al Gore to run HIS inefficient homeS (yes, he has more than one) with over 20 times more electricity as mine uses. And keep the profits rolling in for those inefficient companies that WASTE our resources by developing super expensive, alternative energy sources that, when the costs in dollars AND IN OUR NATURAL RESOURCES far outstrip the extremely more efficient and EXTREMELY GREENER sources that they want to get rid of. <br /><br />And just where is all this money (which represents resources which you claim to be saving) coming from? Not from Al Gore! I bet he pays zero taxes. It comes from the average tax payer. Steal from the poor and give to the rich. And all in the name of saving the planet.

The hottest decade on record, was the 1930&#39;s! <br />It&#39;s on record, established &amp; confirmed, that NASA has adjusted historical temperature records since the &#39;90&#39;s.

New tech earns greater profits for corporations. C. Corporations fund the studies. D. Global Warming Alamism creates a consumer demand for &quot;new tech&quot; Check it out for yourself. <br />2. Clouds do not cool the earth. Water vapour (clouds), contributes for more greatly &amp; directly to a greenhouse warming effect than does CO2. <br />3. CO2 represents only 0.04% of the earths atmosphere. That&#39;s only 4 out of every 10,000 parts.

Further, your comment ""it helps to know actual history"" is laughable, & presumptions. As you might have gleaned from the post you responded to, I lived through the 70's (well before actually), the specific period your remark referred to. So it shouldn't surprise you really, if I trust my knowledge of that period of history, as I experienced it & know how it transpired, - over what you've learnt from some revisionist texts. Because you're passionate & seem well intentioned, I'll indulge you with a response, in hope you might take pause. Firstly, a simple fact check for you. For the last 450,000 of earth's history, at least, CO2 levels have followed temperatures, not the other way around. To clarify that for you: After temperatures went up & then CO2 went up, conversely, after temperatures went down, then CO2 followed. CO2 is not the causitive factor. With respect to your response regarding NASA's changing (for you I can be gentle & call it ""adjusting"") temperature records: Regrettably, your shouting ""NO SCIENTIFIC WRONGDOING OR FRAUD WAS FOUND"", gives your response no added validity. To be clear, all your response says, is - STATISTICAL TEMPERATURE RECORDS WERE ADJUSTED AND SOMEHOW THIS HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED. I honestly hope you stop and think about that. Now to your ""drop of ink"" & ""trace of arcenic"" analogies. I can only guess someone offered those two nuggets in primary school & they've served you well ever since. They are not relevant analogies in this conversation. Remember, CO2 follows temperature - if it were the other way around, based on the level of responsiveness you're running with, there are times in the earths history when based on CO2 levels temperatures should theoretically have significantly higher than was actually the case. Sorry, it's late here, I am going to try sum up my response to your last 3 paragraphs all at once. 70's, sea levels & ice: Just as the modern day narrative of ""global warming"" has already been scaled back to ""climate change"", with every crisis date that has failed to arrive on time, the scientific community has changed the historical narrative on the '70's expectation of an ice age, to ""no, we never really believed that"" (just they weren't saying ""no"" back then). If as you say, the cooling period of the' 70's was corrected through action taken by industry, driven by legislation, (obviously kicked off by those clever little scientists) to reduce carbon pollutants. Only one problem with all that, the aerosols to which you referred, were at the root of a cooling problem (hard to know now, what with the way the narrative gets changed), then in reality they were caused by some particularly large volcanic eruption at the time. Sea levels are rising in some parts of the northern hemisphere, static around the equator & contrary to popular belief, the land mass of pacific islands like the Solomons & Fiji is increasing. Overall sea level increase is about 1mm per year. Nature produces 97% of the CO2, & it's production is not a constant & yet, despite none of the indicators suggesting so, all the crisis dates falling ever further back, we still think our 3% contribution is 100%, while naturally occurring levels of change, occurr at naturally occurring rates.

The heat of the 1930s was found only in the United States, which represents 2% of the world's land mass and can't be used to represent the globe. In the very warmest year, 1934, South America, Australia, Asia, half of Africa and all of Alaska were cooler than normal. Nobody has fraudulently changed climate data. Investigations with Climategate and the accusations against NOAA were thoroughly investigated by independent panels and NO SCIENTIFIC WRONGDOING OR FRAUD WAS FOUND. The difference between a trace of arsenic and a slightly larger trace is death. C02 seems minuscule and trivial to most, but not if you know physics. Nitrogen, oxygen and argon make up 99% of the atmosphere but neither absorb light or heat. C02 does. Think of how a single drop of ink permeates an entire glass of water with color. Think of C02's ability to block and re-radiate heat the same way. Ground-based spectroscopy clearly identifies trapped heat passing through molecules of C02 and returning to earth. It's not guesswork. It's empirical evidence. The oil industry is delighted that so few people know the physics; all the easier to pull the wool over their eyes. C02-warming accelerates evaporation, filling the atmosphere with additional moisture that in itself acts as a greenhouse gas to act synergistically with C02 to raise temps still further.  The ""coming Ice Age"" scare of the 70s arose from sulfate aerosol pollution, from burning coal. Sulfate aerosols reflect sunlight and cool the planet exactly the way volcanic aerosols do. The cooling period of the 40s and 50s was due to our growing emissions of those very pollutants. When we passed the Clean Air Act (1963, 1970, and 1990), aerosol pollution dropped sharply, leaving C02 as the dominant pollutant to warm global temperature again. It helps to know the actual history. Satellite altimeter data and worldwide tide gauge data agree; sea level is not only rising but accelerating. When two different methodologies agree on the numbers, it's best we sit up and take notice. The Antarctic ice is not growing, it is shrinking. You're confusing surrounding sea ice with the ice over land there. The sea ice expanded for several years but since 2014 has diminished dramatically. Over 150 studies have been conducted to measure Antarctic ice; one study suggested snow in the interior may be increasing, but that study has been overturned by follow-up studies and more comprehensive data. The findings: Antarctica is melting at an unprecedented rate.",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1,UgzNPDJzKZgPCbrdM254AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The sun has been remarkably inactive for years and it is, in fact, at the peak of its minimal phase as we speak. We should be cooling slightly as a result. But we're not. (July the hottest month in recorded history. The last five years the hottest in recorded history. The oceans the hottest in recorded history.) What you need to know is that earth's outer atmosphere has actually cooled, according to NASA satellite monitoring since 1978. Yet our inner atmosphere continues to warm unabated. That's clear evidence that it can't be the sun but a greenhouse effect. Ground-based spectroscopy clearly shows heat passing through molecules of C02 and methane in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth. It's not guesswork. It too is empirical evidence of a greenhouse effect. Of all the climate's forcing agents, the sun is among the weakest. Most lay peoplpe don't understand that. But the fact is that the sun is amazingly consistent in its warming effects, never veering more than a degree on average in either direction, whether in the midst of a grand solar maximum or a grand solar minimum.

That's according to the most comprehensive study of climate history ever undertaken, involving a small army of scientists who gathered proxy data from around the world. It makes complete sense when considering the Milankovitch Cycles, changes in Earth's orbit, axial tilt and wobble. These cycles alter how much sunlight (and therefore heat) we receive. They come around every several thousand years and are entirely predictable. The peak of the last one was about 9000 years ago, and the earth was quite warm. Today all three Milankovitch Cycles, however, are in phases favoring cooling, not warming. So why are we warming? The sun is also in the minimal phase of its 11-year cycle and we should be cooling slightly from that as well. In fact, earth's outer atmosphere has indeed cooled to match the sun's lower output (according to NASA satellite data), yet our inner atmosphere continues to warm unabated. Empirical evidence of a greenhouse effect? One would think. Ground-based spectroscopic analysis clearly shows heat passing through molecules of C02 and methane in the atmosphere and re-radiating back to earth. More empirical evidence of a greenhouse effect?

With the desalination water done ,with electromagnetic energy producing cleaner water than water thousands of years ago. The water pumped up to the top of the dome ,to fireman hoses on detachable lines , and swivels.carried to inland hardlines..Anchored through the center ,so they can be interchangeable, moved out of harms way the same way oil derricks are moved . To be capable of bringing them to shipyards for repair, or moved to different locations for different growing seasons. <br /><br />The water can be pumped thousands of miles ,inland to desert farms ,that have in ground desert homes ,cooled by conducting cooling systems on pre irrigation water systems.With two lines ,one for irrigation ,one for homes drinking water. <br /><br />The best solar panels known to mankind ,are also the best energy production bulk producing plant with seed oil that is exactly like crude oil in every Way except three .one when burned it produces natural carbon dioxide not monoxide poison. Two it can be transported worldwide in seed form without environmentally dangerous spills. Three A biodegradable environmentally friendly plastic can be produced. With 30 million tons of plastic dumped into the oceans each year now .All of it can be eaten by fish , or by microorganisms , or the bottom of the oceans food chain ,to make our oceans healthier. <br /><br />I would like to Quote the Great Albert Einstein Quote “ Raise new Questions, explore new possibilities, Regard old problems from A new angle “<br /><br />My name is Kendon Erland Curtis this concept was A God given Dream. I realize how naive this sounds however I was instructed to share the concept with the world 🌎. I am not A Democrat nor am I A republican. I am a conservative Constitutionalist American. I live in Conyers Georgia America . It is my belief ,that the oil conglomerates are best suited to develop this God given concept. I respectfully ask ,that whoever develops this concept seeks out my family to give them A small percentage ,of the gross profits. This is what I believe this concept is capable of.<br /><br />1- energy from oceans waves, and the ebb, and flow of the oceans tides used to produce the energy needed for the electromagnetic desalination process, and pumping capable of pumping clean water thousands of miles inland to desert farms.<br /><br />2- the cleanest water systems in thousands of years ,because of the electromagnetic desalination process.<br /><br />3-in ground desert homes ,cooled by conducting cooling systems ,with pre irrigation water, and building materials made with the hemp fiber.<br /><br />4- carbines separates the seed from the foliage ,that is left in the desert with herd animals following the carbines , that also bail ,and kick the bailed stalk into wagons for transport to building materials facilities , and clothing facilities then the extra ,and scrap to be burned in coal type burning facilities for electricity right there where the hemp plant loves the carbon dioxide converting it to Oxygen ,with the year round rotation of crops. <br /><br />5- wile burning the stalk of the best bulk production plant known to mankind. The cane sugar plant being the closest second, and only produces 10% of the bulk of the hemp plant. Also cane sugar plant is not environmentally friendly, because of where it is grown, and the chemicals used in its production that the runoff is though to exasperate red tide. <br />The hemp plant has the added benefit of producing hydrogen gas for compressed gas.,thereby solving the age old problem ,of producing hydrogen gas,when it takes x amount of energy to produce x amount of energy . With the best solar panels known to mankind the hemp plant.<br /><br />7- I saved the best for last ,the seed oil that can be bioengineered to produce NO thc wile production ,of the biggest seed oil possible , that can be used to produce biodegradable environmentally friendly plastics ,that fish, and animals can eat, and become healthier. <br /><br />The recycling center useing fans to separate the plastic ,so it can be used as winter fodder for the same animals that follow the carbines trapping the carbon in the soil. <br />This process of using herd animals has been proven to rejuvenate desert land. It all ties to roaming herds like buffalo. Trapping the carbon in the soil wile providing A food source. <br />Imagine the desert flush ,with green that is the best carbon dioxide to Oxygen conversion rate plant known to mankind .wile also being the best solar energy panels known to mankind. <br /><br />Think about the peace, and prosperity ,this is capable of creating. Jobs, jobs,jobs! Nothing creates peace like prosperity. <br /><br />My father was a geologist scientist know, that old growth forests burned continuously throughout our evolution. They dumped tons ,upon tons ,of natural carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. However the same old growth forests ,that burned as A result of beetle, blight, disease, and droughts often caused by solar flares. Also was the conversion back to Oxygen.<br />What if covering our desert land ,with farms ,that create the best carbon dioxide conversion rate plant known to mankind is the answer? <br />Remember the Einstein Quote!<br />What do we have to loose?",UCgUpIJmKlDL1I_s8o3HMrQA,0,UgziWDhDS5c56rEkS-54AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

ALL of these factors have been considered and measured. Sea level rise is happening. Not only is it happening, it is accelerating.  Satellite altimeter readings agree with the rate measured by tide gauges all over the world. When you have two methodologies agreeing on the numbers, it's time to look at the actual data. You should have read the U.S. Military-sponsored study on the Pacific Islands. Stop thinking in inches or millimeters. Think STORM SURGES. For every notch you go up in sea level, storm surges flow exponentially further inland, permanently contaminating fresh water sources and making the islands unlivable. Complete and permanent inundation is a slow process. Storm surges, however, are not.   Ask Boston how they liked their record-breaking storm surge last year and the millions they're investing to stop the next one. Ask the City Dock neighborhood of Annapolis, who flood as often as 65 times a year and must close not only shops but entire streets. Ask Miami, Bangladesh, the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Ask parts of Queens, NY. All are fighting increasing high tide flooding. Here are the official stats from NOAA: High tide flooding has doubled along the southeastern coast in the last 30 years alone. It's up 75% along the northeast. Thermal expansion and melting from Greenland and Antarctica are working together to accelerate the rise. We know this not because of politics but because of science.

The International Council for Clean Transportation and the IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute find that as of 2019, lifecycle emissions for electric cars were about 3 times lower than for conventional cars.

We know about past climates because of evidence left in tree rings, layers of ice in glaciers, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. For example, bubbles of air in glacial ice trap tiny samples of Earth’s atmosphere, giving scientists a history of greenhouse gases that stretches back more than 800,000 years. The chemical make-up of the ice provides clues to the average global temperature. When global warming has happened at various times in the past two million years, it has taken the planet about 5,000 years to warm 5 degrees. The Earth is heating up faster than that right now, but there will always be exceptions. Global warming scientists lost all credibility when they faked their research in the past couple of decades with their global warming computer models. They did it to keep getting funding. It also seems so many people perpetuate lies to achieve political agendas. The truth is one large volcano eruption can cause much more problems with carbon dioxide than the pollution caused by humans in America right now. It is also amazing to see the good work companies are doing in America to operate with less and less pollution. The Paris Accord was a big scheme for the rest of the world to steal money from U.S. tax payers. The worst polluter countries were being allowed to continue their extreme polluting while stealing our money.",UCA37ekRSJZp2gcSgYKJec3g,0,UgzI-O7N-zJfFMLxq-p4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Because both NOAA and the scientists in the Climategate scandal were completely exonerated by independent investigative panels, which found no scientific fraud or manipulating of data. I'm sorry to fact-check you, Mark, but according to the U.S. Geological Survey, ALL of the world's volcanoes, including the underwater ones, emit an average of 200 million tons of C02 per year. Automobiles and industry emit 24 BILLION tons per year. Google it. Nobody was going to ""steal"" our money with the Paris Agreement. The world's most egregious emitters of C02, right up until 2005, was the United States, which means we're more responsible for the climate change mess we're in now than anybody else. We led the world in emissions for DECADES. And measuring by per capita, we're STILL emitting more C02 than anyone else. Most Chinese and Indians do not own cars. Most Americans do. Most drivers around the world drive small cars. Americans drive behemoths. We are not innocent. And limiting climate change now will cost us far less than dealing with it later, when European high tide flooding alone will cost taxpayers an estimated $1 trillion per year by 2100. American cities, meanwhile, are already spending billions to stop the increasing high tide flooding damage that has doubled along the southeastern coast in just the last 30 years, according to NOAA.",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1,UgzI-O7N-zJfFMLxq-p4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

In the outside world, however, it's more complex. The latest studies show that high C02 also depletes staple crops of their natural defenses against insects which, without masses of pesticides, devour them. High C02 also strips them of their zinc, iron and protein content, making them less nutritious for human consumption. High C02 also traps heat, which accelerates evaporation, filling the atmosphere with additional moisture which in itself is a greenhouse gas that works synergistically with C02 to raise temps even further. The upshot is that the additional moisture must be released, and increasingly it is coming in torrents, according to EPA statistics since 1958. Epic rain washes away topsoils and fertilizer and decimate crops. But it's worse than that. 9 of 10 of the costliest hurricanes in American history all ocurred after the year 2000. In the past, the highest damage came in the form of wind. Today it's epic rain and storm surges. Not at all good for crops.  In dry parts of the world, high C02 does just the opposite; it aggravates and lengthens droughts and increases desertification. Again, not so good for crops.

The moisture in itself is a greenhouse gas which works synergistically with C02 to increase warming further. Normal moisture in the atmosphere isn't considered a forcing agent because it is part of our everyday climate system. Anything above or below the norm, like a solar maximum or a solar minimum, would be considered a forcing. That's why H20 is often left out of discussions. C02 is by far the most powerful climate forcing agent. Scientists mark the start of modern global record keeping at about 1880, because earlier data simply didn't include enough of the world's locations to produce accurate readings. After 1880, yes. The blazing year of 1934 in the U.S. is completely irrelevant compared to the world's climate that year. It doesn't matter what the hottest year was in the U.S. The global temps are rising steadily. The factors at play in the U.S. then are not at play now. Years of intense drought contributed to the heatwaves of the 30s by depleting soil moisture, which reduced the moderating effects of evaporation. The Dust Bowl effect of creating barren land exasperated the situation, as barren land absorbs more heat than grasslands do. NOAA is often accused by contrarians and conspiracy theorists of fudging data. Although NOAA does indeed adjust data when necessary (and there are many reasons why adjustments are necessary), there is no evidence to show that they've lied. Due to ongoing controversy, the Department of Commerce engaged the highly respected MITRE organization to form an independent investigative panel of respected scientists unrelated to NOAA to look into accusations of misconduct and data tampering there. Their findings were released last December.

Your second issue is that the US record makes up almost 40% of the long term record while virtually the rest of the entire globe has no long term temperature records. It also accounts for virtually the same for the current record for actual records. BTW, don't let your AGW compadres hear your heresy admitting 1934 as the hottest on record in the USA. Also, the temps you claim don't work so well, for example, are you aware of the what the Bolivian Hotspot issue was? How it drove the entire SA averages higher? Well, until further adjustments were made in the data sets... Nope, it is simple, when your models keep failing and the only response is adjustments of the data to fit the model instead of changing the model to fit the data, then by basic mathematical modeling rules, and heck, good old Occam's Razor, the models are wrong.

""Scrutinizing the carbon cycle and CO2 residence time in the atmosphere Climate scientists presume that the carbon cycle has come out of balance due to the increasing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change. This is made responsible for the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over recent years, and it is estimated that the removal of the additional emissions from the atmosphere will take a few hundred thousand years. Since this goes along with an increasing greenhouse effect and a further global warming, a better understanding of the carbon cycle is of great importance for all future climate change predictions. We have critically scrutinized this cycle and present an alternative concept, for which the uptake of CO2 by natural sinks scales proportional with the CO2 concentration. In addition, we consider temperature dependent natural emission and absorption rates, by which the paleoclimatic CO2 variations and the actual CO2 growth rate can well be explained. The anthropogenic contribution to the actual CO2 concentration is found to be 4.3%, its fraction to the CO2 increase over the Industrial Era is 15% and the average residence time 4 years.""",UCqYKAWM1xd024Vd9osC6IoA,1,UgyEgwRHnNxVWvX8Lv14AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Albedo is also important, but here we are running into a huge problem with the melting of the ice caps, which reflect sunlight. Personally, I think we will need to do some geoengineering (like increasing albedo) but we should also consider a dramatic reduction in the amount of fossil fuels we waste.

If you need to reduce the heat capture from the greenhouse effect you need to have surfaces designed to reflect sun's energy so the energy is no longer available during the night to be captured by greenhouse gasses like CO2 and H2O. That is why cities and roads are always hotter than forest areas. The focus should be in maintaining same or reducing sun's energy warehousing from man made structures and not reducing CO2 which has a very small effect when compare with other greenhouse gasses like H2O, methane, and nitrous oxide (N2O). Even a dessert with white sand reflects all sun's energy back to space almost instantly lowering night temperatures and providing no heat convection for the sun's energy to be captured by any of the greenhouse gasses.

In my lifetime I have seen it snow in July in lower Michigan when we should have been in the 80s-90s. A summer where the average temps were 10-20 degrees colder than normally. I have seen March with temps soaring into the 80s and 90s but in the last 20 years it&#39;s been in the 30&#39;s 40&#39;s and no spring until May.

People will tell you anecdotally that having reached old age the sea level where they live has never changed in their lifetime. There is plenty of photographic evidence from the 19th century to provide comparison. The Statue of Liberty, built in the 1880’s, is often depicted semi submerged in media scare stories warning about global warming. A quick search on google of pictures from the 19th century compared to today shows no change around the famous landmark. Both Singapore and Monaco have increased their landmass by about 30% since the 1960’s through land reclamation from the sea. The new land is obviously prime Ocean front development land. Similar ocean front or river front development has been taking place all over the world because it is the most popular place to build. Take for instance the Palm development in Dubai or Canary Wharf and the Nine Elms developments on the River Thames in London. In New York there is the massive New York City comprehensive Waterfront Plan which will involve large land reclamation projects as well as the massive new Hudson Yards waterfront development. There are huge development plans in China, India, Asia and the Middle East for new waterfront cities and infrastructure including the vast $100 billion dollar Forest city built across four newly reclaimed islands in Malaysia. All of these developments would be vulnerable to sea level rise if it were a threat but obviously it’s not. The rhetoric does not match the actions anywhere around the world. The authorities say one thing then do differently, it would be quite easy to move planning permission 4 feet up hill to allow for the ‘predicted’ sea level rise over the next century. It was reported 30 years ago that the Maldives would be under water in 30 years. Instead today the Maldives have actually increased their land mass and there’s a lot of expensive waterfront villas being built to attract wealthy people to buy holiday homes on the islands. You can see more evidence of sea level fraud here <a href=""https://youtu.be/e82smfcypUc%E2%80%A8"">https://youtu.be/e82smfcypUc </a><br />The Level of co2 in the atmosphere is at almost the lowest level in the Earths history. The Earth began with an atmosphere containing at least 20% co2 and possibly as much as 50%. Over time the co2 has dissolved into the sea and been converted into rocks as well as consumed and held by the Earth’s biomass or converted into fossil fuels. Therefore rising co2 from today’s trace level of 0.04% is not going to pose an existential threat. See professor Ian Plimer for more geological historical facts. <a href=""https://youtu.be/5fZrRG6E_3I%E2%80%A8"">https://youtu.be/5fZrRG6E_3I </a><br />Earth has been a lot warmer by as much as 14 degrees c. Therefore if the temperature of the Earth was going to spiral out of control it would have done so then. The Antarctic landmass was previously connected to South America which forced the warm oceans currents coming down from the equator to go around it which kept it warm. The fossil records on Antarctica show that it was covered in lush forests. When Antarctica separated through tectonic activity the warm currents were able to divert past it and it began to freeze providing an air conditioning unit for the Earth. Prior to this there was no ice on Earth. Today the Antarctic is protected from warming by circumpolar current that shields it from warm currents. ... <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current%E2%80%A8"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current </a><br />The Antarctic can’t melt. The Antarctic is twice the size of Australia. The ice has been there for 30 million years plus. The ice coverage is up to 15,000 feet thick and averages 3,000 feet thick. The average daily temperature is minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit and the melting point of ice is plus 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore the temperature would need to rise by 90 degrees Fahrenheit to even allow the ice to start melting. This is not possible in a time line of less than many millions of years which would be needed to allow plate tectonics to alter the geography of the planet sufficiently. The volume of ice is not decreasing in the Antarctic. <br />The Greenland ice sheet is melting but the world will have frozen over again before 10% of the ice has melted. The Greenland ice sheet is losing 200 cubic kilometres of ice per year but given that it has an ice volume of 2,850,000 cubic kilometres it would take a 100 years to melt 0.7% of the total volume or a thousand years to melt 7%. Due to the varying orbit of the planet we will have entered the next 100,000 year ice age glacial period by that time. <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet</a> ...Arctic ice refuses to melt as ordered..<a href=""https://youtu.be/vwUhJaQVi-M"">https://youtu.be/vwUhJaQVi-M</a>",UCWJPvoLRPXecFTSLjGdtLnA,0,UgyAECq7KsKUUV_fWmF4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Human caused green house gas emissions are REALLY warning the Earth beyond what would of been, if humans were not burning vast amounts of Fossil fuels every single hour of every single day ( in science the use of CAPITALS doesn&#39;t make anything more &quot;Real&quot;. Research/Evidence is what science users to increase it&#39;s confidence in something. Not merely trying to persuade people that something is &quot;real&quot; or not &quot;real&quot;.(i.e. Science is not the same as politics).<br /><br /><br />Extinction is irreversible. For everything else there are methods to make improvements.<br /><br />The many variables (human activities) that are adding to anthropogenic climate change can be managed in a way that reverses how much the climate changes in the future. Within the context of the Earth&#39;s systems that contribute towards the climate, it&#39;s never too late to transitions towards a more sustainable culture (Some, not all, monetary biased (corrupt) fossil fuel companies just want to burn all they can). However, it&#39;s taken hundred&#39;s of years of human activity (e.g. CO2 emissions, deforestation etc etc) to bring about a human changed climate, so it will naturally take many years for humans to help restore some of these environmental issues. I.e .The potential for a green economy is vast &amp; the money some (not all) fossil fuel companies will pay (e.g. Spamming social media with fake information) in order to try and maintain their dominant market position is also vast!. <br /><br />Massive problems can be broken down into smaller steps as a way to make them more manageable. Below are a few ways anyone can begin to be &#39;part of the solution&#39; in mitigating human caused climate change (inc improving your immediate local environments).<br /><br />1. Think of ways you can reduce your Carbon footprint that benefit your health and the planet. e.g., Cycle rather than drive (And get those politicians to invest in good/safe cycle networks. e.g. I use an electric bike, where practical, that&#39;s charged by solar panels (or it could be charged via a home green energy provider).<br /><br />2. Reduce your Plastic waste (and get those politicians to incentivise manufacturers too also). Turning the ocean (climate regulator) into a plastic soup will only worsen our environmental problems.<br /><br />3. Choose green energy providers and “chat” (take peaceful action if they can’t/ refuse to understand) to those politicians to invest in green energy deals &amp; quit burning fossil fuels.<br /><br />4. Reduce your Air Travel. Electric Jets maybe on the horizon. But until then, flying by Jet planes are a serous contributor to CO2 commissions in the atmosphere. e.g. Do you really need to fly to a business conference every year when in fact it could be an online conference &amp; maybe a face to face conference every third year, for one example out of so many where improvments need to be made?. <br /><br />5. Eat less meat &amp; dairy products. Meat is very energy intensive compared to Plants (inc fungi, nuts,pulses etc). Generally speaking, a whole grain (less processed) plant based diet is a healthier option and can provide all the substance your body will ever need. <br /><br />6. A manageable size family. If every couple whom wanted children had no more than two kiddies then the human population explosion would be sustainable (provided we learned to live sustainably).<br /><br />7. Learn more about the ecosystem you live in (More environmentally aware humans is the answer to cultures of people behaving in environmentally destructive ways). <br /><br />8. Join movements (or/and donate to organisations) that seek to mitigate extinction rates. Species are dying out due to human activity! (e.g. Deforestation &amp; land change use). Help save them!.<br /><br />In summary: The general degradation of the planets ecosystems due to human activities are &quot;reversible&quot; (can be improved upon by reducing/reversing the destructive behaviour).

This will work as vulcano ash. Vulcano ash have cooled down the earth, for example in 1850, when a vulcano sank the average temperature on earth by 2 degrees. This is only a solution, but it cost billions. But.... if the vulcano cooled down the earth 70 years before the idustrial revolution, and the average temperature starts to raise up again (as it has done for its whole existance, warming up after the ice age and cooling down to create the ice age). Maybe it is natural? We dont know. And also.... CO2 have only been researched in small places where the ocean and stuff like that wasnt counter in. We dont know if the ocean reduces the impact of the co2 or tripples it. Also: north pole is shrinking, but the south pole is growing. If the temperature melts siberia and greenland, then we will get more trees which will reduce the CO2. Greenland was once green, because the name was given to the country by the vikings.

Sea level has been rising since the last ice age, which ended approximately 12,000 years ago. Okay, The CO2 in the atmosphere can only absorb infrared radiation in a 15 micron wave length, very small amount. The CO2 currently in the atmosphere is already at 90% saturation for the amount of heat it can absorb. If the 400 ppm CO2 currently in the atmosphere is responsible for a .5 degree C increase in global temperature, CO2 would have to increase to 800 ppm for this to account for a 1 degree C increase in temperature. The effect of CO2 does not have a linear effect on temperature, it is logarithmic meaning for the temperature to increase one more degree the CO2 levels would have to increase to 1600 ppm. For the temp to rise the predicted 4 degrees C the CO2 levels would have to reach 6400 ppm. The ice core records plainly show that CO2 levels have risen as a result of temperature change and have a 300 to 800 year lag behind the temperature rise. Furthermore the cores recovered from the ocean floor indicated that after temperatures rose it caused a mass die off of zooplankton which in turn released huge amounts of CO2 into the ocean which out gassed to the atmosphere over a very long period. This would account for the lag from temperature rise to CO2 levels increasing. My problem with CO2 being such a huge problem come from the fact that CO2 is such an insignificant part of our atmosphere. Nitrogen accounts for 78% of the atmosphere, oxygen 21% and argon 0.9%. Gases like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, and ozone are trace gases that account for about a tenth of one percent of the atmosphere.  Co2 accounts for slightly less than .04% of the total atmosphere.  If you account for all of the natural CO2 being released into the atmosphere by vegetative decay, limestone weathering, oceanic out gassing etc...  Human emitted CO2 only accounts for approximately 3 % of total CO2 emissions.  Like I said, junk science, because science by consensus is not science. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViY2J3LPgN4"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViY2J3LPgN4</a>",UCJTzFEuOsq0C2Q6jKjHX4vw,0,UgzqwOZt09lIG9xro1l4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

As for global warming, humanity thrives in global warming and perishes in global cooling (there is no New York, or Seattle, or Chicago, or Boston, or Paris, or London in global cooling and all of Canada is ice-buried or glacier-scraped off the planet). As for carbon emissions, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is essential for plant life and only begins to become toxic for humans at 5,000-7,000 PPM. We&#39;re now only at 400 PPM (approximately fifteen times BELOW toxic levels), finally reversing Earth&#39;s 800,000 year downward trend toward plant-life&#39;s collapse at 30 PPM (if the 800,000-years steady decline in atmospheric CO2 had collapsed to 30 PPM, all plant-eating animal life on Earth would have gone extinct). Other data clearly shows that the planet Earth is now &#39;greening&#39; from the 200-year increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from 300 PPM to today&#39;s 400 PPM. As plants in the modern era increasingly green the planet (the Amazon rain forest is currently greening faster than deforestation), animal life benefits from eating so many stronger, healthier green plants. The plants are currently &#39;feasting&#39; on the atmospheric increase of carbon dioxide and the animals will &#39;feast&#39; on the oxygen that so many more plants exhale after inhaling the carbon dioxide.

The temperature increases in the atmosphere is statistically insignificant. Still getting hotter, but on average not the weather we would normally notice. <br />The other issue is the temperature measurement. There has been a significant change in the way we measure temperatures. Today its automatic, while in the near past it was by human observation. The issue with this is that earlier temperature reading are being modified to account for this change is measuring method, normally being adjusted downward. This is based on assumptions, which is a risky thing to do when the deltas we are talking about are so small. Tracking the temperature changes in the last 20 years is reasonable, because the method of measurement has remained constant. But anything before requires assumptions, and when you introduce assumption you introduce margins of errors. Using the earlier data can result in the margin of error being greater than the change in temperature. While there are lies, damn lies and statistics, when the statistic is simple, transparent and directly relates to the point you are making, the truth can be uncovered. Note: transparent means avoiding assumptions.<br />In the last 20 years temperature did rise, but is currently dropping slightly – I think in the last 2 years.

Apparently, we are in a mini ice-age and temperatures have been rising for the past approximately, seven thousand years and that the trend will continue for the next three thousand years, after which the cycle will reverse and the earth will begin to cool for the following ten thousand years, after which time, the cycle will reverse and the climate will once again begin to warm.<br /><br />Those who push the claim that climate change is man-made, argue that it is &#39;the oil industry&#39; that denies climate change. The climate change industry provides massive profits for the same bankers, financiers and investors who invest in oil.<br /><br />The industrial revolution started in about 1760, but didn&#39;t get fully underway until 1840. That is eight to ten generations since the gears of the industrial revolution, slowly started to grind.<br /><br />Humans are at the very beginning of the technological revolution that will profoundly affect humans in ways that we cannot comprehend. Everything is about to change either for better or worse. Take your pick: Aldus Huxley&#39;s &#39;Brave New World&#39; or George Owell&#39;s &#39;1984&#39;.<br /><br />The scientists and technologists; the banks, financiers, corporations, investors and governments that support them, view the future, not in tens of generations, nor in hundreds of generation, but in thousands and tens of thousands of generations.<br /><br />Exploitation of ALL of the Earth&#39;s energy resources, are the only way that humans will survive.<br /><br />Professor Michio Kaku has said that it will take a minimum of one hundred years (four generations), for humanity to achieve such a degree of technological advancement, that they gain level one on the Kardashev scale of advanced civilisations.<br /><br />The optimum human population to achieve level one, is about one billion people, so depopulation of the earth will have to be rapid. There is evidence that actions to depopulate the earth have already begun.<br /><br />Prof. Kaku predicts it will take a further one million years to achieve level two on the Kardashev scale. One million years is equivalent to 40,000 generations.<br /><br />To finally quote Prof. Kaku &#39;It is so important for humanity to achieve the status of a level one civilisation, that any obstacle should be seen seen as a terrorist threat!&#39;<br /><br />Is global warming caused by the actions of humanity? There is not enough evidence. There are valid arguments on both sides.<br /><br />Climate change is a reality. The earth is warming! Is humanity responsible?<br /><br />Whether humanity is responsible or not for climate change, it is a very convenient time to start conserving the remaining organic energy resources and to develop new ways of harnessing alternative sources for the use of those chosen to have their descendants explore and exploit the earth, the solar system and possibly nearby stars for the next 40,000 generations.",UC-lMtNAXqvrQCZ0mqFGXRjA,0,UgyBqjaGrefxpqDLZqp4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

According to predictions, that reaction will cause the temperature to continue to rise by several degrees in the next century.

Sure I don't disagree that we have some effect but to what amount? it surely is less than 10%. To really understand this we need to also understand the end of the last ice age which may have ended abruptly and much more suddenly than we once thought. There is evidence of impacts over the North American Ice Cap near the end of the ice age. This would have caused a mass melting of ice which would leave us with a huge amount of unnaturally melted ice according to our current and past melting cycles. This could play a major role now.

I do not intend to be confrontational but it bothers me, as perhaps I have somewhat of a obsessive compulsive thing that demands order. I believe my statement was I will endeavor to be very brief. I'm not going to write a paragraph on the difference as I'm quite certain, the need to feed your curiosity, the need that brought you to this page demonstrates a certain degree of awareness. And I also didn't expound so much on the warming of our environment as much as how we propose to mitigate the ""imagined"" effects. I say imagined as we really don't know what is causing it and therefore don't understand its behavior, long or short term. In the short term the reaction might be clear enough but what is the cause. Volcanism, The Antarctic is teaming with fissures. Vapors / gasses in the atmosphere? Solar events, or are we moving through a more energetic area of our orbit, our galaxy? I find it odd several other planets in our solar system are also warming. I find it confusing the Antarctic volcanoes are behaving like a water heater, melting fresh water and disturbing the Global Ocean Conveyor Belt. Which can affect weather and so on. Or gasses in the atmosphere is also a potential problem. AND, what is Nibiru? Real, legend or history, imagined? Toss all that aside briefly and evaluate the people of this planet and those that govern them and now those that influence the governments. Could there be a group of people that consider themselves to be a higher order of people a civilization of a purer blood line meant to rule? This is Twilight Zone stuff here. If there were would they keep us in a constant state of war, civil unrest, how far would they go? What is their goal? Would you believe them if they showed pictures graphs charts and had people to testify.....Give us 100 trillion dollars or be ready to suffer and your children will die. Why the push, why the urgency? What do they, (those that somehow rose to royalty like status.) What do they know. Underground bunkers, Secret industrial complexes, CIA buys up new tech patents regarding energy and matter manipulation. Some 5000 patents. Rumors of a developed space program and travel amongst the stars with trade and research with other entities. I don't know anything, I don't understand anything. But I seem to be relatively aware there is much more to be known, much more to be aware of and one day the veil will be lifted. Soooo. What is a Skweb? Is it really magical?

I could write a book on the things swirling around in my head on this topic but I'm going to endeavor to be VERY brief. I'll touch on topics not covered in the video, and reference all further considerations to the video attached, of which I was very fortunate to find a recent and updated version. We (everyone) has valuable opinions, therefore I will not deprive you of your rights or belittle your thought process, you have obviously spent a lot of time researching and formulating the processes by which your beliefs are formed. Of all the facts and beliefs that form my opinions one action for mitigating the effects I loosely agree with is the alternate clean energy source of the future. As in the days of old when the pollution generated by our primary energy was in the form of that left by the horses on the streets, and the solution was simply more street sweepers. Much the same today as we grapple with cleaning up after our energy producers we try to fix it with todays technology. Simply adding more cost to fixing an obsolete or inefficient technology. Reference the Green New Deal, If for example we ground all aircraft and build new transit what will be the net effect if the rest of the world picks up the demand for world travel. Then in 30 years some genius creates a Star Trek like transporter. Or as in the case of India who is pro environment if someone else pays for it. Trillions could be spent today in what will certainly bankrupt the U.S. for decades depriving future generations of the resources for advancement in other sectors. While I believe WITHOUT BASIS, only faith that our technology in energy will change drastically with breakthroughs in Thorium, Zero Point, Fusion or even Anti Matter. What will the future be without the budget or resources to implement these if we mortgage our descendants today on ""street sweepers"". And of course very little of this matters without the co-operation of the world. If I'm wrong.....we may go down in flames by 2100, but I believe with all my heart, great things are just around the corner and without panic we have plenty of time to act wisely. Therefore the value of my opinion plus the price of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, ""WILL GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE AT Starbucks""!!! It is as valuable to me as yours to you. If you and I stood before congress for funding with our charts, graphs and experts the winner of funding the worlds energy problems would go to those that made the highest contributions to the economy, the decision makers and their private interests all in the name of the future for our children.

Im pretty sure by themselves the ocean emitted around 780 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere per year, but the atmosphere emitted it back to the ocean. However, ever since we started emitting CO2, around 20-30 gigaatons a year, it threw off the balance. The surface was emitting 20-30 more megatons a year than the atmosphere, which meant the atmosphere would have more greenhouse gases, which meant infrared radiation would be trapped in. Water vapor was not really a problem because the ocean/land and the atmosphere were emitting equal amounts to each other, and it was balanced until we started emitting more co2.

About the cataclysms they recorded in great detail. The Sumerians & Sichens translations of Annunaki, Nibiru, Wormwoods etc. All of those events were continually recorded any chance the ancients had. In caves drawings, Clay tablets, Historical accounts etc. It all has a somewhat repeating pattern. The detail in which these planets were described was thorough to say the least. I wasn't sure about all that. As I typically don't believe anything that comes from man. But as the months rolled on I started to witness these warning signs. Started watching the sun & the suns flares/glares. Studying the colors & the objects that can be seen inside them moving. As time went on those glares became bigger more defined. Then on day I started catching little things around the suns rim. More time, those objects grew in size & definition. Today I'm taking photos almost every day of these incoming planets. The sizes, colors, number of moons etc all matches biblical & ancient descriptions to the T. We can look at the past decade & see how everything has started to increase. Volcanic activity, seismic, world wide weather events, record temperatures continually beat by new records, back to back 100 year storm events, weather events never seen or recorded by modern man, every planet in the solar system including our sun is being affected by something, Magnetic poles moving so fast governments around the world had to update GPS maps years early, Insane electrical discharges worldwide, Earths electrical discharges occurring daily now, Governments building ghost cities & running cataclysm drills, increased meteor bombardments, The ice caps are literally sliding off into the ocean. Yet gaining ice on the surface. All these mixed with ancient accounts, biblical accounts, my own research as well as others, my photos as well as others etc... It's all adding up to one conclusion. It's that time of the millenium for mother Earth to go through one of its dramatic changes. We have the Taurid meteor swarm approaching in front of the sun again, Jupiter & Saturn coming in on closest approach to Earth. Plus all the new bodies on the way up & out on there huge elliptical orbit. I'm not scientist or expert & I don't know everything. Only what I've researched, witnessed & recorded.

Of the 0.04% Carbon dioxide 96% of the 0.04% is natural ie: comes from the ocean and volcano&#39;s. We humans contribute 4% of the 0.04% of carbon dioxide. Please think about that before you vote in a new tax we don&#39;t need. <br /><br />Climate change It&#39;s called &quot;WEATHER&quot; and yes weather changes. And guess what people? the weather has been changing for millions of years.<br /><br />And Co2 is not bad for the planet. Plants depend on, and even thrive on levels of about 400 parts per million and above, were are at about 400 parts per million. So stop bullshit and fear mongering.CO2 concentration in ambient air ranges from 300-500 parts per million (ppm), with a global atmospheric average of about 400 ppm. If you are growing in a greenhouse or indoors, the CO2 levels will be reduced as the plants use it up during photosynthesis.<br /><br />The IPCC STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(UN IPCC) is misleading humanity about climate change and sea levels, a leading expert on sea levels who served on the UN IPCC told The New American. In fact, it is more likely that sea levels will decline, not rise, explained Dr Nils-Axel Mörner, the retired head of the paleogeophysics and geodynamics at Stockholm University. A new solar-driven cooling period is not far off, he said. But when Mörner tried to warn the UN IPCC that it was publishing false information that would inevitably be discredited, they simply ignored him. And so, dismayed, he resigned in disgust and decided to blow the whistle. <br /><br />Asked if coastal cities such as Miami would be flooding due to sea-level rise caused by alleged man-made global warming, Mörner was unequivocal: “Absolutely not.” “There is no rapid sea-level rise going on today, and there will not be,” he said, citing observable data. “On the contrary, if anything happens, the sea will go down a little.” The widely respected scientist, who has been tracking sea levels in various parts of the globe for some 50 years, blasted those who use incorrect “correction factors” in their data to make it appear that seas are rising worldwide. That is just wrong, he saiseriously scary fact is there are people among us who share the same views as this inept fool. <br /><br />If climate change is real, it is the greatest thing to happen to the planet. For e.g Higher Co2 levels Increased the world&#39;s crops and harvest more food. Australian Decrease in cyclones this year is only seven, the average is thirteen. <br />Atlantic hurricanes recorded in 2018 was three, the annual average is seven. <br />Global greening, tree coverage, grasslands and have increased. Coral reefs are starting to replenish themselves.<br /><br />Antarctic ice is now thicker. The latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent since 2012. <br /><br />[The Danish Polar Portal reports that]: If we rank the annual surface mass balance since 1981 from low to high, the lowest on record was 2011-2012 (38 Gt) and this year is the 5th highest out of the 37-year record.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s gone from Global Warming which was a lie to Climate change more lies.<br />Climate change is a multi-Billion dollar a year industry. <br />Wake up people do your homework. <br /><br />Can anyone please tell me?<br />WHAT ACTUAL FACTS THERE ARE TO PROVE <br />CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSED BY MAN, Anyone?<br /><br />About Climate Change<br />Just some information and some sites that I have put together. <br /><br />Dr Patrick Moore one of the founders of Green peace. <br /><a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2kIcFIofUHkhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oYhCQv5tNsQ"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2kIcFIofUHkhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oYhCQv5tNsQ</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.technocracy.news/former-president-of-greenpeace-scientifically-rips-climate-change-to-shreds/"">https://www.technocracy.news/former-president-of-greenpeace-scientifically-rips-climate-change-to-shreds/</a><br /><br />Climate Science and the Myths of Renewable Energy - FOS Steve Goreham<br /><a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mtHreJbr2WM"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mtHreJbr2WM</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxI3doCKhI7Q&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_yYz7n9zgAhWIf30KHbq0AZQQtwIwAHoECAcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kywGwd-uJs97PD6QbOXiG"">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxI3doCKhI7Q&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_yYz7n9zgAhWIf30KHbq0AZQQtwIwAHoECAcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kywGwd-uJs97PD6QbOXiG</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/09/28/nasa-the-chill-of-solar-minimum-is-being-felt-in-our-atmosphere-cooling-trend-seen"">https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/09/28/nasa-the-chill-of-solar-minimum-is-being-felt-in-our-atmosphere-cooling-trend-seen</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientists_who_disagree_with_the_scientific_consensus_on_global_warming"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientists_who_disagree_with_the_scientific_consensus_on_global_warming</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://skepticalscience.com/sea-level-not-rising.htm"">https://skepticalscience.com/sea-level-not-rising.htm</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/tree-cover-increase-world-deforestation-farming-rainforests-forests-a8486096.html"">https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/tree-cover-increase-world-deforestation-farming-rainforests-forests-a8486096.html</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://principia-scientific.org/father-of-global-warming-scientist-finally-admits-theory-is-wrong/?fbclid=IwAR36byzZU862Tt-4yUodSMvG15EFq4kLV1UxT6Rm48cbW9k6K71N7t7dkY8"">https://principia-scientific.org/father-of-global-warming-scientist-finally-admits-theory-is-wrong/?fbclid=IwAR36byzZU862Tt-4yUodSMvG15EFq4kLV1UxT6Rm48cbW9k6K71N7t7dkY8</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://humansarefree.com/2016/04/top-scientist-resigns-global-warming-is.html?m=0&amp;utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork"">http://humansarefree.com/2016/04/top-scientist-resigns-global-warming-is.html?m=0&amp;utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/02/whistle-blower-scientist-exposes-shoddy-climate-science-noaa/"">https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/02/whistle-blower-scientist-exposes-shoddy-climate-science-noaa/</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://m.phys.org/news/2013-07-greening-co2.html"">https://m.phys.org/news/2013-07-greening-co2.html</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=3"">https://friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=3</a><br /><br />Professor Bob Carter on Global Warming Science.

The fog blocked the sun during the day, causing temperatures to drop, crops to fail and people to die. A volcanic eruption in Iceland in early 536 helped spread ash across the Northern Hemisphere, creating the fog. this eruption was big enough to alter global climate patterns, causing years of famine. The effects of the 536 eruption were compounded by eruptions in 540 and 547, and it took a long time for the Northern Hemisphere to recover. The Late Antique Little Ice Age that began in the spring of 536 lasted in western Europe until about 660, and it lasted until about 680 in Central Asia. <br /><br /><br />In North America, between AD 1276 and AD 1299, occurred what is called the Great Drought. The Great Drought was but one of several major periods of drought that have affected the same region in the past three millennia. The region affected by the Great Drought encompassed the area that extended from what is now Oregon to southern California and east to what is now eastern Texas.<br /><br /><br />Severe climate and weather changes have occurred throughout the Earth&#39;s history and 99.9% of it had nothing to do with human activity. Is the current change in climate and/or weather the result of human activity? I think we contribute to climate change, I don&#39;t think we are the creators of it. Nothing we have done, so far, has come close to what the Earth has already experienced. That doesn&#39;t mean that if we continue to pollute this planet at the rate we are now doing it, that there won&#39;t be severe consequences in the future. I believe we are tasked to be wise stewards of our planet and if we are aren&#39;t, then we will definitely reap the seeds, in sorrow, that we&#39;ve sown.<br /><br /><br /><br />Information source: Britannica and <a href=""http://history.com/"">History.com</a>",UCWQ0gR9J-Dh_yJDz2nQ1oHQ,0,UgwmvCalxNKsPwaZipt4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The TL;DR is 'we could have experienced more sea level rise than we did'. The key to the confusion may be the definition of the word 'mitigate'; it doesn't mean ""cancel out"" in this case.  Imagine you are riding your bike downhill, picking up speed rapidly. Moderately applying the break will mitigate your downward acceleration, but it won't cause you to reverse back up the hill. Here's what the article--your source--actually says. ""A new NASA-led study has determined that an increase in snowfall accumulation over Antarctica during the 20th century mitigated sea level rise by 0.4 inches. However, Antarctica’s additional ice mass gained from snowfall makes up for just about a third of its current ice loss. “Our findings don’t mean that Antarctica is growing; it’s still losing mass, even with the extra snowfall,” said Brooke Medley, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published in Nature Climate Change on Dec. 10. “What it means, however, is that without these gains, we would have experienced even more sea level rise in the 20th century.” The polar ice sheets grow via snow accumulation and shrink through melting and the production of icebergs. Presently, both ice sheets are imbalanced –losing more ice annually than they are gaining– and their ice loss is estimated to be currently causing about a half of the observed sea level rise. Sea level adjusts to changes in snowfall, which modulates how much water is locked into the ice sheets.""",UCHCV8kosxW1miEadfE5SAJQ,1,Ugz6ayW-uFFkcu4scWZ4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

We are also still in the Ice Age, we are just inside a temporary interglacial which is expected to end in somewhere between a couple of thousand years and 40,000 years from now.

Also, if you read the literature you'll find that plants prior to the 20th Century were showing signs of CO2 starvation, at around 180 ppm - 200 ppm photosynthesis shuts down.

The earth itself makes a LOT of heat from the interior. The earth is also growing by gathering dust from space. The earth produces large quantities of methane (natural gas which is 20 times more effective at producing global warming than CO2.) from organic matter and moisture. Always has; always will. A large portion of the heat from the earth is released into space by radiant heat. CO2 is assimilated by plants, oceans, and ends up as limestone (CaCO3), which is the bodily remains of small marine creatures. The earth has a balance system for C02, no matter where it comes from. Increased C02 increases plant growth, which uses more C02, reducing the levels in air. C02 is absorbed by rain. . I think the effect of mankind on C02 levels is minimal at worst, and of no effect at best. We have contaminated our fresh water sources, which is a real problem.

It is a little known fact that mammoths are not extinct, They are in fact quite abundant. People don’t realise that the mammoth is a burrowing animal, a mole like creature, that uses its tusks to shift dirt aside as it happily tunnels under the Siberian tundra. Global warming has had the positive effect of warming the tundra allowing the mammoth to extend its range and its population. I know anyone reading this will be sceptical. What about the frozen mammoths and what about the bones they will cry. Well you doubters mammoths are ideally suited to the warm dry underground of the tundra and their physiology has evolved accordingly, however, when they are exposed to fresh air they snap freeze immediately which explains the carcasses that are sometimes found. As for all of the skeletons, well their meat is so delicious that Siberian hunters roam the tundra searching for the beasts and upon finding a snap frozen carcass quickly strip it and sell it to Russian oligarchs. The meat is usually cooked with garlic and mares milk. The left over offal and meat is of course quickly consumed by Dire Wolves, Short Faced Bears and Sabre Toothed Cats.

Scientists were honest that they felt the data had holes, and that the holes meant that temperatures did not seem to be rising as the model predicted. They tried to fill those holes and were accused of fiddling the data. Then, in 2015 the hiatus ended with rapid temperature growth, clear evidence over many different studies (and there are a lot).

When I look at fact checkers, I see constant labelling of these articles as misleading. When I look at the simple facts of what we are doing (pulling fossil fuels out of the ground and burning them wastefully) the truth becomes obvious. Now I will point to an earlier comment ""it's easy to fool someone, nearly impossible to make them realise that they've been fooled."". I would never call a climate denier a fool.

I know that the green city projects around the world are tackling these issues and adopting tactics and strategies of naturally occuring systems of climate science and maintaining the localised rainfall in the cities so utilising convection currents to help cool the city and maintain the water cycle and also as a natural filtration of pollutants in the air while adopting new technologies in efficient building designs and sustainable strategies in energy collection and distribution that have been developed in the 20th and 21st centuries.<br /><br />But that being said you and everyone else for that matter have never mentioned a few major contributing factor at play, like the polar reversal of the earth and the systemic processes going on below our feet and how it affects the water on, in and above the earth and within our atmosphere not to mention the reduced protection from space weather on certain areas of the globe due to weak spots in our magnetosphere (eg. above Brazil) and also our solar systems orbit through our galaxy where we are moving out of an area of protection, that in layman&#39;s terms it is like moving out of cloud cover and exposing the earth to greater amounts of space weather.<br />What we have to appreciate is that the arc of time that humans have occupied on earth is not long enough to collate the data required even if we had the science and technologies right at the beginning and is inconsequential if we had data spanning the last 10000, 20000 or even 100000 years, because for this greater arc of time we would need data covering the last million years to have the resolution necessary to correctly understand what is truly going on. So, do our perceptions demonstrate the aspects of this greater arc of time...rhetorical, no and as always the intellectual community and scientists have over simplified the complexity of these contributing factors. I am very disappointed in the short sightedness and blindness of our current models to consider these major aspects and possibly greater ones that I have not considered. So all I have to say is climate change is real but not limited to the archaic and over simplified perceptions we have accepted, it often makes me think that it is possibly due to the aspect of the conversation that these bigger perceptions would introduce, painting a bleak outlook of the future of our planet and ultimately prove how we have less control on what can be done to combat the inherent challenges of a model like this poses for all life on this planet. I can see how that reality is not acceptable for the status quo of our global economy and social stability. I just hope by the time we realise that it isn&#39;t too late to implement changes to our lives to survive the reality it will impose on us. I hope this is understood, my intention is not to fear monger but to have a deeper look at the greater aspects of reality. Thanks for sharing and making it possible for us to have this discussion in a place that reaches the public eye that forums on this subject just do not reach or include the greater community. /respect",UC-JmLtYUkn2WFL5KmsRg3kA,0,UgzAHm23TXrDdq3KNEp4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Clearly we have evolved uniquely, but what is it about humans that put themselves on a pedestal? Are we not animals like all the rest or are we? Sentience is not unique to humans, nor any other trait (that aware I'm aware of), so my question is, if we are results of nature, how can we be considered unnatural? As for affecting climate change, my only point is that it ultimately will be a cause of morality, and I personally believe it is a moral cause to save humanity if it as stake, although im not quite ready to heap all the blame on humans and, if I were, would not readily suggest the cause and effect of such an event unnatural -regardless of mode or means. As a side note humans have undoubtedly had a dramatic effect on the planet due to overstated reasons mostly our rapid advancement. As such I believe it is our ""moral"" obligation to take care of our home. One could reason that if given the unique advantage to see where potential problems to survive is threatened (unlike dinosaurs for example) we should definitely use it and why wouldn't we, survival is, was, and will always be the name of the game as across all species, it's why we're alive today.",UC7WfsfJSVLJgGooLoR1gAAw,1,Ugx7x7rPjVaSyoxu0gV4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Most of the known universe is inhospitable towards life as we know it (though I suppose we will discover life in the universe is plentiful). I feel saving or destroying the habitability of earth comes to a moral decision. Nature itself is excluded from ""right or wrong,"" but as a state of being or condtion should be indifferent whether humans live or die, it will continue as before. All this is conjecture of course. It's interesting question though. If life unexpectedly evolved to create an entity which would otherwise produce it's own demise it must be considered natural because all nature is a series of ""unexpected"" outcomes due to random chance.

Yes there are very long term carbon cycles but we know that has varied from a maximum of about 8000 ppm to a low of about 180 ppm. If left alone it is quite conceivable that the atmospheric and oceanic carbon dioxide would detrimentally become entombed in minerals to the point all life on earth would cease to exist. 150 ppm is the level set for life extinction as photosynthesis at this level is too difficult under current conditions on Earth. In the past fortuitous events (volcanism, earthquakes, peat fires set by lightning, etc) have rejuvenated enough entombed carbon to resuscitate bleak periods of waning life on Earth. Today we are no where near as bio-diverse as we should be and far too much of the Earth is covered by largely lifeless desert (and oceanic deserts too.) The Sahara alone is far larger than the USA and it used to be rich green forest. This is a tragedy that can be alleviated once we get CO2 levels optimized for life on Earth. The one thing we know for certain is that CO2 has little to no effect on climate owing to its minuscule quantities thus bearing little to no physical influence on the Earth's electromagnetic radiation budgets. We know this because there is no linkage between much higher (20 times higher) CO2 concentrations to very low CO2 concentrations (less than 1/2 of today's) and wildly divergent climate and temperature during both extremes. Your first erroneous assumption is that some idea of a natural stasis is a worthy ideal or goal. Nature itself rejects this concept and we must do so also. We must instead ""bio form"" the Earth to make it more suitable for all, not just western elites who have the luxury of keeping their own little universes immune from alteration. (The modern college campus is a prime example of this) A much richer CO2 environment means more fish in the seas and more life in the deserts. Neither the seas nor the surface is ""out of room"" for more life. They are rather out of CO2 for more life. Are you aware that surface plants require far less water to thrive in a more CO2 rich atmosphere? Are you also aware that the most prolific waters of the oceans are in the highest latitudes solely because colder waters hold far more CO2 to support all life, both animal and plant, as the food base of all of oceanic biological activity? Do the low latitude waters really need to be so lifeless? Who or what does this benefit? Try not to be closed minded on this, I fear you have been well-educated and that is a terrible thing to do to an otherwise healthy mind.",UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA,1,Ugx7x7rPjVaSyoxu0gV4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Those were the years we passed the Clean Air Act and then amended it to add new regulations. One of the amendments required industry to place scrubbers on their smokestacks in order to mitigate acid rain. Industry did just that. That's why we no longer have an acid rain problem. Acid rain did not go away on its own. In 1990 we banned CFCs, which is why the ozone hole has been mending. Nobody made up anything about these environmental problems. They don't exist now precisely because we took action. No scientist anywhere on this planet predicted a worldwide flood. None. Nada. Zip. Even when they were drunk. You're scoffing at misinformation. The actual predictions scientists have made have indeed come true. Here they are: 19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record. Record warm temperatures are now outpacing record cold ones by a 1.7 to 1 ratio. The oceans are the warmest ever recorded. The heatwave that affected 17 countries in 2018 was the largest heat event in recorded history. Average winter temperature in Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska has risen an astonishing 8 degrees F since mid 20th century. The Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are melting at rates unprecedented in recorded history. Sea level rise throughout most of the 20th century hovered around 1.5mm per year. In the 1990s it rose to 3mm per year. From 2013-2018 it reached 5mm per year. In 2019: 6mm per year. Source: the World Meteorological Organization, NASA and European satellite altimeter data and worldwide tide gauges. In the last 20 years, high tide flooding along the U.S. northeast has risen 140%, according to NOAA. It has risen 190% along the southeast. According to the EPA, extreme precipitation events in the American northeast has risen over 50% since 1960. They're up 30-40% in the south, nidwest and northern plains. These events are up around the world. Category 1 and 2 hurricanes are decreasing while category 4 and 5s are increasing, according to NOAA. The number of natural disasters in the past 20 years has nearly doubled, according to a new UN report released last month.

This means the snow flakes intermingle for up to 36 years before migrating into a porous (un-isolated) firn. The depth of the antarctic firn runs anywhere from an estimated 100 meters in the polar regions. The rough firn close off date is estimated to be approximately 2000 years ago. With this in mind, I would demand of anyone proffering evidence based on the isotopic legacy of some evaporated water molecules finding themselves in the windswept antarctic snowflakes that gives ""scientists"" the ability to distinguish those whose water molecules somehow 'collectively' evaporated in 1880 vs those of 1881. I would ask what the temperature and of the sea and air including air pressure was at the precise moment the molecules evaporation occurred and the path each molecule path took before finding themselves being dug up from a glacial firn. In other words I would stop the bullshit in its tracks.

Enough measuring stations were in place around the world in 1880 to calculate global average temperature. Climate scientists agree on that. You don't need to measure every dell and hilltop to come up with averages. Nor do you need to measure every isolated region. NOAA will supply you with the explanations for how it's done. The warming trend is seen in urban measurements stations, rural stations, in the middle of the ocean, and in isolated regions like northern Canada and the Arctic, with no human activity around. It's also seen from satellites through measurement of radiance. Antarctic temperatures dating back thousands of years can be calculated by isotopic measurements from ice cores. Water is made up of molecules comprising two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen (H2O). But it's not that simple, because there are several isotopes (chemically identical atoms with the same number of protons, but differing numbers of neutrons, and therefore mass) of oxygen, and several isotopes of hydrogen. The isotopes of particular interest for climate studies are 16O (with 8 protons and 8 neutrons that makes up 99.76 percent of the oxygen in water) and 18O (8 protons and 10 neutrons), together with 1H (with one proton and no neutrons, which is 99.985 percent of the hydrogen in water) and 2H (also known as deuterium (D), which has one proton and one neutron). All of these isotopes are termed 'stable' because they do not undergo radioactive decay. Using sensitive mass spectrometers, researchers are able to measure the ratio of the isotopes of both oxygen and hydrogen in samples taken from ice cores, and compare the result with the isotopic ratio of an average ocean water standard known as SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Water). The water molecules in ice cores are always depleted in the heavier isotopes (that is, the isotopes with the larger number of neutrons) and the difference compared to the standard is expressed as either 18O or D. Both of these values tell essentially the same story--namely, that there is less 18O and D during cold periods than there is in warm. Why is this? Simply put, it takes more energy to evaporate the water molecules containing a heavy isotope from the surface of the ocean, and, as the moist air is transported polewards and cools, the water molecules containing heavier isotopes are preferentially lost in precipitation. Both of these processes, known as fractionation, are temperature dependent. At a range of sites in the polar regions scientists have measured a near linear relationship between 18O and D in samples of modern snowfall taken over several years and the mean annual temperature. This relationship can be used to calibrate the isotope ratio thermometer, although the calibration changes a little during ice age climates. Plotting either 18O or D with depth along the length of an ice core reveals the seasonal oscillations in temperature and researchers can also count annual layers in order to date them. From the very deepest ice cores reaching depths of more than three kilometers in the Antarctic ice sheet, we can clearly see the steady pulsing of the ice ages on a period of about 100,000 years. From a site called Dome C in Antarctica, we have recently reconstructed the climate spanning the last three quarters of a million years, and have shown seven ice ages, each interspersed with a warm interglacial climate such as the one we are living in today. As I mentioned, NOAA provides full explanations of how they and the world's other climate centers calculate global averages. I would highly recommend visiting one of their sites and educating yourself before calling other people fools and assuming PhD-level scientists are somehow dumber than you.",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1,UgwF_DNkD3zSbk6nupp4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

In my opinion this is how the power brokers are trying to steal all of our freedoms for the supposed good of humanity . When they gobble up precious fossil fuels and act as they though now they are continuing the hoax . Let me share something that the US government did to its citizens . In 1973 they claimed we only had 12 years of oil left underground in this country meaning by 1985 we should have run out . In those 12 years we had 100 million new americans but we still had fuel now 45 years later we are sitting on the largest supply of fossil fuel ever . So history tells me that when these folks lie about 12 years before catastrophe I fail to react emotionally . Lets focus on the oceans and cleaning the garbage out of them . That is something that is much more important and again if I am wrong do you think that if man is the cause then the planet should remove us from living on its surface .

Those who reside in the cities live a Much more progressive life than the vast majority of the population. So you are referring to a tiny % of the population who ‘own’ businesses. Even so, they are tightly controlled and are basically the ‘share croppers’ of the City. Right now, Hong Kong is terrified and fighting against the Mainland attempting to extradite them. I guess you romanticize Communism, wherein people ‘disappear’ for making statements which are not sanctioned. My point re: plastic, (since you missed it), the MANUFACTURE of plastics is dirty business. In fact, since the late 1800’s, it is manufacturing alone, NOT CARS, that produced the bulk of Co2 and legitimate pollutants worldwide. Do you think electric cars are ‘clean’? It takes fossil fuel, Co2 emission, to generate electricity. Solar and wind produce approx. 3% of energy...that’s it! Co2 production, at its height, had/has very little to do with cars....in case you missed it Again. And AGAIN, China, India, South America, etc will continue to produce the BULK of Co2, regardless of what happens in other countries. And Again, Co2 is a harmless gas, required for the earth to flourish. The is ZERO evidence it ‘traps’ heat to begin with.

No scientist in climatology ever said the ice sheets would be completely melted by 2020. That process will take thousands of years. But at over 400 ppm and rising, CO2 will soon reach the same level it was in the dinosaur age, raising temperatures so high that ALL of the ice sheets will indeed melt, just as they did in prehistoric times, causing a massive flood which will cover both Canada and the United States with a 1000-foot-deep ocean.

In the U.S., the Midwest and Northeast have seen the strongest increases in heavy precipitation events. Scientists expect these trends to continue as the planet continues to warm. Warmer air can hold more water vapor. For each degree of warming, the air’s capacity for water vapor goes up by about 7 percent. An atmosphere with more moisture can produce more intense precipitation events, which is exactly what has been observed. Increases in heavy precipitation may not always lead to an increase in total precipitation over a season or over the year. Some climate models project a decrease in moderate rainfall, and an increase in the length of dry periods, which offsets the increased precipitation falling during heavy events. Global temperatures have increased by 1.4 f . Hurricanes may have decreased in frequency however they have increased in severity. Go here NASA.GOV type in climate change, start your education.

Anyway, no creditable world wide measurements existed to have any actual global average, even today the only real global way to measure the average temp is from Sat 'ONLY' averages and this method has a margin of error. The claimed warming is so little that it could be a anomaly that is generated just from deviations in the accuracy of the measurement devices. No legitimate evidence to be 'proof' of the global warming and greenhouse theory exists. Computer models of systems that are not understood do not prove anything and they all fail to predict anything even in the short term. When they can precisely forecast the weather for years in advanced with a single global simulation they might have something worth looking at.

Earth’s climate history does not reveal any evidence of carbon dioxide raising temperatures; CO2 only feeds plant growth. The temperature increase Earth experienced after the end of the Little Ice Age (1300 to 1870) up to about 1940 was not caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions because industrial output during those years was too low to make any significant difference. Industrial output and CO2 emissions increased dramatically during World War II and during the post-war economic boom, but the Earth&#39;s temperature dropped after 1940 until about 1975. By the early 1970s the weather had become so cold that there was fear of a coming ice age. If CO2 was the driving force behind temperature increases, the Earth would have experienced vigorous heating during the 50s, 60s, and 70s, not remarkable cooling. <br /> <br /> When the world dramatically increased biofuel farming during the Bush and Obama administrations, CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions rose dramatically as a result of deforestation, land use change, and increased fertilizer production, yet Earth temperatures remained flat instead of rising. That fact goes counter to the basic premises of man made global warming theory. There has been no warming since 1998.

Btw imagine generating your own electricity, you won't pay any tax at all on your generated electricity only on the bought items called solar panels (if you are so worried about carbon tax). I engaged in multiple conversations but you have litterly been the most uninformed. Others at least come with some points like grand solar minimum and climate is cooling data is wrong, it one big conspiracy. Or one world order. From reasonable to plainly crazy ideas. Example if someone asks you how a smartphone works your answer would be ""it works cause it does"" I would now say I do not know exactly but I can try to understand it better with questions like why a battery works, why GPS works, why chips work what physics is needed to generate the chips. So I do not say climate change is true because they told me so. No I do because there are many points you can approach it. Own experience, burning of oil and the logic that thing dont just disappear but are converted into gasses. I saw with my own eyes bleached and destroyed corals I saw a decreased in glaciers New Zealand but also Canada and Austria and I saw forest fires in sweden drought in Europe and huge amounts of deforestation in Malaysia for palm oil. Than scientific data about melting glaciers satalite images, or temperature rise, co2 level rise. Understanding of the physics of the co2 molecule. But also news of floods and forest fires or local temperature records. So my own experiences the documentaries and scientific data plus news all fit climate change. If you doubt take a trip to Greenland or take a dive at the great barrier reef talk with the locals hear their stories. If trusting scientists in climate science is so difficult for you.

And I totally agree with you deforestation should be stopped!! And these policies should be speeded up we should leave oil in the ground and only have renewables. Every documentary about climate talks about these points. More renewables less oil and coal and stopping deforestation even replanting forests. Why do you think Europe demands every country to have at least 14% of there energy from renewable sources? Not because of carbon tax. Which most countries do not even have. But if a country has it, is it a way to stimulate companies to produce less carbon emissions which is focused on companies not on the local population. Which increases prices of the polluters and decreases prices of the non polluters. Also should these carbon tax policies reduce other taxes like low carbon companies. In the Netherlands it's even the idea to reduce taxes on electricity use for the population but an increase in gass taxes. The mathematical models are for future predictions yes. But for the tempatures measurements of yesterday we do not need any model we use our satellites and temperature measurements from over 30k stations per organization based in Europa, Japan and USA. So as example the models said in 2000 temperatures of 2015 would be around.. And in 2015 we measured the exact temperature of that year and it was around the predictions of 2000 and since 1900 we have been seeing a continuous rise. Also lokal tempatures have been breaking records constantly the last 20 years. Would this happen world wide if there would not be a warming? It would not. People that say it's the carbon tax is the reason for the whole climate change idea. Do not even put the effort into looking into the science behind it. The only thing they see is money. Carbon tax doenst disprove the 2018 heat wave, the multiple floods of the last 2 months, constant melting of sea ice, lokal tempatures recorded, droughts and increase forest fires. Ocean level rise of atm only 20cm. But also that Louisiana is litterly losing land to the ocean every day. Carbon tax has nothing to do with the science behind it it's a motivator to decrease carbon emissions and use less carbon emitting sources which is quite logic. ""Things are much more complicated"" without any explanation. It is extremely complicated to explain things that cannot be explained when they are simply flawed. As for Africa. Ghana is building a network for electricity most of their people do not even have electricity but renewable sources are way cheaper for these countries to start with in our current world. Also the countries them self decided to put up a law for carbon tax there is no worldwide carbon tax law which is extremely difficult to even apply. Because of the many different countries. But even so Africans use barely co2 per capita compared to Europeans and Americans. So even if it was possible there costs would be way lower than developed countries. And the question is why would his models be more accurate? What makes them so specialwhat does he know what others dont? And even so he still claims the climate is warming. Climte deniers that claim the world is cooling won't agree with him at all.",UCPucS5QF1aJDa99FffizSng,1,Ugzy6HvQwMcnJTrSqEl4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

On the other hand, The CO2 fraud is excellent to stop under-developed countries to develop, like in Africa, where many people are without electricity or food. The only argument for this CO2 fraud are mathematical models, which predict temperatures far more greater than measured ones.

Global warming is not the issue, the earth has been slowly warming since the last ice age and will continue to do so until it starts cooling for the next ice age. The question is the effect of CO2 released into the atmosphere by human activities. This effect is essentially trivial. This point cannot be argued with someone who does not understand the scientific method and is governed by his feelings. Open your mind and listen to the real scientists and you will learn. FYI, computer models are NOT science! They are a technological &quot;crystal ball&quot; that is just about as accurate. I think it was the great sage Yogi Berra who said, &quot;Making predictions is difficult, especially in regards to the future.&quot; Though we have all met people who have an uncanny ability to predict the past, unfortunately, the current models are unable to even predict the past behavior of the earth&#39;s climate. <br /> <br />Politicians are throwing money that they do not have at a problem that does not exist in order to finance solutions that make no difference. <br />Michael Hart",UCb7uHuFEMj1XsIVkFriqsXA,0,UgyWi0SJz9K1SemoxLp4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Scientists know that CO2 is not a &quot;heat trapper&quot;. The only data used that shows heat absorption characteristics are in closed system tests. In an open system, the range of IR absorption and radiation are how they interrelate with all other gases etc. CO2 has a narrow range in both. That means heat radiated by the ground (wide range) almost completely bypasses CO2. In other words it doesn&#39;t trap heat as claimed. What does? H2O.<br /><br />Want to have a real example? Venus and Mars both have equitable amounts of CO2 in their atmosphere. Venus is about 98% and Mars is 94%. According to the &quot;CO2 traps heat&quot; hypothesis, they should both be hot. Venus is indeed hot. Very hot. Mars is cold. So cold, in fact, that its poles are dry ice (frozen CO2).<br /><br />That at the very least should show people that CO2 is not the &quot;heat blanket&quot; that AGW proponents constantly claim.

Just FYI. i live in Mexico and this spring's record floods in the USA Midwest have damaged grain stores and delayed spring planting. Estimates reported by Guy McPherson put expected USA grain losses this year at about 30% of normal crop yields. That will affect biofuel production as well as exportable grain prices. In 2007 the global financial meltdown caused a spike in imported corn, a staple food for Mexico's poor, sparking riots in Mexico City. The riots subsided only after the Mexican government provided subsidies to buyers who, in turn, were required to pass along the ""savings"" to consumers. Meanwhile, extended drought in Central America is contributing refugee flight to Mexico and,the USA. It appears that this is just the beginning of increasing, long-term. flight from food shortages here in the Americas.

During this warming period the global climate warmed enough that a large part of Greenland was actually green and was colonized by the Viking people who grew crops and tended herds of grazing animals (Hancock and Brian 613-617). Agriculture in Europe thrived as the growing season grew longer and crops could be grown further north (Hancock and Brian 666). Humanity&#39;s standard of living steadily improved for centuries as the food supply continued to increase with the warming climate. Global warming continued until sometime in the 13th or 14th century when the Medieval Warming period transformed into the Medieval Cooling Period (also know as the dark ages). When the climate started cooling, agriculture production started to fall and there was not enough food to feed the people or their herd animals. The Vikings were forced to abandon their Greenland colony and turn to raiding to survive (Wallace 16-24). In Europe, people starved and diseases were rampant. A plague was responsible for the death of nearly 25% of the know population of the earth (Hancock and Brian 613-617).<br /><br />Hancock, Paul L., Brian J. Skinner. The Oxford Companion to The Earth. Chicago: Oxford University Press, 2000.<br /><br />Wallace, Birgitta. “Viking Farewell.” Beaver December 2006/January 2007 Volume 86 Issue 6 Page 16-24. 8 April 2009.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There is a good reason why &quot;human Caused&quot; global cooling/warming/climate change alarmist always start their measurements in the 1880&#39;s. That is when the world was just starting to warm up from the depth of the Medieval cooling period. That way they do not have to explain that modern temperatures are just now getting back to the height of the Medieval warming period. Makes it much more dramatic that way.<br /><br /><a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024008"">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024008</a><br /><a href=""https://cdn.iopscience.com/images/1748-9326/8/2/024008/Full/erl456418f3_online.jpg"">https://cdn.iopscience.com/images/1748-9326/8/2/024008/Full/erl456418f3_online.jpg</a><br /><a href=""http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/natural-cycle#section-7"">http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/natural-cycle#section-7</a><br /><a href=""http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/natural-cycle/images/542M_palaeotemps_2385x1067.png/image_large"">http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/natural-cycle/images/542M_palaeotemps_2385x1067.png/image_large</a>",UCQLlpwcp-ax40rN1AQwg9XA,0,Ugx4LpSXYGEOkVEfkBx4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

And you will see why Global warming has been changed to climate change. You can see there is a period from about 1935 to about 1980 where the temperature is virtually flat. You’ll also see prior to 1935 and after 1980 the slope of the line looks very similar. But the CO2 didn’t start increasing in the Atmosphere until about 1945. So why is the temperature rising prior to 1935 why did it stay flat all the way until 1980 if the CO2 was increasing in 1945. And why is the slope of the increased the same in the last few years as it was prior to 1935. No climate change model will match this data. There is absolutely no correlation between CO2 concentration and the temperatures on this graph. Also an interesting change to the 1930 data and that if you look at the Raw data the temperatures they are much higher in fact higher than they are today.,UCqfgB-pe4JQsyfejeZTqmig,0,UgyIzO73uTntggHVCyh4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Thousands of climate scientists agree that the 1/100th of 1% of increased CO2 that has occurred (mostly due to mankind) in the last century most likely plays an insignificant (and many believe, beneficial) role in climate. This is primarily due to the fact that the warming affect caused by CO2 is logarithmic and is virtually saturated at the current 400 PPM level. The whole climate alarmist thing is almost comical until you see politicians wanting to rid the world of fossil fuels in 10 years, or eliminate air travel or beef production. Amazingly, some are even stupid enough to believe that wind and solar can replace fossil fuels and nuclear power. If you want to see how that&#39;s working out, look no further than Germany and Australia (the crash test dummies of wind and solar) those countries now pay many magnitudes higher for dangerously unreliable energy. Very sad considering the German electric grid used to be a model of efficiency and reliability.

I lived through the same time period and, as a science reporter in the 70s, I can tell you just the opposite, having interviewed numerous scientists then. The global cooling scare of the 70s arose from a handful of scientists (not the majority, who were in fact warning about global warming even then) who worried about our ever-growing sulfate aerosol pollution problem. Sulfate aerosols, produced from burning coal, reflect sunlight and cool the planet the same way aerosols from volcanoes do. We were, in fact, smack in the middle of a bit of a cooling trend then, so the concern had some validity, especially if we continued to spew increasing amounts of the stuff.  Because aerosols were also causing premature deaths and massive health and lung problems worldwide, the U.S. and other countries decided to do something and passed legislation (including the Clean Air Act) that significantly reduced sulfate aerosol pollution. The clean-up was so effective that climate scientists can actually mark the time period of the 70s by the absence of the aerosol pollutants in ice cores.

Based on an early Greenland ice core record produced back in 1997, versions of the graph have, variously, mislabeled the x-axis, excluded the modern observational temperature record and conflated a single location in Greenland with the whole world."" The GISP2 ice core only extends to 1855, yet the graph is frequently presented with the mislabel of ""Years before present,"" leaving out over a century of current data. Sometimes the graph labels 1950 as ""The Present"" and doesn't mention that the ""present"" means 1950, leaving out seven decades of our greatest warming. There are other misleading variations.

How about Greenland&#39;s glaciers ? Sure once they pass the land mass underneath them, the sea undermines them and of course  part of the glaciers break off or calve into the ocean creating icebergs , this is just the course  it takes , most glaciers move over vast amounts of water trapped under them so it is easier for the glaciers to move a foot per year . Icebergs are not caused by global warming . it is just a matter of physics . I don&#39;t think taking scientific data from places that are surrounded by concrete and asphalt  is a true record of the temperature . We also know that Krakatoa put so much ash into the air that the earth went through a volcanic winter . That kind of offsets the Co2 effect somewhat . Why is it cold at night ? the answer is not that hard to figure out , The earth has always been heated by  our Sun , when sunspots are active  we get more solar flares which in turn heats the earth  more than if the sun was quiet or less active. The climate scientists are so blinded by the co2 they cant see other causes for  the earth&#39;s warming and that is the worst  thing to do . Of course the politics are in the way of untenured scientists from speaking the truth , they have to kowtow to the agenda or get de-funded by the government . See carbon taxes are going to be a huge cash cow for those nations imposing them , Like say Canada . Climate science is still in its infancy  they are still guessing the true nature , but they will miss out the true nature of the problem once they say the science is settled  and there is a consensus . If CO2 was the problem why has China been allowed to start up a coal burning electrical plant one every 2 weeks since 2012 ? India and  the pacific rim are building them too .  Isn&#39;t the science settled like 97 % consensus ? Well  science has never been consensus or the earth would still be flat .

They beltch a lot of warm waters and with it many gases, among them CO2 and CH4. You can see one mini-vulcan from another kilometer after kilometer. No end!

You guys make claims about reality, therefore you should give us evidence and nobody should be criticized for questioning the validity of the evidence and examining it closely.<br /><br />1. We can&#39;t measure the global average temperature.<br />30.000 Weather Stations don&#39;t make a reliable record if you have to get the global average temperature to the fraction of a degree. The globe has a 510.000.000 km² surface and a 15km high troposphere. Not to mention that most stations aren&#39;t even used and about 80% of all the stations are in Europe and the US. Almost none are in the ocean which makes up 70% of the earths surface. So we can&#39;t even measure the earths global temperature. We are guessing at best.<br /><br />2. Raw data shows no warming.<br />Look it up. Warming is created by using models which guesses the temperature on places we have no data about and by weighting the weather station data differently. Also all recent warming can be accounted for by &quot;data adjustments&quot;. Don&#39;t believe me? Google it!<br /><br />3. Satelites use models, too.<br />Even the satelite data is based on unprovable and unfalsifiable models. They still showed no warming for 15 years. Then they did their usual business and cooled the past, because they suddenly found some error in the models. Which proves my point. The models are unfalsifiable. You cannot truly know how good they work.<br /><br />4. The climate gate scandal gives us reason to be suspicious.<br />Examining the leaked climate gate mails gives us a valid reason to question the integrity and honesty of certain climate scientist and the institutions they work for.<br /><br />5. The observable predictions are too vague.<br />Almost any extreme weather is treated as evidence for climate change. Snow = evidence for climate change. Drought = evidence for climate change. Heavy rain = evidence for climate change. Science need concrete, measurable predictions. The alarmist failed yet to hand them to us.<br /><br />Conclusion: There is no way anyone can have justified confidence in anthropogenic global warming by the data scientist have shown to us.",UCCxF3lMStQNUeCWAx-RsQuw,0,UgwZ_I7EeDJ1bkuS4l54AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

At best greenhouse gases can only redirect what something else is giving it, not generate heat in and of itself. Nor do they reflect geothermal energy, so it is not our own core. All that's left is the central fusion furnace of our solar system. Unless you can provide another source of heat, then the main thing heating our planet is the sun.

Therefore, the rise of CO2 is not the CAUSE, but the EFFECT of the temperature&#39;s increase.<br /><br />Moreover, vulcanic eruption releases huge amount of gases in the atmosphere, then what happens?

However, when vast amounts of CO2 are pumped into the atmosphere by huge basaltic flows (Flood Basalts) like those that created the Siberian Traps and the Deccan Traps, then CO2 leads the temperature increase no matter what is in progress with the Milankovitch Cycles. In our current situation, it is the unsequestration of tremendous volumes of carbon by the burning of fossil fuels that is causing the global temperature increases. This is being compounded by the additional release of land based methane and oceanic methane clathrate due to our warming biosphere. <br /><br />We can only say that contemporary global warming is ‘natural’ if we deny our culpability — otherwise we’d have to take responsibility and make things right (never mind that the biodiversity of all life on Earth is at stake).

Every since the 1980, people have been pointing out that the earth has been warming since the little ice age and have pointed out that the sunspots caused the cooling. Alarmist can not defeat the argument, so they created a smoke screen. They created a theory that the solar irradiance  was the cause of global warming, the defeated it by pointing out that after 1970, the two separated. The reality is, solar irradiance was only SIMULAR to temperature for 30 years, from 1940 to 1970, when both decreased. At that time, the 1930's were widely recognized as being the hottest decade on record. Soon after than, they altered the records, claiming that their algorithm was more accurate, and that lowered all the temperatures before 1950. What this did was put the temperature inline with the solar irradiance between 1900 and 1940, extending the period that the two were aligned. The problem is solar irradiance INCLUDES sunspots. So now they use the same graph and call it solar temperature. The reality is, NO ONE ever proposed a theory that solar temperature had anything to do with the short term climate, only long term. proxies show that the solar temperature is the same now as it was in the Holocene maximum, the bronze age warming period, the roman warming period and the mwp.

The most important thing I can tell you is the the climate will affect your life the same way it did mine. Not much.

Is cooler now, and we have air conditioning too. I used to travel in a business suit by car (again no air conditioning) in temperatures that went over 110 routinely in the 60s. You are being lied to by socialist con artists who want you to be their slave and want your help in getting you there. Socialism kills by genocide, the weather is pretty much harmless unless you are very unlucky. The climate of North America has not changed very much in the last 80 years except its a little cooler now and we don't get as much violent weather or flooding now. The oceans are not getting ""acid"" and they are not rising (although they used too) the minor local changes in sea level are caused more by erosion, silting, continental rebound, and plate tectonics. The land and the sea bottom pitch like the sea too although at a much slower rate.

In fact, very recently, as climate change alarmists started taking over the temperature measurement process, they&#39;ve actually both fraudulently altered the climate data, injecting actual &quot;man-made&quot; warming in the process AND they&#39;ve shut down measurement sites that tended to show cooling or otherwise did not support their &quot;humans are destroying the Earth with carbon&quot; agenda.<br /><br />A famous example of this was a mountain top temperature measurement station in South America which was shut down and a station at much lower altitude, in a desert, was subsequently used to provide an &quot;average value&quot; instead of that which was given from the higher altitude station which, obviously, consistently gave much cooler readings.<br /><br />To accurately measure the Earth&#39;s temperature we would have to simultaneously measure every bit of the atmosphere, every bit of the ocean and every bit of the land surface, in fact not just the surface but every bit to a considerable depth, to come up with a reasonable value of what the temperature of the Earth is. <br /><br />We have not done this once, let alone multiple times, therefore any claim that we have measured any significant increase in the Earth&#39;s temperature is not only false, but those making it know it&#39;s false.<br /><br />Am I denying that the Earth is warming. No, I actually hope it is. Another lie that&#39;s been implied if not actually stated is that we&#39;ve already exceeded what should be considered the &quot;optimum temperature&quot; for the Earth. The fact is the Earth could use some &quot;global warming&quot; to get to that optimum temperature - we&#39;re not there yet by any reasonable consideration of the facts.<br /><br />Why do you think they called the previous warmer times (that climate alarmists now deny ever occurred - and they have the nerve to call climate realists &quot;deniers&quot;!) &quot;OPTIMUM&quot;. There was the Medieval Warm Period and there was the &quot;Holocene Climate Optimum&quot;, both of which featured a warmer world than that in which we live today.<br /><br />Consider the alternative... no, seriously, the only constant is change and that goes for climate also. The point being if the planet isn&#39;t warming it&#39;s cooling. Cooling is in fact it&#39;s natural tendency and the cold, dry times are the times life struggles and dies. The warm, wet times are the times the biosphere - and humans - thrive! <br /><br />It&#39;s a fact - you can look it up!",UCk3CZUuksiW8NM3ucu8ynOw,0,Ugyn8e9NgPyjB5kU69l4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The sun&#39;s magnetic field has been low allowing more cosmic rays to strike our planet. Solar Cycle #25 has been predicted to be low determined by observing solar cycles for hundreds of years .

Take the literal meaning of a scientist, and you can say weather forecasters are scientists, and they are wrong about 90% of the time. Scientists are making guesses as to the age of the earth. They weren't there to observe and it's impossible to re-create the beginnings of the earth, so speaking literally, you cannot do true science regarding the age of the earth. They try, though! They use methods like radiometric dating to approximate the age of the earth, but to use that, they have to ASSUME A LOT. First, they have to assume they know what the makeup of the rock was before it started decaying. I won't get into that much for now, but let's pretend they know what they are doing. There are massive numbers of examples where this method doesn't work. A 100-yo tree can get struck by lightning and become petrified. That petrified tree (rock) now dates to millions of years old. HMM. Take a particular rock, and depending on what method of decay you use, a rock can date to millions of years old and that same rock can date to nearly a billion years old. HMM. How about the DNA recovered from partially-fossilized animals? That scientist will say that animal died millions of years ago, yet that same scientist will say DNA cannot be intact after just thousands of years. HMM. What about the sediment at the bottom of the ocean? Calculate sedimentation rates (current) and the sediment that should be there after millions or billions of years just isn't there. HMM. Take the erosion at Victoria Falls and Niagara Falls. That suggests a young earth. Scientists would like to say the Grand Canyon is evidence of a process that takes millions of years, yet there was a recent example of how this could be much faster when a canyon about 1/40th the size of the Grand Canyon was carved by mudflows in just a few hours after an eruption near Mt St Helens. There is so much evidence that ""scientists"" ignore about the Grand Canyon because they insist it must be millions of years old. I could go on and on and on... In reality, scientists know very little and whenever scientists or archeologists make a new discovery, it just proves the Bible correct again and again. The only thing current science disputes with the Bible is the age of the earth, and there is SOOOOOO much evidence to suggest the earth isn't old. Look up the solar paradox. Look up the lunar paradox. Look up the Cambrian Explosion. Yes, I do believe the Bible to be more credible. It hasn't been proven wrong yet and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls proves that the writings contained in the Bible predicted scientific ""discoveries"" centuries before scientists ""discovered"" them (ie the existence of subatomic particles, stars emitting radiation, ocean currents, expanding universe, etc.)",UCYEdElW5zWDY6qTwkqWPbcQ,1,UgzPHQyStORt82oZbPJ4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

All ghg&#39;s SLOW heat leaving the planet, but co2 is the PRIMARY means of its being kicked out of the atmosphere.<br /><br />Alarmist will be quick to point out that the frequencies co2 absorbs is down BUT what they do not tell you is the frequencies it RADIATES on, has doubled its output in the last 50 years. There is only a small band where co2 absorption does not match other ghg&#39;s. THOSE are the ones they measure. The problem is, when co2 radiates, it does MOST of the radiating on frequencies that are not in that small band. There are certain frequencies that co2 can easily release energy and ones that it can but only if forced. Most are in between. The ones that it easily releases infrared is match by one of h2o absorption bands. This means that when co2 releases it in the middle of the atmosphere, going downwards, h2o will most likely absorb it. When it goes up, there is not much h2o to absorb it so it reaches space. THAT is why the stratosphere is cooling more than their models predicted.<br /><br />Another point he missed was claiming that the things from the first being the only things from space that caused warming and cooling. What he totally ignored is the sunspots and cosmic radiation.<br /><br />During the little ice age it is a proven fact (glaciology) that the cosmic radiation hitting the earth was higher and record show the sunspots disappeared. In fact it has been proven that this link has been as far back as we can test. Laboratory test have confirmed that the radiation from the cosmos can cause clouds to form sooner than they would otherwise.

And at the end of the SUMMER when the temperatures peak to the highest levels, CO2 levels in the atmosphere dwindle to around 150 ppmpv.

And wouldn&#39;t winters be much warmer if CO2 trapped heat, seeing that the CO2 levels in the atmosphere peak in the winter? <br /><br />Correction; a forest actually absorbs heat, clear cutting does not reflect the heat back into space! It is actually cooler in a forest than in a city!<br /><br />What you failed to mention was the atmospheres of all the other planets in our solar system are changing too. Thus there is no need to assume climate change has anything to do with human interaction! The only way climate change could be pinned on humans if all the other planets experiencing signs of climate change were occupied by humans too. That&#39;s the only way to pin climate change on us!<br /><br />Get this, CO2 is a natural gas, found on all the other planets in our solar system but in much higher concentrations than here on Earth. So why does Earth&#39;s atmosphere have much less CO2 than the other planets? Trees, plants and plankton in the oceans! These things remove the carbon in the air and use the carbon for food, then release oxygen as a waste. Thus why in the winter the CO2 levels in the USA increase to 400 ppmpv, plants are dormant, are not removing the CO2, so CO2 levels increase to 400 ppmpv. And clear cutting of trees and killing plankton in the oceans is the reason why the CO2 levels have been increasing over the decades. Less trees, plants and or plankton in the oceans and the CO2 levels increase each year while the oxygen levels decrease at an equally opposite rate.<br /><br />There is a solution to this and it has nothing to do with limiting or taxing the use of natural fuels the Earth provides. Simply stop killing off the plankton in the oceans and stop deforestation, cutting down live trees! If there are less trees, plants and or plankton in the oceans from year to year then CO2 will continue to increase and O2 will continue to dwindle in our atmosphere. Taxation will not stop or prevent anything. The only thing it will do is make governments rich and limit poor people from buying fuels.<br /><br />And yes, all fuels are natural, made by the Earth, they are not left over from organic life, i.e, fossil fuels! Want evidence, look at Titan, one of Saturn&#39;s moons! It has hydrocarbons pooled in lakes on it, more than the hydrocarbon lakes Earth ever had. Oil, coal, natural gas, are all considered hydrocarbons. So if hydrocarbons are made by planets and moons then they are renewable, natural, not a limited fossil fuel! Must be why some of the depleted oil wells once forgotten had filled with oil once again. Of course the oil companies do not want you to believe this because they can charge you more for oil, well, as long as you and everyone else believes that oil is in limited supplies. I can see why they want to make us believe that every problem has a taxation solution. There is much money to be made. What&#39;s just one more lie anyways, right?

We can not no matter what we do survive in our great numbers without petro chemicals and other fossil fuels, our fertilizers that help feed us are made from fossil fuels, our machines that harvest said crops are made with products that used fossil fuels to refine the raw materials. they are ran on fossil fuels. He clothes We wear were either made or grown using fossil fuels. We strip mine huge swaths of land to collect these minerals. We live in houses made of concrete, steel, wood, plastic and numerous minerals that are refined using fossil fuels. Our buildings cover large areas of natural habitat that sequestered carbon dioxide. Ironically enough wood since I mentioned it is a natural sequestering agent of carbon when it is alive not cut up with saws and mills that are ran on fossil fuels. Besides cutting down forest which unlike this video claims collect carbon and release oxygen and water vapor which are noted cooling agents, we brought earth worms to North American forests and have permanently change the ecology of the evergreen forest with effects that are till not completely known (but it isn&#39;t good we do know that but we wont see the after effects for 200 or more years still. . Our crops strip natural eco systems into man made single specie tracts that idle land devoid of life for months at a time (not collecting carbon dioxide as the natural would do). We use transportation that is derived from fossil fuels (I don&#39;t care if it is a bicycle, a public train, a boat, an airplane or a car, they all use fossil fuels and harm the environment in one way or another). <br />My point is we all contribute and we all have absolutely no way to fix this problem at this current time other then either becoming hunter gatherers that live off the natural land (which 7,000,000,000+ people could not survive doing) or we need to reduce our population by around 5,000,000,000 people, which isn&#39;t going to happen. <br />I am not a climate change denier but I am a realist and at this current time in human history there is no scientific way to support a growing world population without producing carbon dioxide. The only other thing we could possibly do and it won&#39;t stop the problem just slow it down with the hopes that the future we will discover a new technology, and that is recycle, and refuse items that aren&#39;t needed for life.

Hell even our medication and medical supplies are more then likely made from the petrochemical industry. <br />It is ok to be smart you really need to stress that people need to Invest into technologies that are more efficient or even at this time elusive (fusion reactors). There is no magic silver bullet, it will take trillions of dollars invested into everything from, transportation to building materials and emerging technologies, perhaps ones that don&#39;t exist (fusion which maybe the silver bullet). People need to be educated to limit thier reproduction (most of us in the Western hemisphere do tis already but it needs to be spread to Africa and the Asian continents. <br />anyways I am done, I just really would like to hear and see videos that stress solutions not reinforce the problems that most of us are aware exist.",UCJ4wzjqTHycqlk0LmDVpbOA,0,UgxhvotBlT-LEIWMpPh4AaABAg,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

What is the most influential factor in temperature Ill give u a hint it comes up every morning and is the sole reason earth is not and Ice Cube. The sun has been undergoing unprecedented activity since pretty much the whole Gobal Warming bs was invented. If you dont believe me just google Solar activity. The sun at its most active in what scientist estimate to be over 8000 years. You will hear things like 97 percent of scientist believe co2 is the culprit. Guess what Government sponsors 97 percent of science. If government wants u to believe that a gas Trees use to photosynthesize is causing this all they got to do is tell scientist you find this or I pull your grant. Why would they want this. Well money and power of course. If can tax people for breathing, building, farming, pretty much anything then wow what a good tax that would be. Either that or they want to bring down Industrialized countries so that that everyone is under a One world Government that would be great too. Then walmart just wouldnt rule the US it would rule the world. I challenge anyone to take a Clear box Fill it with Nitrogen, Then add 380 part per million of co2 and take a measure of temperature with and with out the co2 while in ths sun if see if makes any difference guess what it dont. I mean this is what we breathe out and what plants breathe in. Its a gas that essential for life. CO2 Gobal warming is not true. Like he said below average temps. only in 1980s.

But why is it happening.<br /><br />Well, you may have to go back to Biggest Oil Rockefellers when they created this &quot;climate change&quot; scam. They took a perfectly good science term and changed the definition. Climate has been changing naturally for nearly 4.5 Billion years; but now it&#39;s &quot;recent, dangerous and man made.&quot; Dumb!<br /><br />Global Warming made civilization possible 12,000 years ago. And these guys remain clueless how good that was. Or even why it was good. And that started out far faster than today&#39;s UN &quot;horror story.&quot; The Holocene began with a bang -- +7C of warming in 50 years -- nearly 5x the UN&#39;s scare.<br /><br />Has it been warming? Yes! And that&#39;s good, too. We live in an Ice Age that&#39;s 2.6 million years old. Those who have an ice fetish don&#39;t have much intelligence going for them. Sorry! Ice kills; warmth promotes life. Just look at the population gradient from polar ice to equatorial heat.<br /><br />We have Milankovitch cycles modifying the amount of warmth we get, but the sun&#39;s indirect effect on cloud formation is perhaps the strongest single effect.<br /><br />CO2 is not the 800 pound gorilla these guys are making it out to be. How do we know? For one thing, temperatures have been up and down a lot, but the CO2 has been going up steadily. If temperature was more sensitive to CO2 levels, it should be more in lock-step with CO2 increases.<br /><br />And more CO2 is a good thing. Plants need it. During the last glacial period of the <b><i>current Ice Age,</i></b> CO2 levels fell to 180 ppm which is 40 ppm above <b><i>the &quot;red line&quot; of permanent death for all life on Earth.</i></b> That&#39;s right: PERMANENT!

Central banks routinely pump massive amounts of freshly printed dollars into markets (taxation through diminishing value of your current dollars) and use &quot;stimulus&quot; packages to drive vastly increased consumption in the here and now and continuously take money from our future progeny to fuel even more consumption through borrowing (which is essentially delayed taxation).

The most consistent expectation, based on the data and the best models, is that clouds have responded with dramatic warming feedbacks in our climate, contributing much (possibly most) of the warming.<br /><br />Clouds are the most important uncertainty in climatology, given that clouds determine the global climate sensitivity.

When sunlight falls on the ground it is reflected more than when it falls on plants.<br />the thing not mentioned or taken into account is that due to photosynthesis some of the energy falling on plants is stored as chemical potential energy. Go touch a green leaf on a tree on a bright sunny day and you&#39;ll find it isn&#39;t terribly warm. this reduces the &quot;cooling&quot; effects mentioned by clearing land and results in less energy from the sunlight being reflected as the ground will be warmer than the vegetation adjacent on any given sunny day.<br />Also, if the ground did reflect more energy back towards space, the theory that this would reduce atmospheric temperatures is actually negated somewhat by the theory of greenhouse gasses trapping the reflected energy.<br /><br />The rest seems plausible. And I&#39;m not denying the global temperature is rising, but I have my own theory....<br /><br />Back to storing sunlight chemically as chemical potential energy, life on earth is like a battery. I&#39;d bet that more of the warming is caused by us releasing millions of years worth of this &quot;stored sunlight&quot; (via fossil fuels) in a very short (compared to total earth history) period. Almost everything we humans do (including being a living creature) generates heat. there&#39;s approx. 1 billion cars on the world&#39;s roads, each generating (releasing prehistoric energy) a very large amount of heat would heat the atmosphere. Every electrical device ever made generates heat. The planet can only release so much heat back into space as infrared radiation, so it stands to reason that the atmosphere will heat up.<br /><br />I definitely believe that this is more likely to cause rises in global mean temperature than co2/methane/etc.<br /><br />Sit in a home with a tiny heater on a cold day/night and you&#39;ll be a bit warmer. add another 20 heaters and you&#39;ll find it much hotter. this is because like the planet, a home is an almost closed loop. energy arrives from the outside and a small amount returns to the outside but most of it is going to remain within. the rate at which a house or a planet returns energy to outside of this loop is somewhat constant.",UCZCBb_bURw04Add_-IRMSsQ,0,UgiZUsO-AW_NdngCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

It is one of many theories explaining the little ice age, so we have no proof that it will effect our temperatures hugely. Many sites say a new one in the 2030's would only lower our temperatures by 0.1C, which is pathetic compared to current warming rates. Solar activity is decreasing, no one is denying it. But the Earth is warming. Studies by literally every scientific community shows this. Global Warming is one of the most tested theories around, and it's still here. If the Earth is cooling, care to explain the record temperatures every month in several places around the world? Or the shrinking polar ice caps? Am I aware people are being censored?

Trees grow, which consumes energy and prevents its release into the air as heat. Also, trees grow root systems underground, which stores energy and carbon long term, as it becomes coal. The living trunks and limbs of trees don&#39;t fall off like the leaves so these also store energy and carbon throughout the life of the tree. <br /><br />CO2 blanketing may play a role, but the solar-heating effect of sunlight being absorbed by dead pavement and buildings is increasing the amount of hot air entering the atmosphere. Natural desert regions have the same effect, but their drought is able to expand faster because of dry heat produced by human developments. Sandwich a forest between two deserts and it will dry out faster than if one of the deserts was left as intact forest, and that is why deforestation of land via development is causing drought to spread at a faster rate that it would naturally.<br /><br />Also, remember that water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas similar to CO2. So as the average temperature of an area rises, the amount of water vapor that can be held in air as relative humidity is increasing. Without forests and trees to shade-cool and attract condensation, humidity lingers and blankets the ground, which is being baked directly by sunlight because the clouds can&#39;t condense to provide shade without the help of forests on the ground. All this basically amounts to gradual desertification, but there seems to be a great deal of vagueness about the details of how the heat and evaporation operate vis-a-vis forested land.",UCAbsMtVMDSWRSIlqHQAZVGA,0,Ugj37SW4rTG62HgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

At that time the view of the atmosphere was that it was in 3 layers; troposphere, stratosphere and ionosphere. within the last 4 years, I sought to update and went on the internet and got a very detailed article that also included the exosphere. It also got into climate and the atmosphere and said plenty about water vapor but not word one about CO2. Beyond that, as proof of the general ignorance of the role and strength of H20 vapor, one of the Japanese car companies was bragging about one if its products about 6 years back and as a brag about how &quot;eco-friendly&quot; it is said that it doesn&#39;t emit CO2 but hamrless &quot;water vaper&quot;<br /><br />Prior to that, in 1984 or early &#39;85 I was listening to the radio and heard a report about a sunspot cycle that lasted from 400 to 450 years that subsumed the 11-year cycles and it said that this was the strongest driver of temperature and that we were in a warming trend. see &quot;Maunder Minimum&quot;.

During the roman empire it was hotter than today then i cooled down in the dark ages then it warmed again in the enlightenment. It&#39;s not co2 so we can still use fossil fuels (ofcourse we still NEED a better and cheaper). Yes Co2 traps heat but it doesnt contribute a large amount of tempature change. We aren&#39;t causing global warming so let&#39;s just leave it alone or we will cause more damage than we can control. Co2 levels doesn&#39;t have a lot of correlation with the earth heating up if you look at the data.

Over millions of years under high pressure and high temperature, the remains of these organisms transformed into what we know today as fossil fuels. Coal, natural gas, and petroleum are all fossil fuels that formed under similar conditions. Today, petroleum is found in vast underground reservoirs where ancient seas were located.

I mean, it's not necessarily the case that they're banding together. But (whether acting alone or in concert) they have waged a campaign of disinformation and doubt so effective that only half the public (roughly) think climate change is real, compared to 97% of scientists. It's the same thing ""Big Tobacco"" did when it turned out their cancer sticks caused cancer. They waged a campaign of disinformation and doubt for years before congress finally did something about it. Before that, cigarettes were seen as a great way to lower blood pressure and lose weight! Doctors recommended smoking for their patients! Now we know better, but every year the tobacco companies spent convincing people that cigarettes were harmless was another year some poor sap got hooked on them. The cost was in the lives and quality of life of their customers, whom they deceived into thinking their products were harmless. Oil companies have done the same thing here. Every year they managed to convince people climate change was a hoax, fixing the problem became more expensive and our odds of success went down. It's flagrantly immoral to peddle disinformation and doubt when there is no room for it, and that's what we talk about when we talk about ""Big Oil"". They're sacrificing our future for a few more years of profit. Also, Hydrogen cars are far less energy efficient than Electric. It takes 3.75-4.50 times more energy to produce the hydrogen fuel it takes move a set distance as it takes to power an electric vehicle to move the same distance. And that 3.75 number is only if you use precious natural gas as the base substance you refine the hydrogen fuel from, thus diverting the least polluting fossil fuel from energy generation to fuel production. Frankly, I look forward to the day that we turn our vehicles over to electric and we run our electric grids on renewable and carbon neutral sources of energy. But that future is far from guaranteed, especially if the campaign of misinformation continues on as it has for the past couple decades.",UCHK4H168Z6Ryyf4Pkv8UT7g,1,UghfPL26xhaCBHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

If evaporation increases, precipitation increases. Both of these negative feedbacks will cause a subsequent cooling effect. Amazing ain't it?

It is the amount of energy in the whole system of the climate. More energy means more activity, whether it is the water cycle, the winds and jet steams, the ocean currents, and so on. We aren&#39;t seeing mega hurricanes with energy concentrated in one area, but all of the other weather events are amplified. More rain or snow in one area, longer and hotter droughts in others, the jet steam moving farther to areas it doesn&#39;t normally go, and differing behavior of sea ice at the poles. It is only going to get more unpredictable in the worst ways because the system is working differently than we have ever observed in the past.",UCX8fvermjtR7nNRUnZLycIw,0,UgiW2VwhQfi43ngCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Scientific rhetoric is one thing, but if a scientist in his field is found to be outright faking data, nobody stays polite about it.  A scientist is not held back from calling a peer's work 'corrupt' or fraudulent, if it is true.  Judith Curry and others who spoke against the NOAA data were certainly rejecting key methods in the adjustments, but none of them claimed the data was fabricated, as you say.  Even NOAA recognizes that every time they release an updated data set, there's always a small backlash as people test it and decide whether it's solid. You asked if I would help find the petition.  I would, but when I tried before, it was so tedious sifting through all of the mindless trash that the search engine would produce (you know how the Internet is).  If you'd like to dive into the Internet and try to find it, I would appreciate your efforts, but based on what I heard from the scientists, I don't expect the petition to support your assertion that NOAA is faking data. I know you have a life outside of Youtube, but if you get some time, I think the greater issue to address is not this small controversy.  As I cited, there are other reputable data sets.  But the bigger issue (which we can't solve here, of course) is how much each factor contributes to the global warming we've measured, and how anthropogenic CO2 changes this climate.",UCk62tY2svp9QVVMRIdfuzmg,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Further, comparing the R squared values correlating three different values to atmospheric CO2 levels: Global surface temperature and monthly CO2 change: R squared = 0.47636 Sea surface anomaly and monthly CO2 change: R squared = 0.5528 Annual change in fossil carbon use and the annual change in CO2: R squared = 0.05386 The R squared value of fossil carbon use is close to 1/10th the statistical correlation that is apparent in global surface temperatures and sea surface anomaly, meaning that the correlation to fossil carbon use is a weaker correlation.

This means one of a few things: 1st, the satellites are misreading the surface temperatures.  If the satellites are misreading the temperatures, then it is likely that the problem is systemic and a flaw in their   2nd, the satellites are right.  Then there is a flaw in the methodology of the data collection of data from the land based stations. 3rd, there is tampering (intentional or unintentional) with either the satellites or the land based stations.  Being that tampering with the satellite feeds is more prohibitive, it is more likely that there are factors interfering with the land based stations. Second, there is a fair concern that CO2's effects are not uniform on the environment.  The article I cited served to bring light to some of the modeling issues that depend on different paradigms of upper atmosphere energy disbursal patterns.  There was a lot of small-ball which suggested a different series assumptions for predicting the dynamics of high atmosphere energy and how that serves to alter the effects of CO2 greenhousing. The purpose was simply to show that the assumption that CO2 increase = proportional temperature increase has variables which are not often discussed. Third, there is a high percentage chance that the largest culprit of CO2 production is natural, not man-made. (http://notrickszone.com/2013/03/02/most-of-the-rise-in-co2-likely-comes-from-natural-sources/) Part of this particular article makes the point that, ""The natural CO2 flux to and from oceans and land plants amounts to approximately 210 gigatons of carbon annually. Man currently causes about 8 gigatons of carbon to be injected into the atmosphere, about 4% of the natural annual flux."" Now this does not mean that the 4% is not too much.  It could be simply beyond the system's ability to tolerate the imbalance, or the 4% number could a realistic reflection of the minimalization of the man-made contribution.

This potentially could cause a greenhouse effect.' The truth is CO2 will cause a greenhouse effect--there's no way around that, but the question is how the climate will respond to that contribution.  Most of this uncertainty in climate sensitivity stems from things like changes in global cloud cover or oceanic activity, leading to questions like, 'Will the global cloud cover shift toward cooling the planet or amplifying global warming?' The paper which you've cited has to be purchased through a subscription but the abstract is available.  The paper is asserting the inadequacies of a particular climate model, the 'M15', saying it underestimates climate sensitivity and consistently predicts lower temperatures than what is being measured.  As far as I can see this is a common thing for models: failing to accurately predict climate sensitivity. The abstract of your citation certainly doesn't support the idea that atmospheric CO2 may be inconsequential in the Earth's climate.  If anything, it leans toward the opposite: global climate is actually more sensitive than previously thought.  This is something climatologists continue to wrestle with, but perfectly accurate global cloud cover data is only recently being collected, I think, which hinders how much evidence one can find.",UCk62tY2svp9QVVMRIdfuzmg,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The solar bit is just one of the items that falls under the category of ""alternative causality"". Is it the only one? No. There was a gentleman reminding people of the Macro Ice Age theory, which people seem to forget. I just had a big set of academic papers easily at my disposal regarding the topic, it was easier to bundle those. You are correct, climatologists must consider solar activity, and good ones may even publish the assumptions that they made regarding those activities. It is difficult however because there are innumerable influences on ""climate"" in general, so achieving a reasonable level of control for analysis is a challenge. There are higher levels of CO2 in the air today than at many earlier times, which usually causes greening. This potentially could cause a greenhouse effect. In answer to your question though... One of my late posts in response to Steven Bee included this paper: ""Misdiagnosis of Earth climate sensitivity based on energy balance model results"" http://engine.scichina.com/publisher/scp/journal/SB/60/15/10.1007/s11434-015-0806-z?slug=full%20text It is important because climate sensitivity to CO2 directly influences what is an acceptable level of CO2. It is possible that there is a 50/50, 45 degree line correlating CO2 to climatological effects; it is also possible that it is not a consistent return on CO2 investment. You in particular don't need to read all of the citations, you can conduct civil discussion. One of the other reasons that I keep posting so many sources is because it is a myth that there is absolute uniformity regarding scientific opinion on man-made, catastrophic, global warming. There is a diversity of thought out there. Geologists and Paleontologists have a different perspective, for example. I am not advocating a single one per se, only that there are a LOT of directions. There is a serious ""Gaslight"" effect, propaganda trying to convince people that only crazy or self interested people dissent. Dissenters get labeled and marginalized (deniers, as if I deny the holocaust or something equally as odious), it is a bit concerning what percentage of people engage in it. They also tend to make it very personal.

My objective, as stated before, is not to convince the world of one position or another.

This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014). Corresponding transition matrices of both data sets appear similar and it is qualitatively evaluated by high values of 2-dimensional correlation found between transition matrices of ENSO and Sunspots. The associated transition diagrams show that each state communicates with the others. Presence of stronger self-communication (between same states) confirms periodic behaviour among the states. Moreover, closeness found in the expected number of visits from one state to the other show the existence of a possible relation between Sunspots and ENSO data. Moreover, perfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can help to explore the information about the related variables.

First, let me point out something that just begs to be mentioned.  Just because a bunch of people agree on something, it does not necessarily make it so. That is a tid-bit from logic.  I am sure that you are saying to yourself, ""Well, but if all of my consensus folks are climate scientists, that allows me to depart from that little point, doesn't it?"" No, because, if you keep in mind a modicum of scientific process and testing integrity, you would remember that a diversity of thought process is a strength, not a weakness.  Also, if there is a mistake or contamination in either the people, experiment, process, etc., then having an outside set of eyes for evaluation and checking on the process and results is a really good idea. Second, the magic 97% of climate scientists number is a spurious claim and you no doubt set up the 99% number honestly assuming you had the 97% accounted for.  The number showed up first in a 2009 survey paper from Univ. of Chicago graduate student Maggie Kendall Zimmerman that sent a 9 question survey to 10,000 area experts listed in the American Geologic Institute's directory of geoscience departments. She got 3,147 returns on the survey then published the answers to two of the questions: 1-Have mean global temperatures risen compared to 1800's levels? 2-Has human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures? Only 5% of the people that answered these two questions were actually climate scientists. The number ended up at 79 total climate scientists actually held this position with respect to these two questions.  This is clearly not 97% of all climate scientists, it is just the judgement of 79 scientists self-selected for interest in global warming, which makes them more likely than the entire population to hold a pro-global warming position. Another gentleman that helped to perpetuate this mythological number is Mr. John Cook, an Australian climate blogger.  In a Friday October 9, 2015 article of National Review written by Courtney Kirchoff, you can read about the methodology published by Cook.  I will give you a hint, it was completely subjective.  Here is a bit on that from the article: ""In 'Science and Education' in August 2013, for example, David R. Legates (a professor of geography at the University of Delaware and former director of its Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.0 percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent—had been found to endorse” the claim that human activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils- Axel Morner, whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work."" Another link regarding this issue is: http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/mike-ciandella/2014/01/23/misleading-97-percent-scientists-claim-resurfaces-ny-times Second (I will make this response shorter), you may have accidentally committed a change in my focus.  I don't doubt that the climate changes, the two questions are: 1-Is the planet warming to catastrophic levels? 2-Is this due to human behavior? Anybody knows about the little ice ages, the big ice ages, and the corresponding rises and drops in temperature.  Surely you don't think that there has been NO change before the 20th century? Third, I am glad that you brought up who pays for these sorts of studies.  It saves me from being a bad guy. You do realize how scientific studies get funded, right?  You have written grants to institutions that are willing to give you money for a particular direction of study and experiment, I hope?  Then you are aware of the inherent bias to this process and why these sorts of studies have to be carefully scrutinized in regards to their methodology because the customer (the funding institution) payed for a particular study outcome, and if the outcome does not end up the way that the customer wanted then the grant is not renewed.  If the study DOES come out how the customer wants, then the customer continues to pay.  Take a look at this link: http://marshall.org/climate-change/funding-flows-for-climate-change-research-and-related-activities/ Note, that this does not mean that the study is necessarily false.  It could still be valid, with good premises, a valid process, and with important findings.  The only trick is that you need to conduct the due diligence of oversight, critical oversight. In conclusion, that is the problem.  If you are telling me that 97% of all professionals in a given industry all agree on some theory that cannot be lead pipe locked, then I doubt your numbers. 97% sounds more like a Cuban election return than free and open debate.  YOUR claim is in unilateral correctness, not mine.  YOU are advancing the position that is bought and paid for, that is how you claim 97%. That is what I am afraid this is, a railroading of the actual scholastic process.  97% of people don't agree that the Holocaust took place, let alone a debated scientific theory.  No adult can reasonably believe that 97% agree on such a controversial issue, be a bit more critical.",UCUzSsrhrCL66JPAO0MLo4Mg,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

As you may be aware, urban sprawl is a very real thing.  This does not just effect forestation and wildlife however, it also moves blacktop and concrete out into what were rural and forest land. It has commonly been the practice by good thinking people to place weather stations away from high concentrations of blacktop and concrete because it tends to store heat, giving falsely warmer readings for longer periods of time during a 24hour measuring cycle. When sprawl or new development, like an airport, strip mall, etc., expand out to where weather stations are taking readings, the stations integrity of their reads are compromised.  It is unfortunate, but it happens.  Not every weather station is dutifully relocated because of time, funding, or simply because people didn't realize that it was being encroached upon. Maybe you could tell me why in many of the historical temperature models presented here in these arguments why there is no deviation for the little ice age? As another little question, what about the predicted melting of the arctic ice caps by 2016 as is indicated in this article: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/10/07/experts-said-arctic-sea-ice-would-melt-entirely-by-september-201/ Please, the dialogue in this thread was actually getting good with real go between, don't ruin it by not reading the posts and getting crass.",UCUzSsrhrCL66JPAO0MLo4Mg,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Additionally, recent research from Genographic Project / The Development of Agriculture nationalgeographic.com, places prehistoric seedless figs in the Jordan Valley, suggesting that fig trees were being planted some 11,300 years ago. This places current climate compliant agriculture in the Levant when the chart indicates an average temperature of just above -1 degree Celsius.  I find this difficult to square. 4-The earliest writing was only off by about 250 years.  The original Mesopotamian writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts.  It is important to keep in mind however that writing in the forms of tokens were found in Persia as early as 8000 BC.  Archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat determined the link between previously uncategorized clay tokens, the oldest of which have been found in the Zagros region of Persia, and the first known writing, Mesopotamian cuneiform. This can be found in, Rudgley, Richard (2000). The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age. New York: Simon & Schuster. pp. 48–57 5-There is a period that looks curious from 1500 BC to 1000 AD.  There is basically no change over 2500 years.  6-During the rise of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the usually cold, parched steppes of central Asia enjoyed their mildest, wettest conditions in more than a millennium. It is thought that as a result, a rapid increase in the number of war horses and other livestock significantly enhanced Mongol military strength.  This is according to: Neil Pederson. ""Pluvials, droughts, the Mongol Empire, and modern Mongolia"". This does not square with the period indicated to have temps drop according to the chart. 7-The temperature projections into the short future are interesting.  The chart indicates a radical increase in temperature during the 20th century.  The EU Brussels report recorded only a small increase: ""During the 20th century, Europe experienced an increase in average annual surface temperature of 0.8°C""- this is from p. 5 of the EUROPEAN COMMISSION, EU ""THE CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGE FOR EUROPEAN REGIONS1"", Brussels, March 2009, This is funny because if you work that out, it means that Europe warmed 80 degrees C during the 20th century, that seems toasty... or it means that over the 20th century the temp rose .8 degrees C.  A number like that seems a bit more reasonable. Either way, I find that the modeling is a little bit difficult to believe.  Have you done the math on the IPCC numbers?  Try squaring them with what you can actually put your finger on solidly.  I am concerned when we begin to remove things that we empirically knew to be true when it does not fit the narrative.  The Wegman Report, ""digitised"" from ""the temperature profile as presented in the IPCC Assessment Report 1990"", was shown to support claims that the cycle of Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age that was widely recognized in 1990 has disappeared from the MBH98/99 analyses. Doesn't this sort of revisionism worry you at all? ",UCUzSsrhrCL66JPAO0MLo4Mg,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The guy is not responsible for any climate change. He had arguments against it and he provided them. After that, people like me can read and make up their mind.

Reducing greatly the consumption of oil, gas and so on. So In this scenario all industries would loose!!!

Our studies show that globally, volcanoes on land and under the sea release a total of about 200 million tonnes of CO2 annually. This seems like a huge amount of CO2, but a visit to the U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) website (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/) helps anyone armed with a handheld calculator and a high school chemistry text put the volcanic CO2 tally into perspective. Because while 200 million tonnes of CO2 is large, the global fossil fuel CO2 emissions for 2003 tipped the scales at 26.8 billion tonnes. Thus, not only does volcanic CO2 not dwarf that of human activity, it actually comprises less than 1 percent of that value.",UCJHRxgx7yXwHHboOA1gsAZA,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

IMHO, if someone wanted financial benefit, he would be brain-dead to join ""green movement"" instead of oil/coal industry. For example, see Arab nations and their oil-based GDP rocket growth. Why there are none wind/solar-based GDP rocket growth? Where are the huge financial benefits? - Who of ""green movement"" states it is the end of times? IMHO they just state there is a problem. - Even if warming is not happening it is still a fact humanity pumps many chemical compounds in the air, soil, water. That´s dangerous in closed system. It´s not only about CO2, there are many more man-made substances which support greenhouse effect. So CO2 cycle has many ""siblings"" which do the same. But at the same time, CO2 is not only responsible for increase of the greenhouse effect, it also acidifies world oceans which is a problem too because of marine life (foodchains from plankton to people etc.). So the problem is much broader. - Better to raise false allarms which are scientifically founded (although you call it beliefs) than to be scr.wed when sh.t hits the fan. Or are you so sure of your ""truth"" to put your ultimate survival on it? - We´re not living in medieval times to fear the ""doom of being labeled deniers"".

During the 1970s and 80s, many of the identical scientists were pushing global cooling and overpopulation as the things that would cause the end of the world as we know it.

This has obviously not come to pass.  We have way more people, better fed, and now the concern is warming.  This is obviously done because people financially benefit from the industry.  There are those that have built industries on scares regarding war, racism, homophobia, environmental collapse, the Rapture, ""safety"", and ""organic"" goods and services.  This is how you got sold and joined a movement.

So volcanoes can't be the cause if their activity is not rising. Additionally, there are weather stations everywhere. Even in the middle of the sea. And there are satellites that measure the temperature of the whole earth. And those measure very isolated parts of the world far away from any city. Also, I live in Spain (One of the places where climate change is said to effect more) And here, we used to have ice wells. We stored ice from winter in a hole and it lasted all the summer, on the Mediterranean. Now it would be so impossible to even bring ice to those wells without a refrigerated cabin. Also, we used to have natural water wells just 3 to 4 meters deep. Now they are all absolutely dry all year long. This summer has rained so little that old trees are dying. And the ones that survive have the smallest fruits ever. Where I live, this august has rained as much as 0. So don't tell me that the video is wrong and climate change doesn't exist, just because is not affecting you yet. And by the way, the world is bigger that the united states. The fact that it has being a mild summer means absolutely nothing. Because I can tell you that in Spain we are breaking new records of max and average temperatures almost every month. Now, about your latter comments. Those papers are clearly looking for a way to prove that humans have nothing to do with climate change. Because they never even consider that possibility. And everybody knows that if you look for a correlation long enough, you will find something that seams like a strong correlation just by pure chance. Like Ockham said, the simpler answer is almost always the good one. Another ting that people like you that try to say that climate change is natural forget is the speed of the worming. Yes, in the past there were global wormings, and they took thousands of years, not decades like now!!!!

While our pollution might make a small difference it still could be so minuscule that a few years w/o humans could completely reverse its affect. China for instance has had alerts for how bad the pollution is in the air yet was able to get a blue sky back in less than a month of shutting down factories and banning cars from the road. ( this was done to get clear skies for a parade in Beijing) While I do believe global warming is happening, I think we're just affecting it more so than directly causing it.",UC2SOnl2fh864XLIP02-LuUQ,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

His point was that human CO2 emissions couldn't possibly be causing increase in CO2 concentrations, by listing the massive total amounts of CO2 sequestered in various sources (ocean/earth/etc). That's a ridiculous conclusion to make, akin to saying that a hose can't fill a swimming pool because there's an ocean nearby with much more massive amounts of water in it. Where is the actual research that supports your conclusion that volcanic activity causes more CO2 emissions than human activity? Oh right, it doesn't exist.

You made the point, ""The Earth doesn't warm because we're ending a long cool period. That's backwards. The long cool period ended because the Earth is warming. Unless you have some peer reviewed research which indicates that the Earth should be warming due to natural causes, it's just speculation and, again, assuming your own conclusion."" This point in itself is completely unsupported.  Yes, the aberrant Ice Age is a departure from the normal.  The Earth does undergo a normal cycle along a more geologic time clock, not since the 19th century.  Also again, the opinion piece is significant because I submitted him as a field expert.  There are hermeneutic assumptions when speaking from a geologic perspective which you are expressing an ignorance of, one being the cycle of ice ages and temperature fluctuation. Additionally, the accurate, systematic measuring of temperature for the purposes of predicting of future climate is a recent thing.  Because some guys in the 19th century took a thermometer out and got some readings is fine for generic data but not for mathematically intense climate modeling.  Another of your claims was this, ""Again, this person clearly has no understanding of the relevant science. First, climate models don't predict when El Nino's occur. Second, the Earth hasn't cooled in the 21st Century. Again, feel free to post actual citations if you disagree, but based on how is going I doubt you will."" This is incorrect based on the citations that I provided in my last post regarding NOAA's data findings.  Please feel free to review them at your soonest convenience.  NOAA research does include the repeated El Nino and La Nina events, it is part of the continual cycle of events.  Not including those two regular events would be like comparing sales numbers without including the unusual ""Christmas Bounce"" every holiday season.  Their contributions to the overall environmental effects are included in the data. I did notice that you did not touch on any of the other citations or scholarly, peer review articles that I provided.  Thank you.  I am glad that I could provide you with pertinent research for you to pay it no heed.

Also, just looking through the letter shows extreme misunderstandings, and logical inconsistencies. A few highlights: ""To argue that temperature has increased 0.8ºC since 1850 is misleading because the Little Ice Age ended in 1850 and it is absolutely no surprise that temperature increases after a long cold period."" This statement is laughably illogical. The Earth doesn't warm because we're ending a long cool period. That's backwards. The long cool period ended because the Earth is warming.

This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014). Corresponding transition matrices of both data sets appear similar and it is qualitatively evaluated by high values of 2-dimensional correlation found between transition matrices of ENSO and Sunspots. The associated transition diagrams show that each state communicates with the others. Presence of stronger self-communication (between same states) confirms periodic behaviour among the states. Moreover, closeness found in the expected number of visits from one state to the other show the existence of a possible relation between Sunspots and ENSO data. Moreover, perfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can help to explore the information about the related variables. This study can be useful to explore the influence of ENSO related local climatic variability. —– Gray et al., 2016 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.2782/abstract - See more at: http://notrickszone.com/skeptic-papers-2016/#sthash.JEeSz0md.dpuf",UCUzSsrhrCL66JPAO0MLo4Mg,1,Ugip-szpgrvGHHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

It's a totally misleading statement and not true to the facts. Do you know what question was actually presented to the scientists? It turns out that the scientist agreed that humans are contributing to climate change, note, there was no consensus as to how much we contribute to the total, nor that we are the major cause. Back in the kate 70's it was all doom and gloom that we were heading for an ice age as the world average temperatures had been falling for 30 years, and if you were around then you would know the winters were certainly colder. Then in 1979 the weather patterns changed, and agree years later it was WHOOPS, maybe not, as the temps were warming again. We then called it global warming. But WHOOPS again, then in the 2000's the temperatures started to flatten out, so we had to rethink it again.

They should give you a basic idea of what's important about clouds: “Water vapor and clouds are the main modulators of the earth radiation budget (Houghton 1990). In case of a naturally or anthropogenically produced beginning of climate warming, their dependence on surface temperature and the way they affect radiation fluxes at the top of the atmosphere can thus be the primary drivers of huge climate feedbacks.” (Source 6, Introduction paragraph 1) “By reflecting solar radiation back to space (the albedo effect of clouds) and by trapping infrared radiation emitted by the surface and the lower troposphere (the greenhouse effect of clouds), clouds exert two competing effects on the Earth’s radiation budget. These two effects are usually referred to as the SW and LW components of the cloud radiative forcing (CRF). The balance between these two components depends on many factors, including macrophysical and microphysical cloud properties. In the current climate, clouds exert a cooling effect on climate (the global mean CRF is negative). In response to global warming, the cooling effect of clouds on climate might be enhanced or weakened, thereby producing a radiative feedback to climate warming. “In many climate models, details in the representation of clouds can substantially affect the model estimates of cloud feedback and climate sensitivity. Moreover, the spread of climate sensitivity estimates among current models arises primarily from inter-model differences in cloud feedbacks. Therefore, cloud feedbacks remain the largest source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity estimates.” (Source 1.a, paragraph 1 & 2) “Global climate is very sensitive to even slight changes in clouds and radiation, hence requiring very precise measurements of variations in these parameters. For example, an instantaneous doubling of CO2 (100% increase) would produce about a 4 W m–2 reduction in outgoing radiation flux, which is less than 2% of the 235 W m–2 in global mean outgoing radiation. Since the trend in CO2 concentration over the span of a few decades is much smaller than a doubling, the trend in ERB [(Earth's radiative budget)] is also commensurately much smaller and thus even more difficult to detect. Such seemingly minor departures from radiative balance, when sustained over decades, could nevertheless produce changes in global temperature and climate sufficient to have substantial effects on human society and natural ecosystems. […] “Small cloud changes are important because they can exert more leverage over ERB than equivalent changes in greenhouse gases. For example, a 15–20% relative increase in low-level cloud amount is presumed to counteract the radiative forcing caused by a doubling of CO2 (Slingo 1990). Lowlevel marine stratocumulus and summertime midlatitude frontal clouds have an especially large negative net CRF and impact on ERB because, unlike the case for tropical deep convective clouds, their SWCRF is much greater than their LWCRF (Ramanathan et al. 1989). In contrast, optically thin high-level clouds have a positive net CRF because they strongly reduce LW emission while transmitting SW radiation. Since various cloud types have strikingly different radiative effects, it is not a simple matter to determine the overall global impact of cloud changes; each cloud type and climate regime must be examined in particular. Moreover, alterations of cloud albedo, cloud emissivity, and cloud height can affect ERB even when cloud amount remains the same. Since insolation strongly effects the magnitude of SWCRF, shifts in the latitude or seasonal cycle of clouds can change ERB even if mean cloud amount and cloud properties do not change. To detect long-term variations in their properties and radiative effects, clouds must be monitored with precision everywhere around the globe.” (Source 2, Importance of Small Cloud and ERB Changes and the Difficulties in Measuring Them, paragraph 1 & 2) “Determination of the aerosol climate forcing requires measuring the aerosol physical properties and how those properties are changing. This is analogous to how climate forcing by greenhouse gases is determined. We cannot determine the greenhouse gas forcing by measuring the radiation within the atmosphere or from a satellite – there are too many factors that affect the radiation field, including climate changes, cloud changes, etc. Instead we measure the changes of CO2 , CFCs and other gases. We then compute, from basic physics, the climate forcing with an accuracy of better than 15 10 percent; even higher accuracy is possible, but not essential.” (Source 4*, 13.6.2, paragraph 5) “The Arctic appears to be the most climatically sensitive region of the world… In addition, polar clouds strongly influence the present climate and presumably will do so in the future, when greenhouse forcing is expected to produce the largest climate changes in boreal high latitudes.” (Source 3, Introduction paragraph 1) “The changes in cloud radiative forcing suggest that cloud changes are a positive feedback annually but negative during the summer.” (Source 3, Abstract) “Over cold ocean regions associated with low-level stratiform cloudiness, the SW component of the cloud radiative forcing dominates over the LW component (Figs. 15 and 16), and the seasonal or El Niño/La Niña changes of the CNETwith SST have the same sign as dCSW/d SST (Fig. 17). This corresponds to a positive radiative feedback. Over warm ocean regions, there is a large compensation between LW and SW cloud forcing changes, but dCNET/d SST is still slightly positive. This also constitutes a positive feedback. When SST changes are not associated with large-scale vertical motion changes (case III), the thermodynamical influence of SST on the detrainment height of deep convective clouds amplifies the LW cloud-forcing sensitivity. This leads to a weaker compensation between dCLW/d SST and dCSW/d SST, and, therefore, ĨCNET is slightly larger than ICNET (Fig. 17). In the absence of large vertical motion changes (e.g., as for a uniform warming of the tropical ocean), dCNET/d SST over tropical ocean is thus slightly more positive than that actually observed during seasonal or interannual variations.” (Source 6, “5. Local relationships between SST, clouds, or radiation”, last paragraph) “It is not controversial to state that climate models are deficient in terms of tropical variability in the atmosphere on many timescales and a more realistic simulation of ENSO events in coupled simulations remains a high priority for model developers. During El Niño, the warming of the tropical eastern Pacific and associated changes in the Walker circulation, atmospheric stability, and winds lead to decreases in stratocumulus clouds, increased solar radiation at the surface, and an enhanced warming so that even models without ocean dynamics are capable of emulating some ENSO-like variability. Positive cloud feedbacks in observations have been shown to occur in association with ENSO and these variations are generally not well depicted in models, but challenges also exist for diagnosing these interactions in observations, as it is difficult to identify cause and effect in the context of multiple interactive variations.” (Source 9*, Concluding Remarks, paragraph 1) “The cloud–climate feedback averaged over the east Pacific region has also been calculated from SRES A1B simulations for 16 AR4 GCMs. The GCM feedbacks vary from −1.0 to +1.3 W m−2 K−1, which are all less than the +1.8 to +1.9 W m−2 K−1 obtained in the comparable iRAM simulations. The iRAM results by themselves cannot be connected definitively to global climate feedbacks, but we have shown that among the GCMs the cloud feedbacks averaged over 30°S–30°N and the equilibrium global climate sensitivity are both correlated strongly with the east Pacific cloud feedback. To the extent that iRAM results for cloud feedbacks in the east Pacific are credible, they provide support for the high end of current estimates of global climate sensitivity.” (Source 8*, Summary and conclusions, last paragraph) “We also must quantify the causes of changes of Earth’s energy imbalance. The two dominant causes are changes of greenhouse gases, which are measured very precisely, and changes of atmospheric aerosols. It is remarkable and untenable that the second largest forcing that drives global climate change remains unmeasured. We refer to the direct and indirect effects of human-made aerosols.” (Source 4*, 13.6.2, paragraph 1) “These analyses tend to confirm that aerosol forcing is large and negative, but cannot tell us what aerosols are causing the forcing, how much of the forcing is due to indirect effects on clouds, and how the aerosol forcing is changing. Aerosol climate forcing is complex (Ramanathan et al., 2001; Ramaswamy et al., 2001), in part because there are many different aerosol compositions distributed inhomogeneously around the planet. Different compositions have different effects on solar radiation, and, via their effects on clouds, they have different effects on terrestrial thermal radiation.” (Source 4*, 13.6.2, paragraph 4) “The large aerosol forcing derived in our present study implies that the aerosol indirect climate forcing exceeds the direct aerosol forcing, possibly by a large amount.” (Source 4*, 13.6.2 paragraph 10)",UCk62tY2svp9QVVMRIdfuzmg,1,UgjEvRH9aYKQC3gCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Just a few days ago the Gasoline & Automotive Services Dealers Of America executive director said “If Tesla can deliver on its current promises with the Model 3 gas vehicles are history—it’s horse and buggy days.“ Tesla just announced that they are now the fastest accelerating production car in history. Electric cars are maybe 10 years old and are already crushing combustion cars in just about every metric except range. And as for range, a recent study showed that 87% of vehicles never drive more than the range of an average electric car (source: http://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2016112).

Obviously higher efficiency = less panels and lower costs but, especially with residential solar, you can fit enough panels on a house to power it completely and the costs of the panels is actually only about 1/5 of the installation costs. I used to be a huge proponent of nuclear, and even wrote a 25 page paper on why it is the best option to combat global warming. However, the economics of renewables vs nuclear in the last 5 years has changed my mind about that. Projects like Hinkley C show that modern nuclear in today's post-Fukushima regulatory climate just can't be cost competitive with renewables.

We could use nuclear power but people are unreasonably terrified about it thus we can never really make it work. Not to mention nuclear waste is a bitch to get rid of. It will certainly lessen the strain no doubt. But it wouldn't fix the problem. The earth would still be moving towards becoming a heat trap, albeit much slower. But we can't just black out. That would pose a whole extra set of problems. All of our food would go bad, all of our running water would stop. We could never pull that off for more than a week without a mass uprising or anarchy.

China is in a tough spot. Their rapid growth started in the 1990s when renewables weren't cost competitive, so they've got a TON of coal plants built with more planned (though they just mothballed a bunch of plans and laid off over a million coal miners). However, since about 2010 they have been going nuts over renewables. It's not yet enough to displace legacy coal plants, but they're really doing a lot. Why are they doing this? Because the number 1 reason for social unrest in China is air pollution. The communist dictatorship is struggling to hang onto power and a side effect is cleaning up our environment. And as for the 'it won't help' attitude - the US made up 17% of global emissions in 2011, second only to China. The US moving to a zero would not only do a lot of good in reducing total global GHG emissions but it would signal to the rest of the world that the superpowers are willing to do something. My country Canada backed out of Kyoto because the US and China never ratified it. Now with the Paris agreement including them both, the rest of the world sees that collective action is happening. As the largest source of historic GHG emissions and the world's largest economy, the US has a responsibility to lead.",UCRM7We8N9I2tMAC7VQqCN1g,1,UggufF70S70kk3gCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

How can you discern truth for something that hasn't happened. 40:22 doesn't say sphere does it? It basically calls it a circle and it isn't even the main point of the paragraph. The Bible was written around 700 bc. There is evidence that the Egyptians knew the earth was a sphere long before that. It is to bad that Christians ran sacked the library at Alexandria. Who knows all the knowledge that was lost. The Bible is a work of fiction using other earlier cultures to explain to the Jews of the time their heritage and how they should live their lives. Only the Orthodox Jews really live that way anymore. If you really believe in the Bible then I suggest you read it and follow all the 600 plus rules that supposedly Moses set down.,UCirMu0XsCW-BNbvQEZgia4Q,1,UgirqtVvGpBeFngCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

6128,UgirqtVvGpBeFngCoAEC.8IAwdw4j4Ro8jwB32BiTGk,,0,2018-08-14 15:04:35,Roy Oetting,"The first thing you did wrong was believe in something Tyson said. Recently there was a lot of talk about the planets aligning. You have heard that, right? Tyson's comment ,paraphrased, what's the big deal, they line up every year. This is supposed to his field of expertise. He has a PHD in cosmology. Each planet has it's own orbiting time because they are at different distances from the sun for example Mercury takes about a quarter of a year to orbit the sun and Neptune is more like 170 years and of course time of orbit is about 365 days and we use that period to define a year. In other words Tyson was totally wrong about them lining up every year, wasn't he and if he doesn't seem to know his field of expertise why would anyone assume he knows anything about the climate. He like many of the supposed thousands of scientist who believe in anthropogenic warming take the word of relatively few like Hansen and Mann. Hansen and Mann have put their reputations on the line and are fighting tooth and nail for their academic survival. People like Curry and John Casey just to name two assumed the scientists were right but they did the smart thing and looked into the matter on their own. I can probably give you at least 10 reasons why the addition of anthropogenic CO2 is not a factor with regards to the change in climate and as many have pointed out it is changing and more correctly it has always changed. The simplest explanation I can give you is that we have just finished what is called by scientists is the Modern Grand Solar Maximum. Since the Dalton Grand Solar Minimum over 150 years ago the sun has other maximums and minimums such as the Glassberg Minimum at the turn of the 20th century and if you look at Earth's temperature during this time frame you would see a stair step effect of global warming. This begins long before the increase in CO2. Around 2007 we entered the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum and during the last 15-20 years with the exception of a few temperature spikes the temperature has leveled off. The IPCC calls this the ""pause"" which can not be explained since during this time CO2 has continued to increase. Scientists that are not held bent on proving that the rise in temperature is man's fault have found a number of factors that control the Earth's temperature as a factor of solar activity. Langley observed Solar radiation for a few years and is the author of the term ""Solar Constant"" which essentially means that the sun's output is relatively constant. If you were one the several hundred scientists/researchers tasked with proving the warming was caused by man and you were doing by the people paying you namely the UN then it becomes easy to say that solar activity is irrelevant. You could go on to conclude that it must be the increase in CO2 influencing the increase in temperature and when they do this they determine that the CO2's sensitivity of the climate must be quite high. They then use this sensitivity to write the computer models. The 70 or so computer models have consistently predicted much higher temperature increases. This is why IPCC's latest forecast is lower than the previous. Gees I got a lot more to say but most of you aren't interested or you just will disregard what I say because I'm not an X-Vice President who once to an ecology course. (did he pass?) One last thing the global warmers on not above lying to prove their point. The governor of California recently said the temperature was the highest in 15,000 years. Obviously he has been bum doped or he just likes to lie. The warmest this planet has been was back at the beginning of this inter-glacial period and the temperature has gone down since. Take into mind that this does not mean it has been a nice linear descent but a bumpy one. During the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum the temperature will go down, how abruptly this happens is anyone's guess. Expect crop failure, famine and disease like never witnessed on earth by mankind. Other critters have in the past. This is going to be something new for us.",UCirMu0XsCW-BNbvQEZgia4Q,1,UgirqtVvGpBeFngCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere exists in direct relation to the temperature. If you increase the temperature, more water evaporates and becomes vapor, and vice versa. So when something else causes a temperature increase (such as extra CO2 from fossil fuels), more water evaporates. Then, since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this additional water vapor causes the temperature to go up even further—a positive feedback. The idea of water vapor being a so-called greenhouse gas is patently absurd. As I have pointed out earlier, water in liquid and vapor form acts as a buffer of heat due to the high Latent heat of Evaporation of water and high specific heat of water vapor. Which means H2O can prevent the temperature a place with large open water from getting too hot or too cold compared to a place with no large open water such as a sand desert. More water becomes water vapor when the sun is strong does mean more water becomes water vapor. But more water vapor formed also means more heat has been absorbed. Latent Heat of Evaporation of water would allow water to absorb heat without any rise in temperature and the large specific heat of water vapor means less rise in temperature than CO2 with the same amount of heat absorbed, the daytime temperature of a place with large open water can be kept low with large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere but a place with no large open water like a sand desert would become extremely hot in spite of having very little water vapor in the atmosphere. At night time the heat stored in the water vapor would be released to the earth, to the air and to space and the place becomes warm instead of cold like sand deserts do.

Here is the proof: This is NOAA's explanation for accepting the CO2 measurement at Mauna Loa observatory as global level of CO2 : ""The reason why it's acceptable to use Mauna Loa as a proxy for global CO2 levels is because CO2 mixes well throughout the atmosphere.

Whether CO2 can trap heat has nothing to do with the speed of light but the dispersion of heat has something to do with the speed of light as infrared heat from the ground can be absorbed by the clouds which in turn radiate the heat to places further away. CO2 does not have such mechanism for it to disperse at the speed of light like heat does.

Speaking of which you forgot about this thing called Winter. Most of the plants live where winter is severe enough that they have a limited growing season.

When H2O evaporates under the hot sun, water turns into water vapor first without rise in temperature because the heat is stored as Latent Heat of Evaporation in the molecules. When more heat is added to the water vapor, it's rise in temperature is slow because of water vapor's high specific heat. At night time, the heat stored in the water and water vapor is released back to the air and to space in the form of infra red to keep the night time warm instead of being cold like the sand deserts. Therefore water in its liquid and vapor form acts as a buffer of heat to keep the place suitable for life. Furthermore, the hotter the weather, the more water would evaporate and more white clouds would form. When more white clouds are formed, more sunlight is reflected back to space by the white clouds to reduce the heat retained by the earth. So H2O in the form of white clouds form a negative feed back with sun light to keep the temperature down. CO2 also forms a negative feed back with green plants in the presence of sunlight. The stronger the sunlight is, the faster photosynthesis is carried out and the faster the green plants would absorb CO2.

White clouds being able to reflect heat from the sun back to space water means places with open water can have their temperature regulated but not increased by water in its various forms. The specific heat of water vapor at 27 °C or 300 °K is 1.82(kJ/(kg K)). The specific heat of CO2 gas at 27 °C or 300 °K is 0.846(kJ/(kg K)). That means water vapor can absorb about 2.2 times more heat than CO2 gas when both rise in temperature of 1°C . That means water vapor can prevent day time temperature from rising rapidly much better than CO2 of the same mass. Furthermore, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is so low compared to water vapor that the effect of the minute amount of CO2 is almost eligible. At 50 % relative humidity and 27 °C or 300 °K there are 12 grams of H2O in 1000 grams of air. On the other hand, CO2 at 400 parts per million (ppm) (measured by volume) has 0.0004 cubic meter of CO2 in 1 cubic meter of air or 0.4 liter of CO2 in 1000 liters of air. 1000g of CO2 at 27 °C and 1 atmospheric pressure occupies 559 liters of volume.

The mass of 1000 liters of air is 1225 grams. Mass of CO2 in 1000 grams of air is 0.7156 gram x(1000/1225) = 0.5842 gram That means in 1000 grams of air, there are 12 grams of H2O but only 0.5842 gram of CO2. Not only CO2 can store much less heat per unit mass than H2O, there is about twenty times less of CO2 than H2O in the same amount of air by mass.

The ability of H2O to absorb a huge amount of heat WITHOUT RAISING IN TEMPERATURE as in the case of Latent Heat of Evaporation of liquid water and to absorb large amount of heat with little rise in temperature compared to CO2 as in the case of high specific heat of water vapor means H2O is able to keep the temperature of places with or near large open water low in the hot sun and keep the night time warm when the heat absorbed by water and water vapor is released.

Take a look around do some research and learn to live without most modern conveniences because they can't and won't last. Look for yourself and question people that tell you everything will be fine.   Most of the tech fixes they talk about can't be done any easier then reducing CO2 emission and we can't agree to that. So when some one says we can reflect the sun light coming to Earth. How do they plan on getting every one on Earth to agree to that?   Then there the CO2 removal farce. They tell us they found a material that's 1000x better at removing CO2 from the air than trees are. But who cares because we need to burn massive amounts of CO2 to make them and even if we wanted to we could never manage to make enough to reverse the damage we've already done. If removing CO2 from the atmosphere was easy we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. The trees and plankton would of kept up in the first place.   It goes on and on. Maybe they'll tell you every generation thinks they're the last. That is also BS. There's always a nut in every generation, but this time it's not just one nut. It's a whole scientific community.   I'm teaching my children to live of the land and letting them enjoy the toys of today because I doubt they'll have any of them in there adulthood.   Maybe I'm wrong so live, learn and see.

Were they wrong that the earth is warming up? Or was it that there is more going on as just rising temperatures and therefore changed the name to something more fitting? Honestly I don't get this ""first they called it global warming and now it is climate change"" argument. "" It's far too often that science is wrong and yet if you ever question it you're considered a nut."" Science works by observing something, making a hypothesis (prediction) and then testing that hypothesis through experiment. That means that more often then not they are going to be wrong. And the simple fact is that A lot of studies that are released are bad studies, especially in the social sciences. But science is still the best method we have of learning about our environment and the universe. ""of course 'climate change' is real"" Yep there is no real debate there although a lot of people seem to think that that is where the debate is. The problem is the rate at which the climate is changing. ""if you look at the evidence it's like throwing a rock in a lake and saying that's the reason the lake flooded over."" This video concludes that the only explanation we have for the increasing temperatures is the increased amount of CO2 and other heat trapping gasses in our atmosphere, They did not say if that is the vault of humans or not. The simpel fact is that we as humans are burning a lot of fossil fuels and thereby bringing a lot green house gasses into our atmosphere that have been stored in the form of oil, gas and coal for millennia. Is this a lot compared to what nature produces in CO2, Not really. But if we ignore the CO2 that humans bring into the atmosphere for a moment, the amount of CO2 that is added and removed is about the same. So there is a balance there. It is the CO2 we are adding that shifts that balance to the point where a lot of CO2 is added on a yearly basis. A little disclaimer here is that to say that CO2 is the only reason is the only reason, as I suggested in this comment, is to easy. But CO2 is a major contributer.

Creative destruction is way better than having jobs for something that is outdated and more dangerous. It's why there are mechanically operated drills and professionals working to extract oil, instead of young kids working to extract coal like in Great Britain in the 18th century. Viewing the world in black & white is the biggest failure of all, so on that note, the biggest problem with capitalism is its child: Consumerism and the pollution that follows it.

On the other hand renewables will actually benefit farmers more than most. Larger tracts of land for solar and wind power installations. Electricity used mostly in the day time, unlike domestic usage which is mostly at night, mean less need for battery storage. Any extra electricity generated over what is used on the farms can be sold back into the grid for profit. Methane can be produced on the farm from rotting leftovers from crops and possibly captured from cattle emissions.

The abuse and censorship does not pertain to simply any dissenting commentator there but to highly credentialed and respected climate scientists as well; Dr. Pielke Sr. has unsuccessfully attempted to engage in discussions there only to be childishly taunted and censored, while Dr. Michaels has been dishonestly quoted and smeared. The irony of the site's oxymoronic name ""Skeptical Science"" is that the site is not skeptical of even the most extreme alarmist positions. John Cook is now desperately trying to cover up his background that he was employed as a cartoonist for over a decade with no prior employment history in academia or climate science.

To whatever degree global warming is anthropogenic, changes in the economics of energy and technology will soon render the whole 'debate' utterly moot. Government talk about 'doing something' is smoke and mirrors. The world is industrializing. The world's poorest are quickly catching up to the wealthier countries. This means ultimately they will want air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, cars, all the accouterments of modern civilization, most especially including reliable electricity. That means demand for energy is going to be going up, not just a little bit, but a LOT. Any reliance upon fossil fuels (such as we mostly have today) for this energy is going to drive up the price of fossil fuels, again by a LOT. Simultaneously the price for solar generation and energy storage is dropping and dropping FAST, every year. Very soon, within just a matter of years, it will be the case that it will be cheaper to get power from solar than it will by building coal fired power plants. It is already the case that solar is cheaper for residential use in many parts of the world than it is to buy it off the grid. In twenty years for instance, virtually every car on the road will be electric, not because of any government program or any quantity of evangelizing by ecologists, simply because electric cars will be both better and cheaper than the alternatives. What to do about animal methane emissions is a different problem, but there too progress may find it's own answer. The world's population is likely to climb to around ten billion before it stabilizes and it will do so within the next twenty years. That much more demand for meat coming from that level of population having middle class industrialized expectations is likely to drive the price of meat far higher than most are willing to pay, which will both lower demand while also stimulating better technologies for it's production and more financial resources for making it more green.",UCKEhxqcM57tWV83m_OAdYLg,1,UgiKtVgVPt1mmHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

The problem is - our activities are unsustainable - we are depleting our resource base - mineral and biological alike. We should reverse this trend - not only become sustainable, but REGENERATIVE. How can we? By implementing a sustainable and regenerative design. That is - a conscious design and maintenance of cultivated ecosystems that have the diversity, stability, and resilience of a natural ecosystem. To do that we should bring our activities in accordance with three 'ethics' of sustainability : 1) Care About the Earth : it's our home, and the only one; if we can't make a decent living on this planet - how can we even dream of colonizing another, for example?; 2) Care About the People : people is what we are, it is the future of our species, and if we are to reestablish healthy genetic diversity (which we had lost circa 70 000 YA) - we cannot have anyone being less than 'thriving'; also oppression and dispossession would do no good in the long run anyway. And sustainability is all about long run; 3) Fair Share / Obtain the Yield : this is about humans and nature alike - we are to take only what is in abundance, available after all the necessary needs of the productive systems are met - environmentally and economically, human and natural. But these are merely guidelines. How do we implement these guidelines? We stick to several principles. These are different in different settings, most sustainability designers and educators have their own, but some are pretty common: 1) First one - as it is among the most important : *Produce No Waste*. - there is no 'away' to put stuff. Remember - we are talking sustainability here, and it's about fairly lengthy periods of time. If you know not what to do with the by-products of your activities - stow it. Also expect no one to be so kind to manage your waste for you. Especially the following generations. That's why we are so strictly against nuclear - we (and our kids for that matter) ALREADY have to deal with a HUGE pile of hazardous waste (and, despite all that talks, we DON'T KNOW HOW, and if we do - then doing so would make all the fuss of no economic sense). Nice, isn't it? Do you think your kids would be thankful if you force even more of it on them? 2) Use and Value Renewable Resources. Renewables are SUSTAINABLE (since - SURPRISE!! - these are renewed all the time). 3) Plan For the Disaster : disasters are the real tests to the systems' sustainability - if a system can withstand a disaster - it is truly able to sustain itself in the long run. But how to design for it? Next principle will tell us : 4) Use and Value Diversity - if one element fails, other elements with similar properties can support the failed one's function. That brings us to the next one: 5) Not All Eggs In One Basket : Important functions must be provided by several different elements. 6) Use Small Scale, but Intensive Systems : remember that line - ""Buy land - they are not making any more of it anymore""? And that is true - we only have so much land to operate on, so to be able to sustain ourselves - we have to be very efficient at using space. But also we need to keep our systems relatively small - i.e. 'human-scale' - that way we have better grasp of the situation, and it just feels better that way, you know... Small is beautiful. And to achieve that small-scale efficiency we need : 7) MULTI-FUNCTION - each element performs several functions to the system. That way we save space, and probably energy 8) Use Edges And Value the Marginal - edges and borders are where the most activity and productivity takes place - borders between soil and air, land and water, woods and plains, and we should use it to obtain the surplus 9) Observe and Interact - since most of us (frankly, nearly ALL of us) have to learn it from scratch, and even if not - any intelligent design starts with careful observation - that way we get to know how nature in this particular area 'works'. And by applying small changes - interacting with the area - we learn our way. If a system is to be sustainable - it has to be VERY well-designed. And good design needs fine tuning, since it is very specific. And for that we need : 10) Use Small and Slow Solutions - small to be manageable, and slow - allowing to be carefully observed and mindfully interacted with 11) Apply Self-regulation and Accept Feedback - it's very fine to tune a system, but still it's better if it does it by itself, at least to some extent. Also to know what's going on a designer has to be aware - by accepting feedback. 12) Creatively Use and Respond to Change - the only thing that is constant is : change, so to be sustainable we have to be able to respond to it to our advantage We should all learn at least the basics of sustainable and regenerative design. What's good about it - is that all of us and everyone of us can start right from where we are at the moment, and gradually make our way into sustainable future, the one of abundance. We just have to decide that we are going to do it. Observe, interact, discuss it, make it done!",UCVUJw3ktsDwT9OY7XE20Sog,1,Ugh_Hae-cs7S0ngCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

I'm sure you'd agree that local temperatures can differ from global temperatures, so the way your local climate acts probably doesn't emulate what's happening globally. In this, fewer or 'more' clouds aren't required for cloud cover to create climate change; they can change in altitude, latitude, longitude, density, height, formation... etc. Not to mention, clouds are tied to water vapor and can enhance or nullify it (along with all other greenhouse gasses), making their influence all the more potent than it already is. Have you heard that clouds are the most important uncertainty in climatology, and that they have most-likely contributed much, if not most of the global warming? It seems to be that the global climate is much more sensitive than previously thought, thanks to this changing cloud radiative forcing, so CO2 increases will ultimately be far more dire.",UCk62tY2svp9QVVMRIdfuzmg,1,UgiEtRTqGki9dHgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

I suspect that the graph you have is a graph which was taken from a climatology paper and then modified in dishonest way to promote scepticism of climate science (this is a very common phenomenon). I will try to see if I can find the original graph so that you can see what I am talking about. Unforturnately we live in a world where there are organizations which have been funded (by the fossile fuel industries) to deceive the public by manufacturing doubt (often in dishonest ways). It is very wide spread and while I find it unusual that such a modified graph has made its way to a university homepage, it isn't too surprising that such a graph would make its way to a homepage of a professor who does not specialize in climatology. In the meantime if you are sceptical about, such graphs being modified for doubt manufacturing purposes, then I think you should have a look at this video. This link shows a video, that educates doubt manufactures on how to manipulate and change graphs from climatology papers for the purporses of doubt manufacturing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb1oAwwBWTE have fun watching it.",UC_NlA1tUXHnYMjOsd3gjkZw,1,UgjkRfzY6AyRAXgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

I think you would do well to read the articles I put up and notice that I didn't make any mindless catastrophic predictions! You are very true that so far humanity has worked successfully to improve their lot in life and in the process it has also occurred that we have driven over 300 species to extinction, and many more would be on the way had we not taken action and stopped ourselves from killing them, alongside efforts to keep them safe for the future! And no, just one species may not seem like much, even 300 is just a small portion of all the life in earth, but in think you will also find that any species is very important to its environment. Just look up how the wolves of Yellowstone extinction affected everything from aspens to riverbeds, or whales and their importance to the oceanic ecosystem! http://www.seeker.com/humans-caused-322-animal-extinctions-in-past-500-years-1768850883.html http://www.livescience.com/47733-humans-destroy-earth-biodiversity.html I wish I could confront your assertion that the UN predicted so many deaths and refugees from climate change by 2015, but I can't find anything to prove that that assertion was ever made by the UN or that it was ever predicted at all. A source would be wonderful. Finally, there have been many predictions that have not come true about climate change, this is very true, that's likely because so many predictions are being made, the true ones are generally ignored, such as sea levels rising and CO2 levels in the air, because they aren't exciting or spectacular. Usually it requires a bit of cherry picking, or outdated information to find these wrong predictions, though I won't say that there aren't any now. I do believe that the big problem with finding incorrect predictions is not that the scientists were incorrect, but that people are looking for statements like ""the Philippines have disappeared under the water today due to global warming"" rather than the actual stats. http://www.universetoday.com/94468/1981-climate-change-predictions-were-eerily-accurate/ https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/27/climate-change-model-global-warming Sorry for the huge amount of text, this is a big subject after all!

With basic (garbage) food meals for animals, and small, closed farms holding tons of animals, methane levels get high. Like look at corn vs grass. When say a cow eats corn, it produces more methane than one eating grass. But the reason they eat corn is because it's cheaper. If you were only looking for profit, would you do the thing that lets you use less land, and less cost, or the one with the exact opposites, so you're stock won't fart that much? Corn = More money Grass = Less environmental issues I think that there should be more regulations on livestock meals, how the animals are treated, and outputs of methane and carbon dioxide from farms. Also, I think hybrid (or hydrogen, when produced from electrolysis with water, rather than from natural gas) Right now, keep driving gas until it breaks, then switch to hybrid. Electric cars cost expensive materials to produce, meaning don't replace a perfectly fine car with it, as it's just a waste. Also, electric isn't that good for long distance or repetitive/constant driving. Gas is faster to charge up, and lasts longer, yet produces heavy amounts of Carbon Dioxide, so it's shouldn't be the main focus. Hydrogen is a good candidate for a cleaner fuel source, but the problem is that most of it comes from natural gases rather than water, so preferably, a solar or wind powered electrolysis ""station"" could fix that. All-in-all, hybrid cars should be the major type of car, but don't get one (If you don't have one already) until you lose/break your old car, or else you're just wasting metal and adding to a scrap yard when unnecessary.",UCbgFvi6oSEurEjvb9Fj2OUA,1,Ugj3trqs6iGWwngCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

We evolve our stomach using meat based diet + balanced diet with vegetables and fruits. The very fact you cant eat raw meat is the proof that we still using meat based diet to this day. Our stomach evolve to be more efficient and smaller because we changed our diet from eating raw meat to eating cooked meat.

We cant digest raw food like other primates and carnivores because our stomach already undergo evolution process. Our stomach is smaller and compact because we evolve eating using fire. Fire is one of the first human invention. By using fire, our food are much more safer because fire kills a lot of harmful bacteria. The negative side is fire/cooking cause certain mineral inside meat gone because it denatured with the protein. That is why we need to eat vegetables. Other species can produce their own vitamin C inside their body. But us human cant. So we supplement that with fruits and vegetables. So we need to eat good balance between meat, fruits and vegetable to be able to get all nutrients needed for our body for functioning. We cant just eat meat or just eat vegetables like a vegan proposed. Because our stomach is not design for that. Our canine teeth still available. Yeah it a little smaller than other primates, but because our stomach is smaller and with the help of fire, we don't need anymore very sharp teeth. We just need a good teeth to able to chew and eat only. It is hypothesize that the evolution of more smaller stomach, more efficient digestive track system, help to divert extra energy for development of our cognitive ability in our brain. The brain start to use more energy from our body to expand larger and producing much more synapses connection. The very fact we have flaws of our digestive track shows we still evolving from using previous primate digestive track that we inherited from long line of primates family.",UCLxuIs3bhJ3AFDWoRuRLtqQ,1,Ugj3trqs6iGWwngCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

Also, those fossil fuels took tens of millions of years to accumulate. We're digging it up a hell of a lot faster than that. *""Wouldn’t higher levels of co2 in the air foster greater plant growth, which would remove co2 from the atmosphere?""* Only to a limited extent. CO2 is not the only ingredient plants need for growth. If there isn't also an increase in water and soil nutrients, higher levels of CO2 won't matter much to them. If increased atmospheric CO2 led to an equal increase in plant growth and therefore their CO2 uptake, we wouldn't be seeing CO2 levels rising exponentially like we currently are. CO2 levels would appear to be constant, and we'd see increases in vegetation. Instead, Co2 is rising and plants seem to be faring no better than usual. *""Isn’t that a natural process?""* Again, human beings rapidly pumping massive amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere is not natural. Plants do naturally sequester carbon from the atmosphere, but they've had absolutely no reason to evolve the ability to do so at a rate that could even come close to compensating for the current activity of the human race, and so they decidedly don't have that ability. Nature isn't magic, and it doesn't give two shits about the comfort or survival of the human race (or any other species on the planet for that matter).

""_ This is only partially true. Overall, Antarctic ice sheets have decreased as well, save for one specific region of the Antarctic where changing climate has resulted in colder than usual temperatures and increased precipitation. It's also important to note here that newer ice is not as resilient as older ice, nor packed as densely. So it's important to not only look at the volume of the ice, but it's overall mass as well. But, taking the continent as a whole, temperatures have been rising and the mass of ice has been decreasing. _""Antartica is many times larger than the Arctic, hence the net change in ice caps has actually increased globally""_ This is just flat out false and, unless you provide me some citations, I'm going to guess that you've simply assumed is true. Virtually every major scientific institution that studies the ice caps have repeatedly shown that the amount of ice at the poles is decreasing. _""and adjusting for large urban areas sinking in relation to sea level measurements, real sea levels have not changed.""_ Sea levels aren't measured against just urban areas. Local sea levels are measured using tide stations (which are located all over the world, not just along the coasts of large cities) where local factors such as subsidence (what you mentioned would be an example of this), upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, variations in land height, and whether the land is still rebounding from the compressive weight of Ice Age glaciers are all taken into account. The average sea level is measured using satelite laser altimeters that measure the height of the ocean across the planet. That method does not require relating the height to a fixed point on land, and so local factors like subsidence don't change the results. _""That is why the state of Florida is not underwater along with many coastal areas.""_ But Florida's coastline has been changed due to rising sea levels. Groundwater has been increasingly contaminated with sea water, and coastal property has seen increasing flooding and damage during storm surges. Overall, Florida's coast is experiencing an increase in sea level of 1 to 6 feet per century, depending on the location (once again, this is measured in both urban and rural areas, and takes into account local factors that also effect local relative sea levels). Furthermore, I don't know who exactly you're trying to debunk here. I can't think of a single scientific study or institute which claimed that the whole state of Florida would be underwater by now due to rising sea levels. The absolute worst-case scenario that I've seen is that significant chunks of the state would be underwater by the next century if sea level rise continued accelerating as it has been for the last few decades.",UCMER_Q2-NTSX39LbFJdWTcw,1,UgjTMXnAOH83NXgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

So, back to the question: Money. That's the reason. Many fossil fuel companies (oil, coal, natural gas/fracking) will die out the way of steam engine combustion if the government pushes more incentives to more eco-friendly renewable sources of energy (solar, wind, hydro, geo-thermal), so the fossil fuel companies donate to (bribe) politicians' campaigns with the understanding that those politicians will create laws that benefit them rather than the newer renewable energy companies. They, politicians and fossil fuel companies, don't care about the long-term effects burning these fossil fuels will have on the environment (what good are jobs if we're all dead from an inhabitable planet?) because they'll be getting rich(er). A couple of fossil fuel companies are actually looking into shifting away from fossil fuels to renewable energy technology because they see a potential for more profits (a win-win for them and the environment), coupled with the fact that fossil fuels pollute the environment and WILL run out sooner rather than later, whereas, renewable energy is much more sustainable: As long as the Sun is burning, then hydro, geo-thermal and wind energy will always be available for us to harvest. Unfortunately, most of the other fossil fuel companies either don't want to risk investing into renewable energy or just flat-out don't want to change their business models. Some say that renewable energy is not as reliable because the technology is still developing, which could very well be true, BUT... that's where I think governments could help in the research and development of aspect of creating reliable renewable technology, then the companies can pay back the governments once these technologies are created. If governments can do it for banks (and if not mistaken, our government helped finance research and development for oil and coal companies when they were starting out), why not do it for renewable energy companies?

However, there have been numerous studies conducted to answer the question of how large the consensus is and what exactly climate scientists (and the scientific community at large) think about climate change. To find those studies, Google: _Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming_ (They find the 97% consensus figure to be accurate). _Expert credibility in climate change_ (They found that 97-98% of climate scientists who actively publish papers in the climate science field support the theory of serious man-made climate change). _Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change_ (They found that roughly 90% of scientists and 96% of climate scientists think that climate change is both real and man-made). _The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change_ (They found that out of 928 scientific papers published between 1993 and 2003 on the subject of climate change, 75% of them explicitly or implicitly agreed with the IPCCs conclusions on climate change. 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate and so took no position either way. 0 studies disagreed with the consensus that climate change is real, man-made, and serious). Between these 4 studies (and they're not the only ones done that have reached this same conclusion), 4,602 scientific papers (most likely published by multiple scientists) and 4,169 individual scientists would disagree with Alex Epstein. And unless all these studies are just total flukes, the actual number of scientists that would disagree with him is much, much higher. So I ask again, why should I take anything Alex Epstein has to say on the matter seriously? What makes him a more credible source than literally the combined efforts of thousands of scientific researchers?",UCMER_Q2-NTSX39LbFJdWTcw,1,UgjTMXnAOH83NXgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

He's a writer and a political pundit that runs a _for-profit_ think tank specifically designed to ""bring about a new industrial revolution."" He studied philosophy and computer science in college and has no formal training in the physical sciences beyond what he learned in a public high school. The fact that he is a New York Times bestselling author means jack shit. Snooki is one too, and I'm certainly not going to be asking what her opinion on the matter is. Secondly: here's exactly what he's said, ""If you look at the literature, the specific meaning of the 97% claim is: 97 percent of climate scientists agree that there is a global warming trend and that human beings are the main cause."" That is from an article he wrote for Forbes. At no point in that article does he quote climate scientists on how serious they think climate change is, yet he repeatedly implies that they think it's not serious. He presents the average temperature change, and makes a big deal of it being a small number despite never explaining the context of that number or what effect such a change (even if it seems numerically small) will have. He just calls it ""measly"" and leaves it at that. So what we have here is someone who knows nothing about climate science, has no experience within the energy industry (beyond the politics of it), and who's personal finances are almost entirely predicated on the continued existence and success of the fossil fuel industry. He makes no effort to quote climate scientists, even when making claims about what they do or do not believe, and presents scientific data with little to no context in order to persuade his audience to agree with his political agenda. What precisely makes you think that this man is in any way at all a credible source of information on this matter? That's not a rhetorical. What makes you put more importance on what this guy has to say than a climate scientist? Here are some scientific organizations that are of the opinion that climate change is real, man-made, and will have serious negative consequences: The American Physical Society The American Association for the Advancement of Science The Geological Society of America The American Chemical Society The U.S. National Academy of Sciences The Australian Academy of Sciences The Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for the Sciences and the Arts The Brazilian Academy of Sciences The Royal Society of Canada The Caribbean Academy of Sciences The Chinese Academy of Sciences The French Academy of Sciences The German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina The Indian National Science Academy The Indonesian Academy of Sciences\ The Royal Irish Academy Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (Italy) The Academy of Sciences Malaysia The Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences The Turkish Academy of Sciences The Royal Society (U.K.) Why should I take this guy's word (a political pundit specifically paid to oppose climate change legislation) over theirs (trained and experienced scientists currently doing the research into climate change)?",UCMER_Q2-NTSX39LbFJdWTcw,1,UgjTMXnAOH83NXgCoAEC,hphdsLcSTYQ,2016-08-29 17:25:39

You just see the number 2 and think, ""well that seems like a small number. Must not be that bad."" Meanwhile, people who know better are freaking the fuck out. Ask the Maldives if a 2 degree rise is a big deal or not. Ask Kiribati, the island nation that's basically going to have to evacuate their entire population pretty soon due to rising sea levels. Do you know what causes those rising sea levels? Melting polar ice. What made that ice start to melt? Rising temperatures. And do you know what the worst part is? The ice caps actually play a significant role in _cooling_ the earth through reflecting solar radiation back out of the atmosphere and absorbing heat energy. So as the ice melts, the earth will warm even faster, causing _more_ ice to melt, which will again cause the earth to warm faster, and round and round we go. Oh, and rising sea levels is only _one_ of the terrible side effects of an increase in average global temperature. In short; that 2 degree increase is a big deal. Even if you're only looking at it from an economic standpoint, it's not at all desirable.

Here's how it happened: Thirty million years ago, when CO2 levels dropped below 800 ppm (twice today's levels), plants freaked out and evolved C4 species to cope with the CO2 starvation levels. Fast forward to our current Ice Age, and during the last glacial period, CO2 levels dropped down to 180 ppm -- just 40 ppm above the ""red line."" At that level, all plant life on the planet would die. Shortly afterward, all animal life would die, because there'd be no more plants for food. Hooray for humans.
