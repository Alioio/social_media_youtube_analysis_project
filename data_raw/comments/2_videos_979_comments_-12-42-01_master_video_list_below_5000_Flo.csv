The Bible tells us that “the Former of the earth and the Maker of it . . . did not create it simply for nothing.” (Isaiah 45:18) The Bible also says: “The earth endures for ever.”​—Ecclesiastes 1:4, The New English Bible.

Yes, God will not allow the earth to be rendered uninhabitable. Rather, he will intervene in human affairs and bring an end to failed human rule and those who have no regard for the earth. At the same time, he will preserve alive all who lead morally upright lives and sincerely want to please him. Says Proverbs 2:21, 22: “The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it.”",UCW-_TRwcFIkafIiMvlKPH1Q,0.0,UgwsxF09XrnpRuxQOfR4AaABAg,lr-tBaFGRyg,2020-09-11T23:56:52Z,climate crisis

California's annual firestorms are not due to climate change.  California's climate hasn't changed in hundreds of thousands of years - perhaps in millions of years.  California's native grasses are the irrefutable proof that so-called man made climate change has nothing to do with these firestorms.  Even after multiple consecutive years of drought conditions in California, the native grasses in the state remain lush and green (only the non native, European grasses die off and dry up).  This is rock solid proof that the climate in California has not changed in at least hundreds of thousands of years - a non stop succession of wet and extreme dry periods in the state has resulted in the evolution of the native grasses (and some plants) for extreme drought tolerance.

Furthermore, California now contains several hundred times more trees than it would otherwise naturally contain.  Democrats have been planting trees all over the state for nearly a century while simultaneously suppressing wildfires - as well as refusing to manage the resulting dense forests that have since grown.  Meanwhile, the Democrats also refuse to appropriate California's tax dollars responsibly.  There has been no substantial build up of the State's firefighting capability - no fleet of super tankers for example, that the State should have purchased 3 years ago now.  Instead, Sacramento's Democrats purchased solar panels and trains to nowhere that nobody will use and free medical care and education for illegal aliens who should not even be there in the first place.

This firestorm problem is entirely the Democrats' fault - all of it.  The Republicans have no representation in California...if they did, this problem would never have become such a big problem.

Governor Nuisance needs to resign - along with all the Democrats in Sacramento.

And how is California's carbon footprint looking now?  NOT SO GOOD - all thanks to Democrats.  Can you believe these Democrats are issuing ""spare the air alerts?""  ARE THEY KIDDING?  It's going to take about 5 MILLION years of abiding by the Democrats' spare the air alerts just to get the Earth back to where it was BEFORE the Democrats burned California to the ground!",UCR_RqbCaullpBnVmhNwsS0w,0.0,UgzZkhpHYBWhSke6Cux4AaABAg,lr-tBaFGRyg,2020-09-11T23:56:52Z,climate crisis

""Time Has An End""
Time has an end, with much of God's word, the Bible, to comprehend, but most won't contend, and climate change won't mend; Global warming is God's final warning, as He is always in control, and He is our Weatherman (Isaiah 45, Nahum 1, Jeremiah 23....)Because of too much rebellion and sin, and wicked hearts within. (Jeremiah 7, Psalm 48, Romans 1-3...) God gave us His written word, originally in Hebrew and Greek, and called this book the Bible, to show us how to live and be; The Bible was written by holy men of old, many years ago, as God moved them through the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:21); And all scripture was written by inspiration of God, for us to be corrected, and reproved, by walking in His truth (2 Timothy 3:16,17); We have a most loving, and merciful God, to be praised and obeyed, from the moment we arise, til we go to sleep at night, yet much of the world won’t take heed, and go their own way; (Psalm 113:3, Ezekiel 39, Jeremiah 12, Ephesians 5, Titus 3, 2 Timothy 3..... ) He is the King of kings, LORD of lords, He is our Savior, Creator of all, but most won't even acknowledge Him, and mock Him with much gall; We’re in the “Great Tribulation” now of Matthew 24, the LORD has opened up the seals (Revelation 5-22), so we can see truth more; In Daniel chapter 12 vs 9, God told Daniel the seals were closed til the end of time; If you study from Isaiah to the book of Malachi, hopefully you will see that this is all about the end times; Too many false gospels, signs and wonders, none have the truth, since God has allowed Satan to take his seat in the temple, and now rules, according to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 (2 Corinthians 11, Revelation 2,3, 17-22)Judgment has begun on the house of God, in 1 Peter chapter 4, God is starting with the churches, and then to many more; (Ezekiel 9, Jeremiah 25...) God is our Faith, our Baptism, our LORD, and Father of all, and only He can save, not the pope, priest, you, or me, and none can come to Him, unless He draws, and only by His mercy; (John 6:44, 10:30, Ezekiel 36, Romans 1-9, 1 Timothy 2:5, Titus 3, Ephesians 1-5...)So as the days of Noah, because of too much sin, when the floods came, and took most everyone/thing away, except for the animals on ark, and Noah's family of eight, So shall our LORD and Savior, Jesus Christ (both the same), come and destroy this earth with fire on the dreadful Judgment Day, with only a remnant saved (Isaiah 1, 10, 11, Jeremiah 23, 31, Ezekiel 6, Joel 2, Malachi 4, Romans 9, 11, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, Revelation  11, 12, 18-22….), and He alone is the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2);Please come soon LORD Jesus, please come soon, let Satan and sin no longer rule, for many are suffering, more and more each day, especially the children, LORD we pray; Please come soon dear LORD, please come save (Revelation 18-22)

In fact, the big trees like Redwoods and Sequoias cold not survive without periodic fires burning out the underbrush that compete for nutrients.  ""Sunny California"" is so named because much of it is arid and and has low atmospheric humidity.  Every year, a phenomenon known as the Santa Ana Winds sweep through southern California. The problem in California is twofold: Man's encroachment into fire-based ecological zones has created a situation that is counter to nature.  Once houses go in to a wooded area, the homeowners do everything they can to suppress wildfires because who wants to live in a community with a bunch of charred tree trunks!  Secondly, this suppression results in a buildup of ""fuel"" for fires. There is also not enough effort done to clear out the undergrowth. Therefore, the fuel supply for forest fires is dramatically increased!  So when the fires do take hold they cause not only a dramatic increase in property loss value but also take more human lives. The Governor of California claims this is due to ""climate change.""  Again, he completely ignores California's basic ecology!  The reason there are more fires, more property loss, and more loss of life is because there are more human beings living where nature did not intend communities to be built.  Of course, to the intellectually lazy, ""climate change"" is a convenient answer.",UCGKF9W4L3jMcagH2ILHtwSA,0.0,UgyVFh4UGEmb73pVOVp4AaABAg,lr-tBaFGRyg,2020-09-11T23:56:52Z,climate crisis

https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_totalFires.html

Wow! would you look at that..... According to this research the number of acres burned was far larger in the 1920's and 1930's then it was in the 1990's and the 2000's.

One must wonder why the MSM and most information sites only show the statistical data for the years 1990's and 2000's. Could it be that if people saw for themselves that there were far more acres burned in the 1920's and 1930's that it would expose their false narrative for climate change?

Do you think you are born again just because you go to a church?  Not all churches declare the Truth. On the contrary, your church could be a completely worldly church.

If they get enough rain, then they don't have wildfires; instead they have mudslides.  If they aren't having fire or mudslides, then they are having earthquakes.   I have a newsflash for Governor Newsom and for Californians.   Those of us in the United States who are NOT Californians are sick and tired of hearing about the problems in California.  Guess what?  Other states have problems too, like Louisiana after hurricane Laura.  The difference between California and the rest of the country is that the rest of the country deals with their problems.  But in California, they don't deal with the cause of the problem or establish preventative measures, such as clearing out forest deadfall to prevent fire spread; what Californians do is look for a scapegoat.

A state that is overpopulated and has very limited natural water resources and that is greatly dependent on snow melt for water is going to be a tender box for at least part of the year.  Also building houses on hills and mountains that should have been left alone means that nature will take back what was once hers.  And the decades of huge amounts of traffic in the San Fernando valley and a state that literally gave us the word ""smog,"" really means that Californians need to take responsibility for their current problems.  Why doesn't Gavin Newsom acknowledge the REAL problem in California and that is that there are just too many people in California?  And he states the obvious that climate change is responsible and I just want to say to him, ""you think?""   Considering his state was a HUGE contributor to global air pollution, congested freeways, lack of water, and overpopulation, he needs to realize that the people in his own state have largely created their current situation.  And over zealous laws that are ridiculous like a law in California that says a person can't be discriminated against because of their hair style, is indicative of just how strange things are in that state and how out of hand the legislators have become.   And there are fires in California EVERY year and they keep getting worse and worse EVERY year and instead of trying to establish preventative measures Newsom looks for a scapegoat.  People who look for scapegoats are really ignoring their own responsibility for what has happened.   It is a troublesome and problematic situation, but it should be obvious as to the cause.  Too many people and not enough water means that nature will take back what belongs to her and she does so in this case by fire.  The really bad corollary to this situation is that Californians are leaving their state and then bringing their ""urban sprawl"" mentality with them.  Then they begin to ruin where they move to, such as Texas.

Wildfires are nothing new to Califonia, they have been going on since I have been born and evidence shows long before.  Blame climate change, but Califonia has no reason not to have proper systems in place to help prevent and slow these types of fires.

Fires Aren’t New. High temperatures, forest fires, and smoky skies also occurred in California in the nineteenth century. While fire suppression has allowed the build-up of wood fuel in California’s mountain forests, such as the Sierra Nevadas, big, hot fires burned in southern California’s chaparral or shrubland forests in 1889, 1919, and 1932, long before fire suppression.


The US Forest Service adopted a policy of fire suppression. President Teddy Roosevelt and his Forest Service chief, Gifford Pinchot, drummed up fears of timber scarcity in order to expand federal control over forests and to suppress fires.

Public support for fire suppression, including from California’s elites, grew in the 1920s and 1930s after forest fires wiped out 1,000 homes in Berkeley, and burned 60,000 acres in Malibu. 

Within half a century, scientists realized that fire suppression was a mistake. Vast amount of fuels had accumulated for 50 or more years. The fires became far bigger than what could easily be handled. So, It's not entirely climate change but a cycle of nature.",UCsBX1mM3NuF88gJd_IIBHQQ,0.0,Ugy2iqZvu3gD1PdP-6t4AaABAg,lr-tBaFGRyg,2020-09-11T23:56:52Z,climate crisis

This was the case from the early Earth and the percentages of each greenhouse gas always changes over time. All greenhouse gases on the planet have a natural origin. They include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. There is methane on Mars and their is CO2 on Venus, neither was caused by mankind as two examples. Of course animals on Earth exhale CO2 and plants use this gas for photosynthesis to produce oxygen. Currently CO2 is measured at only parts 400 PPM. Climate change advocates with a political origin falsely claim CO2 is causing our current issues on Earth. But in reality it is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others. We do know the water vapor through evaporation plays the biggest role because the Earth is covered with 70 percent by water. Plus the Earth being a sphere traveling around the sun which travels around the Milky Way galaxy etc.. etc has experienced many cycles over it’s life that have changed the composition of the atmosphere, the temperature, the sea level, wind and water currents.",UCGZtU1bCcADRyWeIUUQzCGw,1.0,UgyP0qB7IbG0wwFdzep4AaABAg,lr-tBaFGRyg,2020-09-11T23:56:52Z,climate crisis

Except there's a problem, emissions in western nations have fallen for years, while emissions in nations like China and India have skyrocketed. We can't do anything if the most populous places on earth continue to pollute in the way they do. 

There is also the issue of the fact that the temperature of the earth shifts over time and freak events have happened regardless of man-made pollution. For instance, the Great Frost of 1709 was an unprecedentedly cold year that led to famine and suffering across Europe. The level of industry at the time was nowhere near the levels of today.

Clearly, manmade cause are setting off the wildfires, such as arsonists. 

It makes sense because all our Demotard cities are burning to the ground too. And that's not caused by global warming either. It's the arsonists, stupid.

It's hard to appreciate if you weren't there but the layer of smoke from the fires kept the entire area so dark that we didn't experience.
