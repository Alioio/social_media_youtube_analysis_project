As to why we are not the greatest creators of co2? co2 increased from 280 to 410 an increase of 46%. There is evidence that there have been spikes of co2 of up to 350 ppm for as long as a century after some volcano activity. The spike we have is less barely more than half a century. This means we do not even know how much of the increase is man made. Yes it is very likely that the majority of it is man made, but we do not even know that.

BUT the majority of the problem isn't how much co2 has been added, but how SENSITIVE is the atmosphere to co2 change. Evidence is that it is about .5°c or less. No model what has its sensitivity set to less than 2°c will produce a disaster. Anything less than a 1° is pretty much a yawn.

So where is the warming coming from if not from co2? From glacial melt. Yes, you mentioned water on rocks and that is precisely the problem. The sun warms the rocks, and that passes the heat to the ice of glaciers and then increases the temperature to the same temperature of the ocean. The result is that the water absorb a lot of energy that would normally be radiated into space, but is trapped on the earth in the form or liquid water.

I understand how you people must be concerned with the perceived danger of Global Warming.

I have to tell you some truths and facts about what you are being told.

Bearing in mind, that in order to reduce the temperature of the world by limiting or abolishing the production of CO2, is a horrendously expensive task world wide.

This attempt in itself, regardless of what the climate is doing, can only lead to disastrous rises in the cost of energy which in turn will lead to economic collapse of world economies along with of course disastrous effects on the world populace.
 (Yup I majored in economics - class of 1981 - and for me this is easy to see). 

You see, our economies are based on fossil energy, Coal, Gas and Oil etc and unless equally or less expensive substitutes are found, without these things, most of us will starve and/or freeze to death.

But perhaps, as you are no doubt postulating on your site, if we are not going to ruin the planet, maybe the above cost will be worthwhile?

<b>So at the very least, trying to cool the planet is a very serious thing to attempt and I am sure that you would agree that  we should not go down this road unless we have absolute proof that humans are warming the planet and that the predictions we are hearing from some sources are scientifically confirmed</b>

Fortunately there is a scientific method which  allows us to decide whether the above is true or not.

If you read Karl Popper and  if you wish to take it even further, William of Ockham,  you can find the basis of the scientific disproof of a hypothesis.

This quick video may help.
Richard Feynman on disproving a hypothesis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6-x0modwY

And Dr Roy Spencer Graph showing Models and empirical measurements.
http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/CMIP5-73-models-vs-obs-20N-20S-MT.png

(The accompanying commentary for the above can be found on Dr Spencer's website archive Blogs June 2013)

This is a good example of Popper's disproval of a hypothesis. In this case the models are the hypothesis', (or law as Feynman describes them) and the actual temperature measurements, some of which are satellites, represent the empirical measurements.

<b> Therefore it is very obvious that the models fall under Feynman's rejection. There is therefore no scientific evidence that the earth is warming, (or cooling),  other than what has already been observed throughout history.</b>

Unfortunately, governments like excuses to issue new laws. As most governments nowadays, (including that of New Zealand), are sliding steadily to the left, this gives them an excuse to issue more laws and regulations of the sort which we must obey at the cost of trading a little of our freedom and democracy. We see this happening in our society at this very moment as common law is replaced with regulative legislation in most sectors. Common law traditionally is/was at arms length from governments. Regulations by legislation are not.

So please take the time to study these things. I understand how difficult it is to give up beliefs that you have accumulated, but one must remain logical and scientific in these things. To be otherwise one must be dishonest with one self.

Cheers

Roger

Also lay out a real plan for rebuilding infra. That would win many of Sanders supporters as many of them are sincere&intelligent. It is actually very easy to prove that we have changed the climate already(added 40% co2 since pre-industrial) There is for ex. no debate, if we have GG-gasses in atmosphere(co2 is the second largest contributor to that after water vapor and the total effect is 33C. Also co2 contributes roughly 10-20% to this phenomena), Gulf-Stream is stalled about South-Englands lattitude, North Poles ice melting is record high, methane is bursting from Alaska&Siberia&Arctic Ocean, resent draughts in Amazon, corals are near to experience huge collapse and also the whole ecosystem in the oceans(land also) is in tremendous risk to collapse. Just overturn republicans claims about climate change clearly and loudly. Paul Beckwith from University of Ottawa is very clear explaining matters concerning climate change. I""d invite Him to talk/debate climate change. He can see links between different matters very clearly and thus can explain&argue clearly also.

That science, which is a human endeavor, ""has made mistakes,"" which is to say that scientists, who are human beings, have made mistakes in pursuit of the truth within the context of science, does not negate all science, which is the thrust of your argument. You and I communicating with each other on the internet is a result of science. The fact that there are scientists some 45 or so years ago who ascertained incorrectly that we were heading toward a new Ice Age doesn't negate the fact of a fully functioning internet, albeit one that has its hiccups from time to time, nor does it negate the findings and conclusions climatologists and those scientists who work in and around the field of climatology today. 

What science and technology has learned over the last 45 years and is now capable of doing is almost beyond the imagination, and the know-how and knowledge it is attaining on a daily basis is growing at an exponential rate. What was once something that existed only in the realm of science fiction has now become science-fact. You're staking claim to what some scientists suggested 45 years ago.

NOPE. Factually wrong.

The two major ways 'climate-astrologists' have been wrong in the recent past were in the 1970s when they assured us there would be continued COOLING of the planet, and the current batch of failed weathermen who models have been dismal failures.

You just got off on calling me the same as a flat earther without any knowledge of my scientific understanding and background. You enjoy pissing on others because it makes you feel superior. Pathetic.""

If you're going to quote me, quote me correctly. I said, ""I have no dog in this race. I have nothing to gain by advocating that action be taken to address manmade climate change"" and then went on to say that I'm likely to live another 30 to 40 years, to my late '80's or late '90's, and that the impact of climate change will not affect me nearly as much as it will the people who are younger than I am. And that's true. 

You don't know me on a personal level and have no basis with which to accuse me of saying what I say because it makes me feel ""superior."" I say what I say because I want you and others to see that you are clearly mistaken. I want you and them to consider what I've said and, ideally, believe me and incorporate my thoughts and opinions with their own. 

My intentions here are noble and altruistic. I'm not so insecure as to have a need to ""piss on others"" in order to feel ""superior."" I look to others for information, knowledge and wisdom I do not currently have, which is completely the opposite of needing to ""piss on others"" in order to feel superior. I'm looking to make myself a smarter, better person, not stubbornly cling to some easily disproven and indefensible point of view. I think it is you who is the one with feelings of insecurity and inferiority, and frankly, you have good reason to be, since you have staked your claim on the wrong side of this issue - and the wrong side of history.

As per Google definition, fascism is ""an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization."" I am anything but right wing, nor am I an authority on climate change. I'm just someone with common sense - as I said before - who has looked at the evidence and listened to what people and scientists have said, and concluded that manmade climate change is real and not a hoax. I WISH it were not real; I wish this wasn't happening. But it is and denying it will only serve to make the consequences of climate change worse - far worse. 

I'm not nationalistic; I'm much more of a globalist, seeing as we're all part of one relatively small planet and that we are intimately connected via the world economy, the internet, travel, trade and so forth. Just as the U.S. has separate states that are a part of one country, we are also a country that is one of many that make up the countries of the world. We are part of one world, in other words, and we have to balance our national interests with our global interests. In short, a fascist I am not.

You were correct with regards to me being happy. I am, though there's always room for improvement in my personal life and in the collective lives of the people around the world. One thing that would make me happier would be if you would just let go of your opinion on this matter and realize that you are gravely mistaken. The planet if in the shape of a sphere; it orbits around the sun on an annual basis and mankind has triggered climate change. These facts are equally true. Fortunately, we have the capacity to come up with ways to mitigate the effects of climate change. Unfortunately, there are people such as yourself who have bought into a false bill of goods. Fortunately, as time goes on, fewer and fewer people are buying into that false bill of goods as they think matters through logically and rationally, and have come to the conclusion that they were initially mistaken.

That 97% crap has been around forever, and here's how it started:


The ""97% of scientists"" crap came from a two question, yes or no survey by a Stanford grad student which was sent out to over 10,000 earth scientists.

Of those, only 3,146 responded, with SEVERAL HUNDRED of the respondents saying no to the global warming religion. 

Not getting the answers that she wanted, this grad student then THREW OUT 98% of all the responses she got and only counted 77 of the responses.

It's like when the scientists at the IPCC are tasked with finding out about global warming, and they come to the conclusion that we can't really know about it with any certainty.

Calculating the energy that is needed for the atmosphere to warm up by one degree(C) is about 5,95X10exp21J/C and at comparison the world's oceans needs roughly 1000 times more energy to have the same amount of warming(all the water in oceans). Also measurements from GRACE satellites shows about 2,9X10exp15kg ice loss in Greenland between 02-12. This is equivalent about 0,16 degrees(C) if the same amount of heat(that is required to melt that ice) is added to the atmosphere. So, nobody really knows exactly where(how many percentage emitted by oceans etc.) is all the additional(human caused) heat going, but surely it is going somewhere and that will(have already) trigger(ed) dangerous chain of events. Just think about that how much already added CO2(about 40%, but not linear impact) will add the total heat in Earth knowing that CO2 is the second largest contributor to greenhouse effect after water vapor(total GHG-effect estimated to be 33C where H2O play roughly a bit more than half of the total and CO2 roughly 10-20%).  A very dangerous addiction/experiment. 

Science often doesn't ""give"" exact or even closely realistic estimates, or suppositions like for ex. Big Bang as an absolute starting point for everything is just one example of a naive assumption and thus asking why something exists, is an absurd question and so on. However, this doesn't mean that all the science is false, or even most of it, but more like there is human hubris and also pressure to have exact results from a myriad of different instances and this can bee seen clearly for ex. where infinity is in contrast to our limited minds i.e. humans, even very smart ones, have a weaknes of logical thinking when faced with something ""too complex"" to understand.

We will adapt to any climate fluctuation far better WITH fossil fuel driven innovation and society advances, far better than if we were crippled and overwhelmed WITHOUT fossil fuels to help us!

From the article

""....despite the fact that starting an analysis with this super-hot year tends to mute it""

Yes, and then ENDING the trend with super-hot years tends to amplify it. In both cases, it was an El Nino that was responsible for he warming, and had nothing to do with 'global warming'. I wonder why they would mention how 1998 was an El Nino year but they FAIL to mention that 2015 was also an El Nino year. I wonder why that is? Boy, that sure is a puzzler. (go ahead, I searched for Nino in the article. The only mention is the 98 El Nino, not the 2015 one)

Hey, and here's another thing I wonder: I wonder why a few months of warmer weather caused by El Nino is something that 'weakens the argument, but 18 years and 8 months of flat temps does NOT weaken the global warming argument, EVEN THOUGH they were all DEAD WRONG about it. Again, another puzzler. 

And now that I'm wondering, I gotta wonder why the article said this:

""Moreover, over the past 18 years that Cruz likes to cite — the period since 1998, a record warm El Nino year that officially remains the hottest year in the satellite record — there’s now also a trend, despite the fact that starting an analysis with this super-hot year tends to mute it""

Actually, they are quoting Cruz from January, and so the latest temp readings that gave us 18 years and 8 months of a pause only go to Sept 2015. This means that 18 years and 8 months was actually the beginning of 1997. 

Why is this important? Well, as you can see from their statement above, they are trying to get us to believe that the RSS data starts from the very hottest point in 1998. But if you look at the 18/8 graph, it actually starts in 1997. And the very first month that is graphed is not only not unusually hot, but's it's actually BELOW NORMAL. 

That's right, instead of cherry-picking an unusually high temp to start (as this article tries to claim), the start date for the 18/8 is actually a below normal temp anomaly. Again, I have to wonder why they did this. 

You see, you have to know how to read articles like this one and you have to know the facts (as I've just presented them), so you can sort through the obvious unscientific bias.",UCjgmx51WVX0-ahU0DuXiIIg,1.0,UgjZ62_VEqz-U3gCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

Science has always been a passion of mine and I know well what the scientific method is and how it is implemented.

No amount of people testing and using his formulas could prove him 100 percent right, because all that means is that you've never stumbled upon a case where the equations failed. When he says that one expirement could prove me wrong, what he means is that if one case was found where is equations failed, that represents the failure of his formula, brought on by just one expirement. In the climate case, we're not talking about new laws that explain the way things work, we're talking about getting different results when analyzing the effect of humans on climate change; we're using the same data ideally, but we're coming to different conclusions.

at a rate of several centimetres per day. Due to its close proximity to 
the Icefields Parkway, between the Alberta towns of Banff and Jasper, and rather easy accessibility, it is the most visited glacier in North America.[2]
 The leading edge of the glacier is within easy walking distance; 
however, travel onto the glacier is not recommended unless properly 
equipped. Hidden crevasses have led to the deaths of unprepared tourists.

Look back over the past 100 years and find a case where the scientific community was warning us about something which turned out to be wrong, and the result was massive harm to human health and safety. It just hasn't happened. Now look back at all the times industry lobbyists were telling us something is safe despite the warnings of scientists and you'll see millions of cases of cancer, birth defects, asthma, droughts and pollution.

If you wanna see the actual other side of the scientific argument, go look through the scientific research, there are a few papers that came with a different conclusion (they all agree that climate was changing, but a very few scientists said that it wasn't human made - their conclusions however were refutted once more data started to come in with new scientific papers -).

Volcanoes have an insignificant effect on the increase of greenhouse gases.

""Most of the particles spewed from volcanoes cool the planet by shading incoming solar radiation. ""
""Volcanoes also release large amounts of greenhouse gases such as water vapor and carbon dioxide. The amounts put into the atmosphere from a large eruption doesn't change the global amounts of these gases very much. ""
http://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/how-volcanoes-influence-climate

""The current level of volcanic activity is completely normal, on the contrary (if not on the low end of averages over decades). 
The main difference is that there is faster and more information available, as well as increased media coverage and public interest on the subject of global volcanic activity. This might give the impression that volcanic activity is on the increase (which it is not). ""

As for the quote re: the sun getting hotter which you took from SkepticalScience - you quoted the MYTH !!!

This is what they wrote in the next paragraph to debunk that myth ...
""The ACRIM composite shows a slight increase in TSI - the PMOD composite shows a slight decrease. Regardless of which dataset you use, the trend is so slight, solar variations can at most have contributed  only a fraction of the current global warming.""

810,UggF3OMrO9aVNHgCoAEC,0.0,0.0,2016-05-08T11:04:51Z,reference2me,"...Is the number of volcanic eruptions worldwide increasing?  Yes.  During the 20th century, there were a total of 3,542 volcanic eruptions globally.  That works out to approximately 35 eruptions per year.

That may sound like a lot, but according to Volcano Discovery there are 36 volcanoes erupting around the world right now.  In other words, the number of volcanoes erupting as you read this article is greater than the 20th century’s yearly average.  And all of this is part of a larger trend.  In 2013, we witnessed the most volcanic eruptions worldwide that we had ever seen in a single year, and 2015 is already threatening to be another one for the record books.  All over the planet, volcanoes that have long been dormant are beginning to wake up, and this is greatly puzzling many scientists.  Fortunately, most of the eruptions in recent years have been relatively small.  But scientists tell us that if we do see a VEI 7 or a VEI 8 eruption today, the amount of energy that would be released would be somewhere in the neighborhood of a million nuclear bombs going off all at once, and such an eruption would completely literally transform our civilization almost overnight.

There is no single continuous satellite measurement of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Instead, the data is composited from various satellite measurements. The two most cited composites are PMOD and ACRIM. According to Nicola Scafetta, ACRIM more faithfully reproduces the observations whereas PMOD assumes the published TSI satellite data are wrong and need additional corrections. In particular, PMOD alters the data from the Nimbus7/ERB record from 1989 to 1991. Nimbus7/ERB data during such a short period show a clear upward trend while PMOD during the same period is almost constant. The alteration of the Nimbus7/ERB data is responsible for the different shape between the ACRIM and PMOD TSI composites (Shining More Light on the Solar Factor).",UCczk7l3l64RNKEqHyHmmpJA,1.0,UggF3OMrO9aVNHgCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

By the way Anthropogenic means ""originating in human activity""

How many of these peer reviewed papers did you read to come to your conclusion that climate change is not happening?

You do realise that the USA is the only country where climate change is an opinion, not an accepted fact !! But of course you should believe your politicians and Fox News because it's freezing today !! Oh and the big oil companies donate money to get them re-elected so that they can stay in business !!

Here is a list of worldwide scientific organisations which support the view that climate change is real and is caused by human activity...
https://www.opr.ca.gov/s_listoforganizations.php

I went to the University of Melbourne in the early 1970's and climate change, global warming and the Greenhouse Effect were part of my Science Degree Course ... Scientists have known for a long time that our burning of fossil fuels was increasing global temperatures.
The burning of fossil fuels produces 21.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year.
This is an indisputable fact.

And the fact that Sarah Palin denies climate change is ignorant, especially when two towns on the coast of Alaska (Kivalina and Newtok) are going to be underwater within a few years.

Several people have done that and NASA has spoken on this very subject.  

quote  “And the fact that so-called rises of the sea levels have not materialised, and that any real scientist doesn't back up man-made climate change at all, since it's a cycle that has existed even before we did.”

However, Morales was left stunned when NASA shot him down by responding: ""Do not misrepresent Nasa. Fossil fuels are not cooling the planet.”

Liberals face the same pressures, because even though most people don't want their pet government programs interfered with, they also recoil against runaway government, debt, trade deals that seem to give away jobs instead of protecting them, environmental law activism that interferes with business expansion, etc.  The end result is most candidates, once in office, inexorably move to the middle.

Unlike other fields, math and science are subject to disproof. But also unlike other fields, they are not up for debate. Politicians, almost none of which have a background in math, science, or engineering, don't seem to understand this. Their approach is to win arguments, not prove or disprove something with repeatable, quantifiable evidence.

And when you finally look closely at the ""CHANGE"" it's well within the margins of error of the data. 

Finally, you have models the I remember starting in the 70's that all predict major changes in the climate in the future that never actually transpire. You can't get funding unless there is a reason ... and crisis is a reason. Hence why it's political.

Don't get me wrong ... we need to end the dependency on fossil fuels, but replacing them with inefficient and costly systems will ruin economies and cause more death then a slight rise in temperature ... which by the way would support more bio diversity. So ... yes it's all politics.

Either way, the Earth's temperature is not a function of who wins a debate or an election. This is why it is a scientific issue, not a political issue. If it wasn't a scientific issue, it wouldn't be studied by scientists. Scientists don't study things like civil rights or budget appropriations.

2+2 = 4 isn't a mathematical issue, it's a political issue! How do we know 2+2 = 4, anyway? I disagree! Yeah, sure, there's evidence, but not everyone agrees it's the truth; I certainly don't. The mathematicians don't know what they're talking about and they're jumping to conclusions. And even if 2+2 equals 4 now, how do we know if it's always equaled four? How do we know it always will? We don't!
It's a conspiracy that people are trying to get you to believe precisely because mathematicians get paid the same regardless of their findings. Also, never mind the thousands of mathematicians who agree, I found one that mentioned the number two in a different context, which can be interpreted as disagreement, and that carries more weight than all the rest of them combined. PROOF! HA!
Besides, before I was taught that 2+2 = 4, I believed that 2+2 = potato, and nothing will convince me otherwise. I also believe that evolution is a lie, the world is flat, and bloodletting cures all disease. In conclusion, we just don't know, so I'm not going to bother learning any new information.

Even worse is the fact that the ""consensus"" crowd is ignoring the really big elephant in the room: Ice Age! That's what we've been living in for the last 2.6 Million years, ever since both poles gained a permanent glacier. For NASA to be calling our current minor thaw a ""fever"" only shows how truly unscientific and political they've become. Gag!

Because we live in an Ice Age, we need to be concerned that the current interglacial doesn't end real soon. But, oops! According to W.S. Broecker, in his 1998 paper on interglacials, the Holocene is already 500-6,000 years overdue to end, based on average interglacial lengths.

The earth warms due to the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Levels of CO2 have skyrocketed since around the time of our industrial revolution. This isn't a coincidence, it's due to us burning very large amounts of fossil fuels.
The warming of the planet causes the ice at the polar ice caps to melt, adding more and more fresh water to the oceans, in turn changing the massive currents that help to stabilize the planets climate. This is a huge problem. Sea levels will rise flooding coastal areas and then the earth will cool, bringing even more climate problems, and a possible ice age.

Because of those 2 little white things at the poles. Surprise! We live in an Ice Age and the current interglacial (Holocene) is overdue to end. Oops! How about another 90,000 years of Frozen Climate. Making people fear warmth is like making them fear food. Dumb!

During the last 600 Million years (the time we've had life on land), the average temperature was something like +7C warmer than today. We even had one period of 14 million years where the temperature was +20C warmer and CO2 at 4000 ppmv (10x current levels) and no runaway greenhouse effect burning up the planet. Life thrived, as it always does in the warmth.

""It is a truism that almost any sect, cult, or religion
will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do
so.""-Robert A. Heinlein  P.T .
Barnum was right when he said there's a sucker born every minute. The climate
change suckers are the all time proof, buying in to an unknowable temperature
prediction 84 years from now when virtually no one living today will be around
to find out the truth. The earth is covered 70% by water; 1/2 is dark at any
time of a 24 hour period, and cloud cover some times blocks the sun on sunny
days, yet these climate suckers want to send billions of $$ a year of our
taxpayer money to 3rd world countries, not to improve their way of life but to
have them invest in wind and solar; no substitute for coal or gas power
generation, and anemic in their ability to be of much use to countries that
wish to become independently prosperous through industrial output.

The trouble is probably not in YOUR area.  It's where livestock exceed natural carrying capacities of ecosystems - globally - by 7's. There are simply too many farmed animals breathing, defecating, and belching for plants to suck up the amount of carbon they're producing.

Yes, I agree, stop it with the burning of fossil fuels, but given the dangerous timeline we're on; Even if we all stopped burning all fuels, we wouldn't see a change in the atmosphere for close to 100 years.  If we stopped it with the gluttonous chow down of beef and milk, we would see a change within a decade.

Observing the current climate, it's changes and place it to substantive time scale, observations/measurments about changes in atmospheric composition(for ex.

What do scientists have to gain from letting people know we are affecting the earth negatively? Corporations under threat from climate change laws have a lot to lose from these scientist's findings so it is in their interest to find a lot more than 3% of the science community's crop to forward their claim that nothing is happening. Considering how effective corporations are at getting their way in pretty much everything else why have they not managed to get more people on their side? The science community, incidentally, is not a group of bearded men who live in a commune somewhere in California - it's a disparate group of thousands from every country in the world who are coming to - if not the same, at least remarkably similar conclusions. Is this scepticism a fear of losing the right to drive a really big car or having to eat more healthy food? Because their is no logic in opposing this. The only thing that makes sense is that small minded individuals believe that laws to help fight climate change will affect their lives directly. But that is usually not the case - it is people who believe there is some bizarre liberal conspiracy to take over the world with expensive and incredibly profitable (for them) industries of frightening things like war-inducing energy sources like water, wind and the sun. But there is so little profit in going green. It is expensive to create in the short run so no politician dares to do it. In the long run it is very cheap and can save future generations from catastrophe. But that would mean an end to the status quo of countries with access to gas and oil running the world. It would entail a huge power shift. This is something corporations relying on the current energy sources will fight forever so they will come up with anything to stop this information - like Sarah Palin and a crop of 3% of scientists who are willing to be bought.

Apparently you don't understand how a scientific consensus is reached. It needs to be reached independently, with independent research, with different scientists all over the world. There has to be a VAST conspiracy among scientists in different fields, working for different organizations and with vastly different backgrounds, all conspiring together in order to have all reached the same conclusion. 

Meanwhile, the anti-climate change side has no scientific consensus, is paid for by the oil industry (this isn't even a claim, but a fact- easily researched).

If you're a scientist who denies climate change you can make FAR more money working for the oil industry than you can working for some underfunded scientific or government organization.

1. Jimmy Kimmel isn't a scientist. 

2. Ice cores are only one way of assessing temperatures and atmospheric changes. There are other ways. 

And the only people disputing the accuracy of ice cores are climate change deniers. It's like saying that evolution is disputed. It's not expect by people who are scientifically ignorant.

We've been able to gauge temperatures and atmospheric changes going back a LOT longer than the 1850s.

3. Yes, there are cycles, but when you see an anomaly, as we are seeing right now, then it's a sign of a problem.

This excuse doesn't carry any water and is easily debunked by even a little research on the subject.

Please do it.

4. There are sources that show that aliens built the pyramids, but they aren't legit. 

The reason you can't find it is because it's not legitimate. 

When the scientific consensus says one thing, and one or two sources say something else, the one or two sources are most likely wrong. And if they're not, they need to show pretty conclusive evidence they aren't. And those sources have not.

1. Is the climate still in fact warming or has it leveled off?
2. If so, is human-kind responsible?
3. If so, is there anything we can do about it?
4. If so, why did the Paris climate agreement have more restrictions for the U.S.A. than it did for China, which is even a bigger polluter?

It is not true that 15 of the last 16 years were the hottest ever!  Not even close!  That is just the latest myth for global warming.  Only 2015 broke the record.

All of the arguments for global warming is just theory.  Science can prove global warming can happen, but that doesn't mean it is actually happening.  Much of the propaganda, like this video, rely on blind faith in the majority of scientists.  What they are saying is, ""Don't ask for proof, just trust scientists!""  If you research global warming, you'll be inundated with theory; while that theory is sound, the primary argument is, if the theory is sound, it must be happening, and if most scientists believe it, so should you!  If you don't trust the scientific community, the whole global warming argument falls apart, because it lacks evidence to stand on.

That ""counter claim"" is pure bullshit. You have no evidence and it is a cop-out. Say God was steering evolution. Therefore, Evolution still exists. Creationists make many claims, and every one of them has been proven false, demonstrably. Look up  AronRa's ""The Foundational Falshehoods of Creationism"" series. There's a reason that the supreme court, years before Obama, have said that teaching creationism in schools is against the constitution: it's indoctrinating religion. I've even studied many aspects of evolution and genetics, and trust me, it is much more enlightening and fascinating than a magical sky-daddy.

And yes, you ARE making claims. You keep saying science is tainted by politics, when I have clearly explained to you why it is not and you just go ""uh-uh."" in denial. I have given you specific sites to look up, and you just tell me to ""google"" it for your claims. The internet is full of bullshit, and you need to be careful to find a reputable source for your claims. Science is independent of politics. Even if the first researchers made up their data and claims, other qualified individuals would have investigated those claims and found them to be fraudulent. 

It happened before with the anti-vax scam: one scientist lied about his data because he did not disclose his interest in another company. Other SCIENTISTS, not POLITICIANS, I may add, investigated his claims through their own independent research, and found them fraudulent. His research was retracted and he was barred from practicing medicine. If anything, science is a more reliable way of weeding out corruption, because bad science will always be corrected in the future. These scientists aren't ""united"" to give out a common dogma; they challenge each other all the time, and do their best to break any scientific theory out there. The reason both GW and evolution hold up is because they been tested repeatedly, and no credible individual has found a way to prove them false. I've explained this to you a hundred times over. You better have some very good articles to tell me otherwise.

The counter claim to those examples of evolution is that they were acts of God and only appear as evolution.

I am not claiming anything. You keep accusing me of making claims concerning specific acts of politics. I never claimed anything. I am talking of possibilities. You should look up the history of corruption in politics if you really want to understand what others have seen and why they don't entirely trust politics and things that get heavily connected to them as GW is. Just googling subtle political corruption will get you some results.

Also you said ""where funding climate denial comes from"" that would be falling into an indirect/subtle category.

Evolution has been proven again and again. We have fossils, we have seen differences between closely related species, we've even observed species change into entirely different ones! We understand genetics and how it effects mutation, and natural selection has held up remarkably well, and the theory is 200+ years older than GW. The evidence for evolution isn't just compelling, it's OVERWHELMING.

This is your problem.You claim these things are touched by dirty politics, but you don't actually investigate the claims on your own, nor do you try to verify what are more legitimate sources. You say you're presenting possibilities, but you have nothing to back them up. I could yell how we should live underground because there's a POSSIBILITY a meteor could hit us. But is it likely? Unless NASA confirms Armageddon was heading our way, you'd have every right to call me out on my bullshit, because I'm shouting it without showing you the evidence.

quick example - my hippy friend used to complain that i never recycled at the house. i didn't have the space and found it cumbersome, and i was just 1 house, right? every day huge events are held that generate massive amounts of trash that is not recycled. that bothered me. why was she preaching at me? I told her to go preach at the sports teams and the festivals that generate the real bulk trash. She said ""why don't you?"" and it made sense. About a year later I'm sitting across the table from the 'sustainability director' of a 20k seat arena in town on a volunteer mission to meet someone just like that and deliver her message. And I did. I politely called the woman out, asked how much trash they hit the landfill with every event, and she discussed with me her business issues (mainly the cost of hauling trash away). We took 5 minutes to hash out a workable solution and she thanked me and immediately started telling the other people at the table how she was going to take my advice and change policies. A couple months later I attended an event at that arena and sure enough there were various recycling containers, including the 4-headed sorter types, around and all the paper and plastic from the snackbar was clearly labeled recyclable.

that was me advocating for bigger change, and saving more trash from the landfill than my household could generate in 500 years. and i do recycle now anyway, stopped that hypocrisy.",UCpOe2cCC1eZ2v1GvWZTk3uA,1.0,UgjCEe7YXQeOIXgCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center is engaged in a 40 year study of Antarctica. It's currently performing airborne polar ice thickness reconnaissance in a DC8 planes, topographically mapping the thickness of the continental ice shelves in Antarctica. The radar equipped plane can actually see under the ice, allowing accurate tracking of any change in the ice mass of the polar shelf, it's the most sophisticated radar system, world-wide. The plane flies at 1500 feet with equipment that detect any change in the polar ice up to 5 cm in size. It is currently changing up to 7 meters per year and they have been flying these reconnaissance ice mapping missions since 1992 and with that data sample size, you can witness the change in the ice over the decades.

Antarctica holds 90 percent of the world's ice and 70% of the world's fresh water. If Antarctica melts at the rate it currently is melting, it will re-map the United States and every other country in the world, due to the 15 foot rise of the ocean's waters. When other countries can no longer support their population, the refugees coming to America will dwarf that of Syrian refugees. It will be the greatest upheaval of population the world has ever seen. And our fresh water preserves will be down to 30%, world-wide. 

Greenland was the first alarm, where the melt is 60 years ahead of scientists predictions. The melt rates are documented, they are real, and NASA has the data to prove it. 

If Antarctica is allowed to melt....well let's just say that we are the last generation who can do something about it. There will not be a second chance.

The whole scam is based on the idea that the planet is historically hot right now and a few degrees of warming will push us over the edge. Nothing could be farther from the truth. We're historically cold right now, not hot. Atmospheric CO2 content is very low right now, not high. If atmospheric CO2 content fell to 150 ppm, all life on Earth dies. Meanwhile, life exploded onto Earth when atm. CO2 levels were much higher. The Mesozoic Period which gave us dinosaurs, flying reptiles and birds had an atm.

The difference is that many leftists accept anthropogenic climate change because that's the fashionable thing to do on the left right now, whereas I have accepted anthropogenic climate change only after expending considerable effort investigating and understanding the subject.

Unfortunately, rejecting anthropogenic climate change (and thereby rejecting vast bodies of scientific evidence) is fashionable on the right at the present time. That will change, though, because reality always catches up with perception in the end.

This is not a liberal/conservative issue, of course. It is a matter of facts, i.e., of evidence and observation.

At present, the evidence indicates that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 over pre-industrial levels will produce a direct warming result of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C _(Lourius 1990, Hoffert 1992, Hansen 1993, Gregory 2002, Chylek 2007, Tung 2007, Shwartz 2007 & 2008, Bender 2010)_.

Climate sensitivity cannot be pinpointed to exact figures owing to the enormous complexity of the systems involved. However, multiple vectors of empirical research have narrowed the figures to within a high-confidence range of 1.5-4.5 degrees C.

During the Pliocene, three million years ago, temperatures were 3 degrees higher than today's pre-industrial levels. The northern hemisphere was free of glaciers and ice sheets, beech trees grew in the Transantarctic mountains, sea levels were 25 metres higher, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were 360-400 ppm. _[Climate Dynamics 26, 249-365, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103, 39, 14288-93]_.

A group of 4000 volunteers was assigned the task of evaluating the abstracts of 12,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers about climate change. Papers which expressed a position on anthropogenic climate change were categorized as endorsing the phenomenon, not endorsing the phenomenon, or taking no position. Each paper was evaluated twice. The identities of co-evaluators were not known to each other. In cases of disagreement, papers were evaluated by a third volunteer. The volunteers were an internationally diverse group from Australia, USA, Canada, UK, New Zealand, Germany, Finland, and Italy. The received zero funding and operated on a purely volunteer basis.

To correlate their findings, 8,500 authors of the evaluated papers were contacted to articulate whether their publication endorsed, did not endorse, or took no position on anthropogenic climate change. 1,200 authors responded, confirming the position taken by 2,400 papers.

Of the 12,000 papers evaluated, 4,000 took an explicit position on anthropogenic climate change, and 97.1% of these endorsed the phenomenon. Of the 2,400 papers authored by scientists responding to the study, 1,400 took an explicit position on anthropogenic climate change, and 97.2% of these endorsed the phenomenon. These findings were consistent with the _Doran, Zimmerman (2009)_ study which found a 97.4% consensus, and the _Anderegg et al.

The term ""climate change denier"" is apt because it also describes a group of people who deny something that is plainly true.

The suffix ""denier"" is used in the pejorative because people who deny things which are plainly true necessarily invite ridicule. Individuals who insist that Elvis Presley is still alive are ridiculed, because that belief denies a something that's plainly true, i.e., that Elvis Presley is deceased. Denying the holocaust is like this. Denying anthropogenic climate change is like this. It is denying something that is plainly true.

Climate change deniers are not referred to as ""skeptics"" by anybody other than themselves because they are plainly out of touch with reality. Skeptical people are not necessarily out of touch with reality, but climate deniers definitely are.

Individuals who accept the reality of climate change but are skeptical about its ramifications do not belong under this heading, and are thereby not the people I described.

Regardless, the climactic ramifications of doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide are as clear and unmistakable as the health ramifications of running a car in a closed garage.

Climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide can be measured empirically by comparing past temperature changes to natural forcings occurring at that time. At present, the evidence indicates that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 over pre-industrial levels will produce a direct warming result of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C _(Lourius 1990, Hoffert 1992, Hansen 1993, Gregory 2002, Chylek 2007, Tung 2007, Shwartz 2007 & 2008, Bender 2010)_. This direct warming excludes feedback mechanisms which amplify the planet's heat retentive capacity. During the last ice age, average surface temperatures were 3-4 degrees C cooler than they are today.

We know the sensitivity of the planet's climate systems is within the 1.5-4.5 degrees C range, and we know that doubling atmospheric CO2 will cause a 1.5-4.5 degree increase in average surface temperature. Because we know these things, we know that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are dangerous to the stability of climate systems. If you disagree with this, it means you disagree with the evidence, i.e., what is known. If you disagree with what is known, it means you are plainly incorrect.",UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA,1.0,UgjDV4WloJAjxngCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

If a climate denier does not have such a stake, their confusion is most likely attributable to the disinformation campaign funded by those who do. Essentially climate deniers are either liars, or people who have been persuaded by liars.

Some people are deeply insecure and feel the need to aggrandize themselves by imagining that they have special access to privileged information kept secret by monolithic, hidden powers. Such individuals are easily persuaded by the notion that anthropogenic climate change is a concept invented to deceive the entire world into accepting a global communist dictatorship with carbon regulation as its instrument of social control. They cling to this notion despite a complete lack of good evidence, and despite the overwhelming abundance of evidence to the contrary, entirely because it tranquillizes their feelings of inadequacy and insignificance.

This probably covers all climate-denying demographics. They all have one thing in common: an obstruction in their critical thinking ability.

They would tell you they believe there is no climate change because weather has always been weird, they had cold summers in the 1970&#180;s and hot winters in the 1960&#180;s.....And this is true, weather has always been weird. If you ask them what do they think about the stats that websites put up showing that the climate has changed the past 25 years faster than normal, they would respond by saying whoever puts up stats has a motive behind those stats, and stats are adjusted to make you believe in what that website or person is saying. And this is also true, even people who have facts in front of them always exxagerate the facts to convince you. These are the answers you will get. In truth, though, their real answer which they would never say is I have no idea but the politicians I support say the truth, so I believe them. 
Truth and fact is this; is the climate changing? Yes. Does anyone really care? No. Because we will all be dead, our great great great great great grandchildren will probably all be dead before the climate actually hurts the human race. And humans do not even care about the current humans on our planet, why would they care about the humans who will be here in 500 or 1000 years? 
Chances are when the climate gets that bad science will be so far ahead that any harm done to humans can be avoided.  I don&#180;t know this, I am only assuming. Scientist won&#180;t say this because they have a motive to telling you scary things so that you change your ways and think like they do. People on the right side of this arguement and wrong side of this arguement have one goal; humans should believe them and do what they say. So politicians and scientist alike will eitehr tell you 0% chance of anything bad happening or 100% chance of something bad happening. None will tell you the actual truth because no one actually knows what will happen, when it will happen, or if science will be so advanced that it can all be avoided at the time it happens. .",UCrYWTmoLwqSk1kiGpOIGxNQ,1.0,UgjDV4WloJAjxngCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

In politics when this happens the party that wasn't leading the charge goes the Devil's advocate route, but unfortunately the GOP is not doing this because they wish to provoke debate or test the strength of the argument. They rally against climate change because they were way too late to the discusion and can't take or share credit for addressing this dire problem. If you don't believe this just look at the 9/11 Zadroga Act, which many of you might be familiar with thanks to John Stewart and The Daily Show. The only reason Republicans on Capital Hill did not support the act was because Democrats were the face of it. This is 100% fact. Republicans in Congress refused to vote for it unless they could find a way to pass it and take equal if not more credit. They decided not to vote for it because there was no way to change it to the point that Republicans could share credit. Changes could only hurt the act and Republicans knew this so they made the decision to it die rather than see Democrats be heroes to 9/11 victims. Republicans had to be publicly shamed to such a degree that they begrudgingly passed it and the same thing happened recently to get it extended. NO MATTER WHAT ANY TALKING HEAD TELLS YOU IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH A POORLY DRAFTED ACT THAT NEEDED FIXING AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT REPUBLICANS COULD NOT TAKE ANY CREDIT FOR IT BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER INTERESTED IN IT JUST LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE.

But here is where it gets interesting. Methane (the greenhouse gas that livestock produces) is about 100x more effective at trapping heat from the sun as CO2.

 of temperature changes throughout our planet's history, this does not 
mean that causes are unknown, unknowable, or all the same. The 
application of the scientific method is great for working out cause/effect relationships. Scientists have managed to link several warming and cooling cycles in the geologic
 history to specific causes. They have also shown that the modern 
warming is due to the added output of humans burning fossil fuels and 
destroying carbon sinks.  Past natural climatic patterns that were 
destructive were associated with cool periods while the projected future
 catastrophe from AGW is going to be associated with warming; this makes
 man-made climate change much worse than naturally occurring climate 
change.
The existence of previous warming cycles does not negate 
the seriousness of the current one. These previous cycles destroyed a 
great deal of life on the planet, and if similar effects occurred today 
they would probably destroy all of human civilization, along with the 
humanity that created it. This does mean that the earth itself will

Scientists questioning the accuracy of IPCC climate projections
These scientists have said that it is not possible to project global climate accurately enough to justify the ranges projected for temperature and sea-level rise over the next century. They may not conclude specifically that the current IPCC projections are either too high or too low, but that the projections are likely to be inaccurate due to inadequacies of current global climate modeling.

Let's take a look at every one of those links and how ridiculous they are.

Your first and second link only supports my earlier claim, and the usage of the term climate change. Winters are getting colder, summers are getting hotter, and the overall average temperature is increasing. If you look back at my first comment, I made literally that exact argument.

Your third link is about a British aristocrat, with no history of or obvious engagement with science, who claims that his own satellite data shows a lack of climate changes. You claim that I am denying raw data, despite the fact that this article provides almost no data whatsoever. Additionally, the idea that an aristocrat should be trusted more when it comes to environmental patterns than a scientist whose sole purpose is to analyze trends in climate is ludicrous and laughable.

Your fourth link says that literally a single adviser to the PM of one of the most polluting countries in the world thinks climate change is a hoax. You likely didn't read until the end of the article, in which a professor in Melbourne states this Adviser is purposefully misleading the public, and compares him to a flat earth believer. Once again, I'm going to take a professor whose job is to analyze climate's words over that of an adviser (who also provides no raw data, which seems to be a theme among the deniers you cite).

The final link you provide indicates that the co-founder of The Weather Channel doesn't believe in climate change. While he is the only person you've mentioned that has any semblance of credibility in relation to discussing climate issues, its worth pointing out that he is just an old meteorologist, who created a TV Channel. I'd much prefer the words of a majority of scientists than an old man who probably spent more time running a TV channel than studying the weather. Also worth mentioning, he doesn't provide a single instance of raw data. Interesting.

For someone who accuses me and all the other ""cultists"" of not looking at raw data, its certainly interesting that the only raw data you provide me with actually SUPPORTS climate change. 

I also noticed you've dropped every single one of your previous arguments in favor of just sending me links to read, and haven't raised a single thought or point of your own aside from regurgitated ad-hominems. How shocking that a climate change denier is unable to provide a legitimate argument, so they instead turn to mud-slinging and mindless restatements of illogical and untrustworthy sources. 

I find it amazing that I'm the one sucking up propaganda, when one of the articles you provide literally believes that the UN is trying to create a new world order of climate alarmism in order to suppress freedom and liberty. Sounds like a load of ridiculous propaganda to me and all other rational human beings.

You have the support of an aristocrat, a political adviser, and a meteorologist turned TV channel businessman. I think the odds are in my corner.",UCVag8MglH9uvMQ16j2H-bVA,1.0,UghT-feUZFLMYngCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

Rather than responding to anything I said, you cherry-pick something tangentially related at best, which proved to be incorrect. The lack of an increase in hurricane frequency doesn't disprove anything I said about rising temperatures, sea levels, ocean acidification, etc. 

All you have accomplished is disproving a singular statement made by Al Gore. Congratulations.

Additionally, after about two seconds of research, I found this: 

""We should not be worried about the frequency of hurricanes; we should be worried about the frequency of intense hurricanes,"" said Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""Climate change is causing a greater number of intense storms. The total number of storms has remained constant, but the proportion of high-intensity events has gone steadily upward in most parts of the world. Scientific models and real-world observations both suggest that the frequency of intense storms is going up."" (http://www.livescience.com/28489-sandy-after-six-months.html#sthash.zALPkUUZ.dpuf)

While climate scientists agree hurricanes haven't increased in frequency, they have certainly increased in strength. So while the original correlation that Al Gore pointed out is incorrect, there is still a pattern of climate change and hurricane intensity.

If you honestly think that the lack of an increase in the number of hurricanes since Katrina disproves the litany of examples I provided about the pervasiveness of climate change, you are delusional.",UCVag8MglH9uvMQ16j2H-bVA,1.0,UghT-feUZFLMYngCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

After hurricane Katrina, ALGORE, guaranteed more violent hurricanes to come.  In fact, the decade after was the weakest in a century.  You don't even have the most basic facts correct--plain and simple!

""Furthermore, research by Roger Pielke, Jr. of the University of Colorado found that weather events are becoming anything but extreme. Pielke told Congress that “on climate time scales in the US or globally, there has not been an increase in hurricanes, droughts, floods or tornadoes. The evidence for this claim is strong and is well-supported in the peer-reviewed literature, data collected by the U.S. government’s research agencies and the recent report on extreme events by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Pielke added that “the US has not seen an increase in hurricane landfall frequency or intensity since at least 1900, nor in measures of damage, normalized for societal change. In fact, the US is presently in the longest stretch without a Category 3+ hurricane landfall since at least 1900.”

The reason the term has changed to ""Climate Change"" is because, as science has discovered more and more information about it, we've learned that the greenhouse effect causes more extreme weather patterns in both cooling and heating. 

That, however, does not change the fact that the world is undeniably warming. Sea levels rise rates have doubled in the last decade. The 10 warmest years in human history have occurred within the last 12 years, despite the fact that solar output decreased during the 2000's, and hit a record low in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Ocean acidification rates have increased by THIRTY percent, and the ocean absorbs 2 BILLION TONS of carbon dioxide a year. Evidence to the contrary is scarce, heavily biased and skewed, and likely has some level of funding from big oil.

I also don't believe pollution is the main problem. I believe the fact that there are more humans releasing nitrogen into the world and that may be why heat is being contained.
I don't have too much evidence for this, except for some simple facts.

78% of the atmosphere is nitrogen, and .03% is co2.
Nitrogen is a bigger molecule than co2, and it would be more likely to prevent heat.
There is over 7.5 billion people on this world, and that means that we are releasing more nitrogen into the nitrogen carbon cycle, and more is being pumped out.

If you're really thinking that climate change is the biggest problem you're wrong. The fact is, there are too many humans on this world.

Using a video of cursing scientists warning of a tired litany of doom, using terms like ‘apocalyptic’; ‘catastrophic’; and ‘extremely dire’ was bland and predictable and the very reason that ‘Climate Hustle’ was made. Apparently, Kimmel thinks failure to believe in man-made global warming fears is akin to not believing in gravity or yogurt. Odd.”

“Mr. Kimmel, I challenge you to watch ‘Climate Hustle’ and issue an apology for your climate pablum that you spewed to viewers. ‘Climate Hustle’ was made to counter the very boilerplate rants that you, Mr. Kimmel, engaged in. The public needs to view ‘Climate Hustle’ if, for no other reason, than to hear Mr. Kimmel’s climate talking points dismantled. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming.”

They present plausible relationships between variables, but they're not always conclusive, and sometimes can be explained with alternative theories.

I'll just say that in practice science is _way_ fuzzier than what we expect of it in theory. It's because we think that as long as we have the data, we'll just use logic to make the right conclusion. But there is so much data out there that just ""applying logic"" really isn't that easy. In any statistical analysis, there are tons of factors regarding what sample you pick, how much testing you do, what variables to include and which ones not to, and you can have lots of disagreement on what method is actually a fair representation of the data.

I have taken some classes on income taxes so I could use that as another example. Theoretically, the government has all the laws laid out for us, and we just have to apply the rules to fill out the tax form correctly. Yet every tax expert will come up with a different number from the last. There are so many tax laws that it's literally impossible to remember all of them and their nuances. There are going to be certain human limitations in ""applying the logic"" of the law. So yeah, tax experts actually will develop some _subjective_ feelings from a presumably _objective_ set of rules because of the practical trouble in applying so many rules precisely.

The point is that the real world has too many variables to represent it all in precise, objective terms. We try to, by making guidelines, and putting things into simplified graphs and charts. I'm not saying that isn't highly useful, but there are always going to be inherent limitations to that and we need the humility to at least admit that.",UChcMQfREE5CPJjHYKRXDyfw,1.0,Ugjftn3tXbgCM3gCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

Is there a bigger cycle at play?

Life is different - a smart intellectual that dissects everything and is very analytical isn't going to have more influence in the societal structure than an arrogant, not completely dumb, but not really that smart self-absorbed politician. 

That's how it was and how it's always going to be. And even though it might be disheartening, it makes sense. 

The smart analyst is very slow to make a decision and he can't lead a nation, or a company. You can't run a country, a company and whatever else without simply having authority and the ego to tell other people what to do and be able to make decisions even with limited data on a daily basis. Otherwise nothing would ever move forward. 

So we need both the arrogant narcissists to lead and actually not be afraid to put their foot down and enforce something, but we also need the smart analysts who figure out complicated issues.

The problem is that the arrogant narcissists are very slow to actually listen to the analysts unless it serves their own benefit, because it's in their nature to lead and therefore inevitably ignore the opinions of others and have a huge ego. They are able to listen to someone occasionally, but you can't have them be wise, fairy-tale grandpas  like Gandalf or something. And if the narcissist in charge actually is not at all smart, but rather dumb like Palin, or Trump, or Bush, you have A LOT of work ahead of you if you want to get something important done.",UCjILDq_qDPW2QYbwJ1xujOg,1.0,UghEsty5UDQFh3gCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

Everyone seems to only look at the costs of warming and never its benefits. This does not seem sensible or rational. If we need to decide what amount of money is sensible to spend to try to forestall warming, we need to know what the net cost or benefit of warming would be, first, as well as the cost to stop it.

Of all agricultural land in the U.S., nearly 80 percent is used to raise animals for food. More than 260 million acres of U.S. forest have been cleared to create cropland to grow grain for animal feed, and about 85 percent of the seven billion tons of topsoil lost in the U.S. each year has been directly attributed to the enslavement of cows. It takes twenty times more land to sate the appetites of meat, dairy and egg-eaters than vegans: those who eat animal products require roughly 3.25 acres of land per person per year to feed themselves, whereas vegans require only 1/6 of an acre per person per year. One acre of land can yield 30,000 pounds of carrots, 40,000 pounds of potatoes or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes.

The idea that if we give the government more of our money they'll be able to solve climate change is absurd and dangerous.

The monetary influence works both ways and is not just a problem for the skeptics and the fossil fuel industry.  The renewable energy industry has just as much to benefit from the other side, as do politicians, environmentalists and the media.

THE EMBARRASSING BOMB-TEST-CURVE
""Why all the fuss about carbon? It only stays in the atmosphere for 10 years.

During the 1950s and 1960s, several nations performed atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. The radiation effects of these tests produced large amounts of C14-carbon dioxide (14CO2) in the air. 14C is an isotope of carbon, the common isotope being 12C. When the bomb tests ceased in 1963, the atmospheric level of 14CO2 had been raised to about twice its previous natural value. This extra 14CO2 can be used as a tracer for tracking the movement of carbon through the natural world – the Carbon Cycle. This wonderfully serendipitous experiment would be hard to beat even if someone designed it.

Over the following half-century the amount of 14CO2 measured in the global atmosphere diminished in a text-book exponential manner as shown in the diagrams above.

14C is radioactive but this curve is not the radioactive decay curve. The half-life of radioactive 14C is 5,730 years , whereas the half-time of the bomb-test curve is only 10 years, i.e. after 10 years only half was left, after 20 years, one quarter was left, after 30 years, only one eighth and so on.

The half-time of CO2 in the atmosphere is of great interest to climate modellers. They assume that CO2 is removed from the atmosphere according to a theoretical curve called the “Bern Model” or a similar curve called the ISAM model. The blue line in the lower panel shows predicted atmospheric decay curve of 14CO2 according to the Bern Model. It is quite different to the observed curve.

The Bern Model utilises four different half-times and does not return to nearly zero after 60 years as does the bomb-test curve. According to the Bern Model it will take centuries for 14CO2 (and anthropogenic CO2) to be ultimately removed from the atmosphere. The modellers chose to adopt the more alarmist scenario despite the fact that it is “non-physical” (i.e. obviously wrong).

Admittedly it is complicated: CO2 reacts with water chemically and this slows down the rate at which it dissolves. Furthermore, while there is a fast interchange of gases between the atmosphere and the top 100 metres or so of the ocean called the “mixed layer” (~70 Gt per year), it is widely assumed that there is much less transport through the bottom of the mixed layer (~2 Gt per year, IPCC figures). The latter is the reason for the flattening out of the Bern Model curve at times longer than 60 years.

But despite these quibbles about the half-time and the shape of the curve, one incontrovertible fact remains:

In 50 years nearly all the bomb-test 14CO2 has disappeared!

Since the 14CO2 reaction rates, solubilities and diffusion times are very similar to those 12CO2, this implies that all the ordinary atmospheric CO2 in the atmosphere at the time of the bomb test has completely changed over.

Where has all the 14CO2 gone?

There are various possible CO2 reservoirs, e.g. the biosphere and the mixed layer, but the problem is that these are roughly same size as the atmosphere. A new equilibrium would be soon be reached wherein the bomb 14CO2 would be partitioned between the reservoirs in proportion to their capacity, so causing the bomb 14CO2 in the atmosphere to level off in a similar way to the Bern model curve.

Instead it tends to zero. That this happens implies that the bomb 14CO2 has either been transported to a reservoir that is much, much larger than the atmosphere or it has left the ocean-atmosphere system.

It is commonly accepted that approximately 38,000 Gt of CO2 are dissolved in the deep ocean, more than 100 times the amount generated by humans since the start of the industrial revolution. The deep ocean is larger than any other conceivable reservoir. Either the missing 14C is sequestered in the deep ocean or it has been removed altogether, perhaps as carbonate in the skeletal material of sea creatures.

WOCE – the World Ocean Circulation Experiment produced detailed maps of the major constituents of the oceans in the mid-1990s. The WOCE Atlas is on-line and it is certainly worth a look; oceanography at its very best. The Pacific Ocean maps and sections are the most detailed and complete.

One of the chemical signatures mapped by WOCE is delta 14C, the proportion of 14C above the background level. Here is a map of delta 14C in the Pacific Ocean at a depth of 200 metres: ..""

But yeah, I don't see how you could assume that something is non-biased when it involves humans. If scientists have a certain feeling about something, and they have the power to make a consensus to present findings consistent with such a feeling, then theoretically it can be done. You don't think scientists have feelings about things and are tempted to use them? The fact that science doesn't allow for that is just a statement about how scientists are supposed to be, and it doesn't mean much if that statement can't be enforced.

Well it depends on what you think of the system that made such a consensus, and how that could affect a scientific issue where lots of indirect inferences are made. If you don't know about what that system entails, what the peer review is like, how it operates, then you might just be not-arrogant, rather than having life problems that should lead to your suicide. Or maybe, just maybe, somewhere in between.

If a person is to decide whether something is up for debate, it should be done because of his or her judgment based on info, not based on hearing just one side's opinion. Surely you would agree. If I was going to convict a murderer, I'd still want to hear the defense, even if it's a ridiculous story, because then my opinion would come from one that didn't infringe the freedom of others, rather than one where I already had my mind made up in the first place.",UChcMQfREE5CPJjHYKRXDyfw,1.0,UghXQFimYK9-WHgCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

 Now here is a science lesson for you, yes, real science without a political party or religion, just the facts unlike what you get from FAUX SNUZZ. 
CO1 is carbon monoxide and it is deadly to breath, causes cancer and other major lung disorders. When plants absorb it they produce 2 times the pollen and half as much O2 (oxygen) it would normally when it absorbs CO2 AKA carbon dioxide that most plants love, the plants absorb it, grow and produce O2 for the rest of us to breath. Oil and coal (fossil fuels) are the 2 most damaging fuels because they produce the most CO1 when burned, and possibly 100's of toxic chemicals from further processing of them, thus major damage to our environment in-turn to our health and welfare. They are followed up by nuclear fuels and weapons made from the waste (DU) cause cancers to all who come in contact with the residue from expended DU ammunition after it impacts and disintegrates AKA it turns to a fine dust less than 100 microns in size after impact with anything and is sent off in to the environment, dust so fine it passes through the filters on 99% of all gas masks issued to the military.
Man has been burning coal for more than 3000 years in China, and oil about 347AD in China again, (yes we can blame it all on China) on a smaller scale initially due to lack of access to it and mans lack of basic knowledge about it.

You don't need all of that, though. Greenhouse gases make up 5% of our atmosphere but are responsible for insulating the earth 100%. It wouldn't take much CO2 and methane to insulate the planet more; trapping more energy from the sun. 

Also, We don't have to produce all of the CO2 needed to cause a catastrophe on a global scale. All we have to do is heat up the planet enough to start melting the permafrost in the northern hemisphere. Billions of tons of carbon are trapped in the permafrost. Releasing even a tenth of that would start a chain reaction that could warm the planet by 10 degrees F.

""How well does the film handle the science? Admirably, I thought. It is remarkably up to date, with reference to some of the very latest research. Discussion of recent changes in Antarctica and Greenland are expertly laid out. He also does a very good job in talking about the relationship between sea surface temperature and hurricane intensity. As one might expect, he uses the Katrina disaster to underscore the point that climate change may have serious impacts on society, but he doesn’t highlight the connection any more than is appropriate.""

""For the most part, I think Gore gets the science right, just as he did in Earth in the Balance. The small errors don’t detract from Gore’s main point, which is that we in the United States have the technological and institutional ability to have a significant impact on the future trajectory of climate change. This is not entirely a scientific issue — indeed, Gore repeatedly makes the point that it is a moral issue — but Gore draws heavily on Pacala and Socolow’s recent work to show that the technology is there (see Science 305, p. 968 Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies).

I’ll admit that I have been a bit of a skeptic about our ability to take any substantive action, especially here in the U.S. Gore’s aim is to change that viewpoint, and the colleagues I saw the movie with all seem to agree that he is successful.""

For example, you argue against the existence of AGW on the basis that it implies certain policies in response. This is like denying your house is on fire based on the fact that you don't want your furniture to get wet. Water isn't the only way to put out a fire, and the climate policies you fear are not the only policy options that are up for consideration. We could avert near-term climate catastrophe by hundreds of different means, and we're already seeing changes in innumerable ways. Are you opposed to new technology? Do you realize that fossil fuels are a finite resource? Let's take your comment about brown people as an example --- you're basically saying that the only way for nations to develop is by implementing massive fossil-fuel based energy infrastructure that will become obsolete this century! If you're actually concerned for the development of Africa and southern Asia, then the best thing you can support is their development of sustainable energy systems. Think it through --- fossil fuels got us to a really good place, now it's time to move on to newer and better things. Solar and wind have dropped in price ten-fold since 1990 and they keep going down, and the more we switch over to those energy sources, the cheaper they get!

The real solution is decriminalizing drugs - their main income source. The way things are now literally just makes the drug problem terrible.

Addicts are treated like criminals, their lives are likewise destroyed by the stigma of using, and then they have nothing left but the drugs, in a cruel twist of fate.

And, since the sentencing for drugs is so terrible, it's high risk, so you literally get a bunch of psychopaths running the drug scene, building gangs, etc.

Psychopaths feel little to no remorse, and they are very likely to take risks and not think about the consequences. That's just their neural wiring. It's a lot different from yours or mine. They end up being socially engaging and manipulative as well, so they end up being the ones actually producing and operating these gangs.

These people will always exist - their social fearlessness also makes their reproductive success high.

So, that's the system that you face. You can respond angrily - or you can do what works and systematically decriminalize drugs so that the economics of actually dealing doesn't actually make the drugs expensive.

They should still be illegal, but the ""penalty"" should be rehab.

I take it you are about to go around Florida buying property or selling insurance to those who already own it.

After you are done with that please ask people in India where a heatwave killed thousands last year and another has already killed hundreds if the potential positives outweigh the already (and potential) negative impacts.

Now if you actually bothered to read the post it didn't omit scientists using the satellite record, what it did was interview both those who are deniers and those who gave reasons the satellite record is less reliable, still valuable but less reliable.


Speaking of if the media is omitting things a panel of scientists was asked to rate 12 candidates for President on ""scientific accuracy"".  The person who came in lowest (6 out of 100) was Ted Cruz, one of the spreaders of this satellites say it isn't happening distortion.

Now I understand the value of peer view.  I'm also pretty sure the surface temp records have been peer-reviewed and directly contradicts the claim ""For the  past 20-26 years, there has been no global warming.""

Now you dismissed the hottest February on the satellite record out of hand earlier.  While I pointed out the 1998 was an El Nino year (addressing your claim that was the hottest year).  It is evidence that supports a point one of the scientists mentioned in the article made-that it is quite possible 2016 will pass 1998 as the warmest year in the satellite record.

Back to the point about less warming than expected.  That doesn't mean no warming.

This is the importance of peer review, is that peer review has strong filters for nonsense.  This is why we use peer review over media sources, because it produces more reliable results.

There were years in the 90s without El Nino, but not enough years.  A couple years in the 90s before 1998 does not paint a statistical picture.

I have confirmed nothing.  For the  past 20-26 years, there has been no global warming.  This is a fact according to two measurements of the lower troposphere (UAH & RSS), which both agree remarkably well.  This is established in the peer review as well (will link to paper if interested).

All I said is that, even if you want to extend this beyond 20 years, the fact remains that the deceleration of global warming DESPITE the acceleration of greenhouse emissions is problematic for models.

1.  If you read the Washington Post article they interviewed actual scientists who I strongly suspect do publish in peer reviewed journals.

Plus, last I heard neither Ted Cruz nor the rightwing propagandist that runs climatedepot are scientists nor are their publications per reviewed.

2.  One of the actual scientists mentioned in the article said the surface tempurature record is more accurate. Carl Mears a ""physicist"" and Benjamin Santer a ""climate scientist"" both stated surface data is more accurate.  Your comment tells me you said I didn't provide evidence without even bothering to read the article I pointed to.

And in my earlier comment I very much did point out that the article interviewed actual scientists (who have looked into the topic you brought up).

3.  No.  Simply no. There are years in the 1990s with no El Ninos, and they are generally warmer than years with no El Ninos in the 1980s.

On top of that, even without being a climate scientist I'm pretty sure the general understanding of an El Nino is that one occurs for a couple years and spiking the temp for those years rather than a decade so it is not ""thought to have been responsible for the accelerated warming of the late 80s through 1998"".

And even if I were to take your notion that El Ninos warm a whole decade rather than a couple of years that doesn't contradict either the point global warming is occurring (which some have claimed even if you aren't right now) or that it is man made.  At best it simply says global warming is happening but at a slower rate.  So I guess thanks for confirming Global Warming is real (and thus a problem).",UCHxQYXAjlbsadIqQvm6_axg,1.0,UggtpeUQa6HJKngCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

#2 -- You state that surface temperatures are more accurate, but you give not a shred of data.  Satellites measure the lower troposphere temperature (first 10 miles).  This is where the Greenhouse Effect has its strongest impact, as GH gases settle down to lower levels of the atmosphere since CO2 and  H2O (water vapor) are heavier than air.  This is why the lower troposphere as a whole is more important.  

The temperature at the first few meters of the atmosphere isn't neraly as meaningful as longwave radiation from the lower troposphere as a whole.

#3 -- The claim is that there has been no global warming for 20-26 or more years.  This is of statistical significance because, at minimum, even if you were to take it back more than 20 years, there has been a deceleration in the amount of warming despite a rapid acceleration in human greenhouse emissions.

That's not even removing the El Nino signal, which is now thought to have been responsible for the accelerated warming of the late 80s through 1998.

Also, pointing to a single month and saying ""warmest on record"" is a meaningless statement.  

Also, I'm not sure where you get any data on neutral El Nino conditions considering there aren't many neutral years, especially when we're talking about the 1990s which were almost exclusively El Nino.

I looked into it and you seem to be spreading the same distortion on Global Warming that Cruz and Climatedepot-a website run by a guy who was never a scientist but has experience as door to door sales person (learned how to talk to people) and working for a denier Senator.

The 1/29/16 Washington Post article ""Ted Cruz keeps saying that satellites don't show global warming.  Here's the problem"" did a great job asking actual scientists about this particular distortion.  When asked, the actual scientists pointed out that.

1.  The particular satellites Cruz and other rightwingers like to mention measure the troposphere rather than the surface temperature when the surface temperature record is longer and more likely to be accurate (don't get me wrong the satellite record has value and I'll get to that).  The surface temp record shows 2015 was the hottest year.

2.  (getting to that)  The satellites the deniers refer to have a record going back to 1979 that, if looked at as a whole show Global Warming has been going on.  Many denier propagandists start around 1998 because that was an unusually strong El-Nino year rather than a typical year (no El-Nino or La-Nina).

3.  It is quite possible this selective evidence based distortion is will be undermined by the record from these specific satellites during 2016 (once this year is complete).  That is because an El-Nino has a delayed impact on the areas of the troposphere these satellites measure and the impact from the most recent El-Nino will be coming due this year.

My own take from this article and the satellite record deniers refer to plus other stuff is that.:

A.  The typical (non El-Nino or La-Nina) year is warmer in the 2000s than in the 1990s which are warmer than the 1980s and this shows a trend of global warming.

B.  Backing up point 3, the record from these satellites show that this past February in 2016 is the warmest in the satellite record.",UCHxQYXAjlbsadIqQvm6_axg,1.0,UggtpeUQa6HJKngCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

Because none of those actually add CO2 to the system, with exception for volcanoes. Volcanic activity has been stable and does not explain the CO2 concentration being higher than it has been in 3 million years. The billions of tons of carbon put into the atmosphere year by burning fossil fuels more than accounts for the increase in CO2. The only reason atmospheric CO2 isn't higher is that the oceans absorb a lot of it as well. 
Ice ages are on a scale of a hundred thousand years. The concern is about warming over the last 100 years that does not fit any natural cycle.

The website does not provide other causes for increasing CO2 and other GHGs. It mentions humans as the cause of rising GHG concentrations. It does note some parts of the cycle, but notes that natural parts tend to stay in balance, and that humans are the source of adding extra CO2.
You see, plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, other organisms consume the plants, and absorb that carbon. When carbon based life forms decompose it releases that CO2 back into the atmosphere. All natural. and part of a balance. Carbon is removed from this cycle naturally by sinking to the bottom of the ocean, and naturally added by volcanoes. Burning fossil fuels has added very old carbon, that hasn't been part of the cycle for millions of years. CO2 has recently hit 400ppm, a 3 million year high.

 Don't use stats from countries you don't understand (and don't understand how their stats are generated):

Statistical factors:
Unlike the majority of countries in Europe, crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification may be unclear.


In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape, it retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.


Sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a year, the Swedish police may record more than 300 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation",UCMA50xrF-hM0yjFYp-3gw9w,1.0,UggiUzF6vg0DaHgCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

Cook et al, 2013, found that out of all published papers in the time frame he analyzed, 97% that took a position one way or the other on warming stated that warming is occurring and human released CO2 contributes *to some degree*. 

Cook found that 1.6% of papers go further, saying both that warming is occurring and that human released CO2 is the main cause. In a later paper Bedford and Cook, 2013, he misrepresented the latter category as the former, claiming that his earlier paper showed 97% of papers claimed warming is occurring and human released CO2 was the main cause.

Treating 1.6% as 97% is misleading at best, a deliberate distortion at worst. 

Since then, more papers have tried to show through surveys that this number is a 90%+ majority, and I haven't reviewed those. To be honest, I don't really care too much about the majority view.

""The twenty-two studies cited above all agree that the impact of climate change is small relative to economic growth. This was found in studies by Professor William Nordhaus and Professor Samuel Fankhauser. It was confirmed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from its Second Assessment Report, in a chapter led by the late Professor David Pearce, to its Fifth Assessment Report, in a chapter led by me."" - Richard Tol

However, the Gallup poll you cite is two years old and there has been a lot more discussion about climate change in those two years, not to mention the advent of the Paris Agreements, which was historic. But even in the poll you cite, a combined 49% of people were concerned about climate change either a fair amount or a great deal. In other words, roughly half of all people WERE concerned about climate change. That's not anywhere near your allegation or implication that ""people don't care."" 

A more recent Gallup poll, one from this year, shows that those who are concerned about climate change either a fair or great amount has risen by 30% (or 15 percentage points) to 64%, to nearly two out of three. More and more people are seeing the results and effects of climate change and the deniers are in decline.

http://www.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx

A larger poll done by the Pew Research Center shows there is a more concern about climate change in other parts of the world. This poll is from April of this year (the Gallup Poll I cited was done a month earlier.)

“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy.

According to Stephen Jay Gould, ""there never was a period of 'flat Earth darkness' among scholars (regardless of how the public at large may have conceptualized our planet both then and now). Greek knowledge of sphericity never faded, and all major medieval scholars accepted the Earth's roundness as an established fact of cosmology.""[4] Historians of science David Lindberg and Ronald Numbers point out that ""there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference"".[5",UCxinOmWHtavyZ7zglu61-EQ,1.0,UggiVAAZWberO3gCoAEC,9UCdFbyL8y0,2016-05-03T03:57:03Z,climate crisis

Sea ice being water thats already in the ocean and therefore it doesn't raise sea levels. However its land ice eg glaciers that are the problem because that water isnt in the ocean so if it melts sea levels rise. The problem is that land ice has been getting smaller all over the globe. And the rate at which it is decreasing in getting faster. Now to why sea ice is getting bigger in antartica, right basically sea water is salty. However as a lot more land ice is melting it forms a layer less salty or fresh water on top of the salt water, now i hope we all know that salt lowers the freezing point of water right.

Let's say you're in a car a the top of the hill. You can go down the hill by the natural force of gravity.

When you put your foot on the gas pedal, you go faster. 

That's what's happening now.  We are observing a rapid increase that is not in line with the historical data, and it is as a result of stored carbon being dug up and burned and put into the atmosphere.

So, it can freeze and thaw all the time, but it's not going to really make that much of a difference.  In Antarctica, the sea ice freezes and thaws all the time. It's not the issue.

The temperature that ice freezes at is affected by the salt content of the water; the higher the concentration of salt, the lower the temperature the water must be for it to freeze. Because of higher temperatures, the freshwater glaciers melted and lowered the concentration of salt at the poles. As a result the water around the poles freeze at a higher temperature, which accounts for the greater amount of ice. We can tell because ice saples from the newly frozen ice, which by the way melts and refreezes every year, shows that the ice is now frozen saltwater not freshwater as it was before.

But in a more serious thought, the earth cycles through different weather patterns in about 100,000 year cycles. Carbon dioxide is the big enemy of climate change. We produce much less, even with our cars and factories, than when herds of large animals were roaming around in our distant past. The democrats cure for climate change is carbon tax. Wow that makes so much sense! More taxes will save the earth! Do I want a cleaner earth? Yes! Let's start with being dependent less on plastics, chemicals etc. China is really the one we should all be looking at. They want to tax SUV's, while china rapes and poisons the earth in more ways than imaginable. Also the EPA is one of the most corrupt branches of the government.

Old plant dies decays produces food for new plant and produces oxygen throughout its lifetime, we don't produce oxygen or as of late even decay in the ground for plants to consume ie embalming fluid caskets... one is toxic and stops you from decaying the other one takes hundreds of years to decay unless its metal then tens of thousands.

Lets assume only a quarter of that time is needed for the atmospheric gases to leech back into the soil and start making their way back into the crust. You are looking at over 10 million years for natural processes to return the planet to a pre civilization state. Your idea of plants overgrowing buildings and concrete being swallowed by the grass is flat out wrong, look at the temperatures plants need to survive they are hardier than us humans but at some point the greenhouse effect will turn the planet into an oven what plants do you know will survive in an oven?

They accept things with a tenacity proportional to the evidence for them.

Natural scientists also believed in ""ethers"" and phlogiston and a lot of nonsense.  The difference was, there was no clear method to distinguish sense from nonsense.

Sarah Palin alone was worth $12 million dollars in 2011, and during her time as a governor, 1 in 4 of all appointees were from the highest campaign donors. Including sweet state development deals for corporations. And now that she's not running for anything, she can happily demand even more money for these appearances.

If you knew anything about climate change, you would see that in the past twenty years, the RATE of temperature increase has become exponential. A post-ice age increase in temperature would occur over thousands of years, meaning a year-to-year temperature would stay almost constant for a very, very long time. In fact, the earth's rate of temperature increase became steeper as the industrial revolution got underway, and since then, and especially in the past twenty/thirty years, has absolutely skyrocketed. There is literally no credible scientific evidence to support the idea that climate change hasn't become much more rapid in the past few years, and the correlation between human activity and climate change is undeniable to any person of average intelligence.

Oil is a needed commodity for beyond the foreseeable future because of its diversity of products.even the alternative energy’s infrastructure so far cannot be made without the oil industry’s products. If we got rid of all fossil fuelled transportation, we would still need massive amounts of oil. So if the effort that is used to curtail the oil industry was put to actually funding and finding reasonable and working alternatives, we would be getting someplace, and there would be less people labeled deniers.

Over 8 million people die each year from fossil fuel air pollution, and millions more are harmed, making the health care costs almost incalculable. They destroy potable groundwater wells, destroy arable farmland, destroy metals in cities from acid rain and on and on and on. Considering all these factors, fossil fuels are not cheaper than most established renewables. Wind, in particular, is waaaay cheaper than all fossil fuels when all subsidies are removed from the fossil fuels and taking into account the societal costs.
Sure, the US has 1.2 million jobs in the fossil fuel industry, but how many millions of jobs are missed because they don't want to develop the renewables market? They would have the entire world as their costumers, especially Europe and parts of Asia.

An example: Denmark is the largest fossil fuel producer in the EU, but after the oil crisis in the 70's, they vowed to work towards never being reliant on other countries for such an important societal product. They developed the fossil fuel industry at home, while at the same time investing heavily in developing the technologies for wind power and other renewables, by using the money gained from the fossil fuels, because they knew the fossil fuels wouldn't last forever.
On the other hand, the UK had the same opportunity, but politically said wind was a waste of money, and didn't invest in it. The result? Denmark became the largest producer of wind turbines, making it the largest industry in the country and had at one point employed more people than any one industry in the country - almost 50,000 people at one point. This considering that there were only slightly over 5 million people in the entire country back then.
Over time, oil and gas revenues fell but renewables became bigger and bigger. It's still one of the largest industries in the country. Now Denmark has seen another opportunity to sell renewables to the rest of the EU, and at the same time helping other countries reach their CO2 reduction goals, by building a $34 billion artifical energy island, that will at full development power over 6 million homes - more than the entire population in Denmark. This same island will use excess wind power to power the largest hydrogen plant in the world; hydrogen that can be sold to other countries as a storage medium when wind and sun are insufficient, as well as creating artificial CO2 neutral carbon based fuels to power vehicles, planes and traditional powerplants.
How is this island funded, you may ask? 51% will be owned by the government and the 49% being owned by private enterprices, including the largest energy companies in the country (including current fossil fuel producers).

Many climate change deniers say ""but renewables are unreliable"". That's very true, but the country that can solve that very problem efficiently will become the undisputed leader and earner of an entire energy sector, just like large fossil fuel producing countries in the world are now, and just like Denmark became when they basically invented the commercial scale wind turbines.",UCD13X08rOrUeTqGVkpfDCxg,0.0,UgwY0vgLTsyQkaS2vyF4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

Spectroscopic analysis very clearly identifies heat passing through C02 in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth. The amount of heat radiating back is steadily increasing as our emissions increase.

Isotopic analysis also clearly identifies C02 from burning fossil fuels and differentiates it from natural C02. Thus we know that a substantial and growing level of C02 in the atmosphere has come from burning fossil fuels. Natural C02 is not increasing. Only fossil fuel C02 is. 

The blanket on your bed also takes up a tiny percentage of the atsmophere in your bedroom but does an amazing job of trapping your body heat and keeping you warm. C02 does not need to permeate the atmosphere to trap and re-radiate heat.

Here is the monstrous lie:

The ""scientific community""  endorses the pseudoscience of the -global warming-  ""climate change"" agenda with a nearly universal endorsement.  Exactly the opposite is the case. 

Apart from a few noisy unscrupulous crackpots like Jim Hansen and Michael Mann, the huge  majority of physicists, chemists, biologists, and economists condemn this fraud, often at a terrible personal expense.   The deep state punishes universities that allow real scientists to express the alarm that they are witnessing to what is being done to the good name of legitimate science.   The corporate press, and huge media control complexes such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, the MSM, Hollywood, and the government -educational- indoctrination complex have all piled onto this fraud.

In truth,  ""climatology"" is not a science anymore than the Guinness Book of Records is.  Climatology was a dull occupation of people who collected weather statistics from the past in order to condense ""average"" weather conditions for utilitarian purposes, primarily for agriculture and the weather insurance interests.   *Climatologists never claimed thy could predict future changes to their past collection of averages.* 

Climatology re-coined  as a predictive science for anticipating future ""average weather"" (climate) conditions is a complete fraud.  This not an overstatement.  Not one of their predictive models can beat my own and I am but a single amateur climate change prognosticator operating without a penny committed to my research.

My model for future ""world climate"" change is and always has been that there will be none at all within any period limited to a less than a half dozen lifespans or so.  So far, my model works far better than anything produced by the untold billions of taxpayer cash wasted on the fraud of climate change prediction;

Remember my model, simply stated as the x-axis of this graph itself, (zeros on the y-axis for all values of x)

Here is how my model has been verified to be correct

https://i1.wp.com/wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/uscrn-2005-2017.png?w=741&ssl=1

Note: This is the only scientifically justifiable assessment of surface temperature changes for the entire USA including Alaska and Hawaii, for which the USCRN (US Climate Reference Network)  was developed.  The USCRN is a network of scrupulously maintained, non-urbanized, geographically distributed, state-of-the-art  weather stations built and monitored since 2004.   No other such network exists on the Earth so it is the only legitimate proxy for average surface temperature change across the globe.

Please note how the average temperature hovers above and below the median but does not trend away from the median over the entire period the USCRN has existed.        

Now compare my model (zero change) with the untold billions wasted on these fraudulent ""models""

The western part of their country is so rife with solar panels and wind turbines that they're unable to use all of the energy they produce, which is why they're building a million volt line to connect west to east. 

China not only boasts the largest wind and solar farms in the world, they also build and buy the most electric cars, including almost all of the world's electric buses. They just initiated the world's largest carbon market, to incentivize the lowering of emissions, and they've planted 66 billion trees. They're hardly sitting on their hands. 

Yes, they burn way too much coal. China is a big energy ship to turn around. Eliminating coal won't happen overnight. However, China is on track to plateau its emissions before 2030 and is meeting its Paris agreements. Remember, America was allowed to develop and modernize unfettered by C02 restrictions. China is in the middle of their development and want the same luxuries and standards that we enjoyed throughout the 20th century.

We already have a damaging amount of sea level rise baked into the system from our warming. But that doesn't mean we ignore future flooding 50,100 or 150 years from now by failing to act now. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated,  we could see a one meter sea level rise by 2100. With steep reductions in fossil fuel burning, we could slash that in half, according to the IPCC. 

Each year of sea level rise gives storm surges and king tides higher platforms to launch from. A large storm surge can already flood miles inland. Shoreline cities and towns won't have to wait until complete inundation. According to FEMA, it takes only an inch of flooding in the average home to cause $25000 in damage. It's why Miami Beach has already spent a half a billion dollars elevating seawalls, moving buildings and raising 105 miles of roads and why New York has a new $10 billion-dollar flood mitigation project in the works. 

Half of our C02 emissions are NOT absorbed by plants or any other natural sinks. Plants are already absorbing all they can.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-stopped-getting-greener-20-years-ago/

In addition, the C02 benefit isn't quite what scentists originally thought it was after measuring NASA's satellite data a few years back. A new assessment has been made since, and it turns out that a large portion of the ""greening"" the satellites saw was from the planting of billions of trees by Chna, India and Europe, and not so much from natural C02-induced growth. 

Scientists have weighed both sides of this debate and have determined that the damage will be far greater than the benefits. There is no shortage of data showing that.",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1.0,Ugw4qyaqIHMgZRcmi8N4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

Now, there is NO WAY stop sea level rise, so efforts in that direction are nearly worthless. So, scratch that argument.
If you look at a map of the world, there is little arable farmland near the equator. Most of it is Sahara desert and a narrow neck of mountainous land in Central America. We arguably should be opting to maximize total farm production, which will come with more farmland growing higher yields due to the increase in CO2.

Here where I live near Seattle, the weeds are growing wildly. I must now regularly hack back overgrowing blackberry bushes due to the increased CO2. While this is an inconvenience, I see that this is really a good thing, as it is a part of increasing farm yields worldwide.

Hence, though I acknowledge the arguments of the Climate Change people, I also recognize the arguments of the so-called Deniers.

The big winners will indeed be countries in northern and far northern latitudes. Russia is delighted with what's happening. Not only do they end up with more farmland as the permafrost melts, the melting Arctic opens up new shipping lanes for them. 

I happen to live in an area that already has a mix of benefits and damage. Our shrimp fishery completely collapsed because of the warming waters but on the other hand winters have historically been brutal here and none of us is complaining about the milder temperatures and earlier springs now. Growng season has expanded by a full week, which is great news for farmers and gardeners. But on the other hand, ticks are now surviving the milder winters when they tended to die out before, so we now have the highest rates of Lyme Disease in the world. 
The disease is rampant here and because of its severity, it has stopped many of us from roaming the woods and fields as we used to. 

At the end of the day, the worldwide calculations of damage to benefits ratio is that there will be more damage than benefit, especially among the hundreds of millions of us who live along shorelines vulnerable to sea level rise. Throughout most of the 20th century, sea level rise averaged 1.5mm per year. Today it's 5mm per year and accelerating, according to the World Meteorological Organization. According to NOAA, high tide flooding along the American northeast has jumped 140% in just 20 years. It's up an astonishing 190% along the southeast. Where will it be 50 years from now?

Increasing heat in equatorial regions will also make growing crops there impossible. Many crops and plants have a heat limit, when photosynthesis, growth, and even germination of seeds stop. There is a temperature limit of what humans and animals will endure as well. 250 million years ago, high C02 drove temperatures to 140 degrees in equatorial regions and caused a mass extinction event.

The ice Ages last usually over 100 thousands years. The ""warming"" period such as the one we're in now last around 10,000-12,000 years or so..
We are currently 11,000+ years into our warming period before a next Ice age..
So the reality is should we hope that the Earth is warming and perhaps help push a coming Ice Age further into the future. Or should we want temps to go down.

The reality is, if Earth has like clockwork entered into cyclical ice age and warming periods, we ARE due for an Ice age in the near future.
This has to do with Earths Rotation around the sun and aphelion and perihelion etc etc.. When Earth is at it's longest away from the sun and remains leaning (lack of a better word) away from the sun longer. The snow and ice builds up over the years and it never fully melts.

Right now we really have some mixed weather taking place for the last 10 years. A lot more snow and cold snaps and flooding taking place. 

Now Even Texas having Winter storms. And Greece and Germany and Thames freezing, and Moscow with their worst winters in 10 years.. Weather not climate.. Sure. But when does it turn into climate and not just ""weather""..

No one is denying climate change, it has existed as long as Earth has had an Atmosphere.. It's more like many not believing the ALARMISM going around and that Earth is in extreme warming..
This includes THOUSANDS of scientists in the field.. So ask them.

Sad part for all groups there will be no winners.. Either we are in a new ice age within a few hundred years and the climate starting to change towards that. Or we are in a warming.
Choosing between them both I take some warming over Ice age.. The ice Age will be 100X worse for the whole planet.. But make no mistake. One or the other is going to happen.

Our national insurance program (which is already $20 billion in debt) will go bankrupt and insurance companies will fly the coup. 

Once the insurance companies bail, property owners will have no choice but to abandon their homes or wait for the next king tide or storm surge to destroy them. According to FEMA, it takes only an inch of flooding in the average home to cause over $25000 in damage.. Now multiply this by thousands of homes struck by a major storm surge at once. One inch of water is all it takes. 

A flooded city like New York can't just pick up all of its buildings, subways, roads, power lines, railways, utilities, factories, municipal facilities, businesses, apartments and homes and leave.  


Anyone putting a new building in a floodzone is a fool. Of course. But millions of buildings worldwide already sit in a floodzone, as floodzone maps have been redrawn due to the rising tide. 

Miami Beach provides an illustration of the costs involved in doing nothing about global warming. They've already spent a half a billion dollars on elevating seawalls, moving buildings and raising 105 miles of roads, and they're not done yet. Nor does any of this expensive work guarantee that they'll be safe from future flooding. The estimate for erecting seawalls around Florida's most vulnerable communities is $76 billion. Louisiana, $38 billion. North Carolina, $35 billion, Virginia, $31 billion.

Storm surges can flood several miles inland, and that will grow worse as time goes on.

Before life, in the pre-cambrian, carbon in the air was about 5000 ppm. Tree life on land locked its carbon up in coal. Life in the sea locked up its carbon in oil and carboniferous rocks such as chalk, limestone and marble which is limestone cooked at depth. If the carbon, residual in the air, ever drops to 160 ppm plant life on earth would cease and with it animals. There was a time when it reached 180 ppm. Close call. 
The CO2 in the air now is about 450 ppm. That increase is responsible for the current greening of the planet and the shrinking of the deserts. Plants have stomata under their leaves which take in carbon dioxide and exhaust water vapour. Increase the CO2 in the air and the number of stomata reduces which means that the water vapour exhausted is also reduced. The deserts shrink and the earth greens. Food is easier to grow with less water. 
When there is a future dearth of carbon in the air we will need to use solar furnaces to burn crushed limestone to make cement, giving off carbon dioxide to keep life on the planet well.......alive.",UC2c47OkugKxhwZ8_IHtjABA,0.0,Ugxgk-2g0Z3QKKLivUp4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

This plays on people ignorance because climates always change, the Sphinx we think saw alot more rain than is possible in a dessert, we find sea shells in deserts. Climate changing is nothing new but the extent as to which humans are responsible is what can be manipulated by people.

That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 produced in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible and yet we are told it is true. Lastly, carbon dioxide will increase only after temperatures rise and conversely CO2 levels drop as  temperatures cool.  In other words,  CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack there of and therefore does not drive climate but follows climate.",UClj5S7b1CP1_QpXGtAz3AQA,0.0,UgyTuFWFpmNKAqYn-EB4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

It's interesting to me that you'd post about the ancient past when Antarctica was a temperate forest.
Where do you think all that Antarctic ice went? 

In fact, it was so hot then that ALL of the world's icecaps melted and flooded what we now know as Canada and the United States with a shallow ocean called the Western Inland Sea, which remained for millions of years. It's why we find the fossils of sea creatures in Kansas. 

Such icecap melting today would inundate every coastal city in the world.

Knowing about the past and what happened is precisely why we are concerned about climate change today.

2. Nobody changed the term ""global warming"" to ""climate change."" ""Climate change"" has been used in scientific journals since the 1950s. They are two different things. Climate change is a more encompassing term because in addition to warming, it denotes all of the side effects that come with warming: migration of the rain/snow line, disturbance of the jet stream, changes in air and ocean currents, increases in extreme precipitation events, droughts, and wildfires, and intensification of hurricanes.
3. Wildfires have always happened.  Today they happen more often because global warming is accelerating evaporation, drying out tinder and vegetation and making it much more likely to ignite and spread. We have advanced fire-fighting equipment today and much earlier reporting when a fire breaks out; we have more access roads to reach fires, and air power to help control the flames, all things we did not have a century ago. 
4. Since 1995 there have been 18 above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, as measured by NOAA’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index. ACE calculates the intensity of a hurricane season by combining the number, wind speed and duration of each tropical cyclone. That’s the largest stretch of above-normal seasons on record. So while there aren’t necessarily more Atlantic hurricanes than before, those that form are getting stronger, with more Category 4 and 5 events.

Don't take my word for it. Here's NASA's opinion: https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/la09300d.html ""Ample physical evidence shows that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the single most important climate-relevant greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. This is because CO2, like ozone, N2O, CH4, and chlorofluorocarbons, does not condense and precipitate from the atmosphere at current climate temperatures, whereas water vapor can, and does. Non-condensing greenhouse gases, which account for 25% of the total terrestrial greenhouse effect, thus serve to provide the stable temperature structure that sustains the current levels of atmospheric water vapor and clouds via feedback processes that account for the remaining 75% of the greenhouse effect. Without the radiative forcing supplied by CO2 and the other non-condensing greenhouse gases, the terrestrial greenhouse would collapse, plunging the global climate into an icebound Earth state.""

Temperature is not driving C02 today. That's the fossil fuel industry's favorite meme, and it's unsupported by the scientific literature. C02 is driving temperature.

Water vapor also has “windows” that allow some of our infrared energy to escape without being absorbed. In addition, water vapor is concentrated lower in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 mixes well all the way to about 50 kilometers up. The higher the greenhouse gas, the more effective it is at trapping heat from the Earth’s surface.

C02-driven warming also accelerates evaporation, which fills the atmosphere with additional moisture which then acts synergistically with C02 to magnify warming further.

Their data shows that it is snowing less in more and more regions while it is snowing with greater accumulations in historically cold areas, far from any snow-rain line transition zone. Snowfall and snowpack have been falling for years in Europe, China,  the western U.S. and other regions. Europe has lost 12% per decade since the 1950s. I'll link you to the data below.

 Explanation: Warming accelerates evaporation, which fills the air with additional water vapor. For every one degree C rise in temperature, the air is able to hold 7% more moisture. This results in GREATER SNOW FALL in cold, northern areas but less in the shoulder seasons and southern areas, where the snow-rain transition line is migrating to the north. That means Canada will likely see MORE snow, not less. 

It's always easy to find places that experience record cold or record snow, but we don't measure global climate change by region or by short timelines. We measure averages across the entire planet, over large spans of time. Those averages clearly show marked drops in snow cover over the last several years, except in the very cold regions I mentioned.

However, what is new is that a large portion of this C02 is coming from the burning of fossil fuels, and we know that definitively from isotopic analysis of the C02 molecules themselves. 
(They have a unique signature that differentiates them from natural C02 molecules.) 

As we've added to the total C02 in the atmosphere, spectroscopic analysis reveals more and more longwave radiation or heat bouncing back to earth. From satellite measurements, we also see the atmospheric layer above ours COOLING. That's evidence of heat being trapped below and prevented from venting back into space. 

Neither the sun nor any heat source on earth can simultaneously warm the lower atmosphere while cooling the layer above it. Only a greenhouse effect can do that.

Nobody erased the Medieval Warm Period. The Medieval Warm Period was neither global, globally synchronous nor multidecadal. Today's warming is all three.

Again, blame conservative media outlets for cooking up a controversy from misinformation. The very famous schematic showing the distinctive BUMP in temperature during the MWP was produced by a climate scientist by the name of Hubert Lamb. But the data seen in that graph only includes temperatures from central England and western Europe, not the entire world. Furthermore, the schematic actually ends in 1950, leaving off our very warmest decades.

The Medieval Warm Period was indeed warm but it wasn't warmer than today GLOBALLY. The MWP warming was produced by the North Atlantic Oscillation combined with a period of very low volcanic activity, which bears no relation to the warming happening today.

Your first four numbered responses are too vague to discern what you're referring to. 

As to #5, nobody needs to be a god when they dig up remnants of ferns from a swampy, temperate forest in Antarctica to determine that the area was once far warmer than it is today.
Ditto alligator remains from the Arctic Circle. Ditto locating glacial dropstones to determine how close the glaciers got to the equator 650 million years ago. We don't need to be a god to figure that the massive blanket of basalt that covers Siberia must have come from long-term, extreme volcanic activity, which would have spewed trillions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere and made global temperatures skyrocket. Dating the basalt to a mass extinction event 250 million years ago provides further clues. 

There is no shortage of methods of determing climate from the ancient past. An astonishing amount of information can be gleaned from simple deep-sea benthic foraminifera, which preserve the record of Earth's past climate in their oxygen- and carbon-isotope compositions.  

As to #6, I never implied that the sun is the only factor that can cause temperatures to rise. However, it is the only major warming factor, besides greenhouse gases, that is both global in influence and multidecadal in duration, whereas the North Atlantic Oscillation is only regional and El Nino only brief in its influence.

We cannot base policies on wild claims like this.
Check again NASA DATA from the million of years perspective, like ""Changes in the Carbon Cycle"" or the estimated Temps on last 500 million years at Climate.gov. 

Even with ZERO human interaction earth will keep changing radically, our existences its nothing but a flick of dirt considering earth ""age"" and how it will end.  

1) =/= AGW
2) =/= AGW (Jesus F crist, consider how old is earth again please)
3) CO2 Emission dropped when major changes went from dino juice to natural gas. We can do better so i agree half way. There's a massive increase on CO2 consumers on earth and CO2 on ATM SHOULD be strongly monitored disregarding the AGW.
4) See Nº3, Dino juice shift to natural gas made emisión go lower. 
5) BS, unless you are a literal god you cannot tell how and why Tº change million years ago. What you meant was ""data we gather for X amount of times indicates this"" (See NASA carbon Cycle)that provides itself one of the many variants.
6. Sun it's not the only factor that applies on earth Tº, like biden said ""man come on"". You just get overly simplistic.


Anyway, i bet you and me are not running against lowering the impact we have on earth, we strongly disagree on how and why. Unless scientific method provides a total solid and empirical evidence about it, its just a ""consensus"", that's another way to say ""we think and cannot prove"" about AGW. But this does not change we should keep doing R&D for the best of mankind.

1. Spectroscopic analysis clearly shows heat passing through C02 in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth, so we know a greenhouse effect exists. 
2. As our lower atmosphere has warmed, the atmospheric layer just above it has cooled, according to NASA monitoring since 1978. That means less heat is escaping from below, further evidence of that greenhouse effect. And natural cycles can't explain why satellites measure less heat escaping to space at the precise wavelengths which CO2 absorbs (Philipona 2004, Wang 2009).
3. Isotopic analysis of our atmospheric C02 further shows that a large and growing portion of it originated specifically from the burning of fossil fuels. 40% of our emissions, in fact are not absorbed by plants or other natural sinks each year but are simply left to accumulate in the atmosphere. C02 molecules can not only accumulate and remain up there for decades, but for centuries at a time, and that's the crux of our problem. 
4. Our C02 emissions have increased since the start of the Industrial Revolution. As C02 increased, so did warming. C02 tracks with warming throughout history, dating back millions of years.
5. Major warmings of the past were always caused by one of two things: gradual changes in earth's orbit, axial tilt and precession (Milankovitch Cycles) or massive tectonic upheaval from the break-up of continents. Neither of these factors is in play today and in fact all three Milankovitch Cycles are in cooling phases, not warming ones. 
6. The sun's last three cycles progressively weakened, reducing its heat output slightly, yet we continued to warm anyway.",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1.0,Ugz09mN1y7qv1y9qwcN4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

""hurr durr lets invest trillion of dollars and maybe it will change this little Tº, otherwise it will be worse in X years just like Y amount of time we said this before on many decades and was overstimated"" - Its like taking messures against earthquakes and volcano preventions or many other comic events pretending we have full knowledge about it.

 The data we actually have cover a time so short in climatic terms thats is almost useless, ALMOST. Even if we scan for millions of years thanks to permafrost or deep ground research you can actully just ""get"" an idea of how the Tº was, not the actuall and exact reason. 

Theres so many factors OUT of HUMAN control that makes the meassures just a shot in the dark. 

Solar flares, atmosphere, celestial bodys, earthquakes, volcanos, forest fires, nuclear radiation, electrosphere changes, slow on earth rotation, sun diying, etc. If you dare to actually say that we fully understand what the problem is, what causes it and how to fix it, thats actually deniying empi evid.

https://youtu.be/ewJ6TI8ccAw

and also quite difficult to defend, because not only CO2 is a very shallow greenhouse gas (nothing like methane or water vapor), but it is also present in minimal amounts (1960 --> 0.031%; today --> 0.042%).
In the remote past there were periods with much higher amounts (40 millions years ago --> 2200 ppm) and obviously no human activities (why?).
More over: there were periods in which the concentrations of CO2 rised and the temperatures went down, and vice versa. 
This happens because even if there is correlation between the average temperature and the concentration of CO2, correlation doesn't mean causation. 
There is also correlation between the average annual consumption of chocolate and the win of the Nobel prize. 
Should we therefore recommend the people to eat more chocolate in order to increase the probability of winning the Nobel prize? 

The global warming is caused by a general increase in the solar activity (nothing we can do anything to stop).

If someone doesn't want to change the composition of the atmosphere for ethic reasons, this can be for sure understood, and we already have powerful industrial technologies, able to extract heavy amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere (the utilization of which is beginning in these years).
This hoax is probably made just in order to hit economical interests of Russia and of the middle east.

Another very important point to understand about CO2, is that it is NECESSARY FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS!! 
Without it, plants couldn't live. 
Imagine it: we remove all the CO2 from the atmosphere and all plants die (it is at the base of life --> in fact we use to call life ""carbon based life""). 
It is already present in minimal amounts, and adding a little bit of it probably lets only plants grow a little bit faster (makes the world greener).",UCRyfiq5jkgMRP1l1ZiK9Rjw,0.0,Ugyadm_98fU1glDZtc54AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

That's the current worldwide comparison, and that's why more wind turbines are being adopted. People blame high energy costs in Germany on solar and wind power but that, in fact, doesn't tell the whole story.

The renewable energy surcharge makes up one-fifth of a German citizen's electric bill, but the surcharge stems from renewable prices locked in by contract years ago. Solar and wind are far cheaper than they were when the contracts were agreed upon, but the contracts must be honored for 20 years. The contracts don't end until the 2030s. 
 
Unlike most countries, Germany put almost all of its powerlines underground; that's more expensive to achieve and to maintain. 

German households pay higher rates than large businesses do, who are exempt from renewable energy taxes, so a household to household comparison with other European countries would not give an accurate assessment of overall rates. 

Americans pay 2.15% of their disposable income on electricity each year; Germans pay just slightly more at 2.3% 

When counted in real terms, the country actually ranks in the middle field compared to fellow EU states. In Bulgaria, for example, power prices are only one third of those in Germany. But power outages are not only much more common, Bulgarians also on average earn only one ninth of what people earn in Germany, newspaper Tageszeitung has reported. 

A portion of German electricity levies are funneled back into the nation's retirement funding. Unlike that of most other countries, part of the German power bill ends up back in a German citizen's pocket as retirement income. 

In Germany, industries as well as private consumers have adopted savings strategies, like buying energy-efficient appliances or switching to low-energy light bulbs. Over the past 20 years, German households have reduced their energy consumption by 10 percent, while the respective rate in the United States increased by 20 percent. In 2014, an average German household used less than a third of the power of its US equivalent, and also less than an average household in other major industrialised countries in Europe, such as France, Britain, or Spain.",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1.0,Ugyadm_98fU1glDZtc54AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

I see all the time trucks transporting those huge blades. And I started wondering how much does it cost to dismount and remount them all the time when they break for some reason. 
In fact, later on, the information started going around, that Germany did manage to shut down all its nuclear power plants by replacing them with those giant wind generators, but the costs are unfortunately (much) higher, and the state is loosing lots of money in order to keep those things running, whereas nuclear energy was cheap and could even be sold. 
And you know, this is also obvious: if I have a nuclear power plant, it is only 1; whereas, if I have 300 wind generators, I have a huge and complex infrastructure to take care of!

First of all, I forgot to tell you that you are talking with an electronic engineer. So, I think I can say that I have a scientific background. 
Then, if you also watch carefully this video:

https://youtu.be/WC8z9GTQOYA

you will find a serious and detailed costs calculation of operating eolic energy power plants (maintenance is also difficult and pricey).
Basically, it seems that there is no solution regarding costs. 
If you are right, as I do not assume, we will have either to stop emitting CO2 or start collecting it.

these videos were published 1 year ago. 
These devices can remove 1 Megaton of CO2 per year (1.000.000 of tons!) at the cost of $150 / ton. 
The cost would be very high but basically it shouldn't be done for ever. 
If a sufficient amount of these devices are installed we could clean up the atmosphere quite fast (and then maybe die for the arrival of a new ice age).
Anyway, if we look at alternatives (Wind/Solar) they are also not cheap and they don't remove any released CO2.
It has been accurately calculated that the total production costs of eolic energy are about 48% higher than burning coal. 
That would also be a colossal expense. 
More over, eolic/solar energy is uncomfortable, since it cannot be shut down or turned on when needed: the generators produce when they want to (only the probability can be calculated).
Regarding the USA, as far as I know, they have started using alternative extraction methods, since conventional reservoirs are running out. Now: the total amount is still sufficient, but the rate at which petrol can be extracted in this way is too slow and thus economically not convenient.",UCRyfiq5jkgMRP1l1ZiK9Rjw,1.0,Ugyadm_98fU1glDZtc54AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

Technological schemes to remove C02 are only in demonstration phases and aren't ready to be deployed on a large scale.

Here's the explanation for the unique instance when a glaciation ocurred during a period of high C02: https://skepticalscience.com/co2-higher-in-past.htm

C02 is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere because, unlike water vapor, it doesn't precipitate out. C02 molecules, by contrast, stay up there for centuries and accumulate. Methane is also fleeting because it combines with oxygen and processes into C02 after about 8 years. 

CO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the atmosphere, and water vapor can vary from 0 to 4%. But while water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, it has “windows” that allow some of the infrared energy to escape without being absorbed. In addition, water vapor is concentrated lower in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 mixes well all the way to about 50 kilometers up. The higher the greenhouse gas, the more effective it is at trapping heat from the Earth’s surface.

Yes, C02 takes up a small amount of atmospheric space. The blanket on your bed also takes up a small amount of space in your bedroom but does a great job of keeping you warm.",UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg,1.0,Ugyadm_98fU1glDZtc54AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

Americans per capita still spew more C02 annually than the Chinese do, and the lion's share of the accumulated C02 in the atmosphere today actually came from the U.S., not China. We led the world in emissions for over a century, which means we should take more responsibility for what's already there. Keep in mind that China has four times the population of the U.S., but most Chinese don't own cars. Most Americans do. Americans burn up far more resources than the average Chinese and, worse, American companies have their goods manufactured there (Apple, Nike, Levis, Mattel, Black and Decker and hundreds more) to be sold here, so that industrial pollution also partially belongs to us. 

Nobody is doing more than China to develop renewable energy. The western part of their country is so rife with solar panels and wind turbines that they're unable to use all of the energy they produce, which is why they're building a million volt line to connect west to east. 

China not only boasts the largest wind and solar farms in the world, they also build and buy the most electric cars, including almost all of the world's electric buses. They just initiated the world's largest carbon market, to incentivize the lowering of emissions, and they've planted 66 billion trees. They're hardly sitting on their hands. 

Yes, they burn way too much coal. China is a big energy ship to turn around. Eliminating coal won't happen overnight. However, China is on track to plateau its emissions before 2030 and is meeting its Paris agreements. Remember, America was allowed to develop and modernize unfettered by C02 restrictions. China is in the middle of their development and want the same luxuries and standards that we enjoyed throughout the 20th century. Take a look at the links below, detailing everything China is doing to reduce its emissions.

Proxies do not show temperature in precise ranges. In fact, most proxies show CLIMATE, not temperature. Temperature reading instruments do not show climate. They show ONLY temperature.

As an example, you can have a climate where the temperature is perfect, but rainfall is low causing a tree ring to be small where it should be big. YET they try to claim that they show the same thing. IF you use tree rings to current day, you find that they do not show an increase in temperature, because the climate does not match temperature.

Ice cores can be affected by many things as well, so they can not show precise temperature. There are some things that do show temperature fairly well, such as microbes that change their shape dependent on the temperature of the water they were in in their short life span. Unfortunately, this is also affected by where they traveled in the current they were in. Since currents do change, and it is impossible to know where the microbes traveled, it is not a precise meter. YET the alarmist refuse to use it, because it is fairly good, but does not show a warming trend over the last few decades.

There was NEVER a point where the proxies and instruments matched. There was a period of about 40 (1910-1950) years where they had SIMILAR patterns, but nothing precisely matching. That means they have no proof that the instruments can be linked to the proxies.

The Pages 2K Network study, involving 79 scientists from around the world, also trace temperature back 2000 years. They compared 30-year periods going all the way up to our 1971-2000 time-frame. The study found that our 1971-2000 time-frame was warmer than the last 1400 years.  When the 30-year span from 1982-2012 is calculated, instead of the 1971-2000 period, we are warmer than any other time period dating back  2000 years.  https://skepticalscience.com/pages2k-confirms-hockey-stick.html (Go to the bottom of the linked explanation to see the 1982-2012 add-on.) 

If the troposphere is steadily warming then the stratosphere should also be warming. Yet it isn't. Its cooling. A compilation of surface measurements of downward longwave radiation found an increasing trend of more longwave radiation returning to earth, attributed to increases in air temperature, humidity and atmospheric carbon dioxide (Wang 2009). More heat radiating back, less heat escaping to space. Pretty simple. 

 An analysis of high resolution spectral data has also allowed scientists to quantitatively attribute the increase in downward radiation to each of several greenhouse gases (Evans 2006).  Such analysis provides pretty clear proof of our growing greenhouse effect and from which gases.  



What you don't seem to understand, Robert, is that we were in a Milankovitch-driven cooling period for over 2000 years, leading right up until the industrial Revolution, when the trend reversed. The Milankovitch Cycles didn't suddenly reverse themselves. C02 simply overpowered nature's course. The Little Ice Age is completely irrelevant.

I do not know where you got the information that less heat is escaping because that is the reverse of what it shows. At one point NASA tried to use the fact that more infrared is leaving the planet as proof of co2 increasing in the upper atmosphere.

Yes, the small areas of infrared that co2 absorbs is decreasing BUT it is increasing in the area it emits. Co2 emits over a much larger area than it absorbs.

It does not matter what caused the little ice age, because what it was, was a period where the earth was UNUSUALLY cold for the part of the cycle we were in. Since then it has warmed to near the normal. Trying to claim that the coldest part of the last 12000 years is normal is ludacris.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03155-x

One salient point to keep in mind is that the Holocene Maximum had the benefit of earth's axial tilt in its favor, at 24 degrees, while today it's 23.4. That means that the northern hemisphere during the Max received more solar insolation, which sped up the melting of ice, releasing C02 and methane and reducing albedo. Axial tilt has been steadily decreasing and we should be COOLING now, not warming. That we have surpassed the Max without benefit of axial tilt should illustrate just how powerful today's warming is.

As I stated in my previous post, all three Milankovitch Cycles are in cooling phases now, not warming ones, as you suggest. (""Based on the position of the cycle we are in."")

Knowing exactly what phases the Milankovitch Cycles are in is crucial to understanding where our warming is coming from and where it isn't. It's equally important to know the causes of the Little Ice Age: an extended period of volcanic activity (Miller et al), magnified by a half a degree drop from the Maunder Minimum.

We have every proof that C02 is causing today's warming,  via spectroscopic and isotopic analysis. Natural cycles can't explain why NASA satellites since 1978 have measured less heat escaping to space at the precise wavelengths that CO2 absorbs (Philipona 2004, Wang 2009).

Americans per capita still spew more C02 annually than the Chinese do, and the lion's share of the accumulated C02 in the atmosphere today actually came from the U.S., not China. We led the world in emissions for over a century, which means we should take more responsibility for what's already there.

Keep in mind that China has four times the population of the U.S., but most Chinese don't own cars. Most Americans do. Americans burn up far more resources than the average Chinese and, worse, American companies have their goods manufactured there (Apple, Nike, Levis, Mattel, Black and Decker and hundreds more) to be sold here, so that industrial pollution also partially belongs to us.

Nobody is doing more than China to develop renewable energy. The western part of their country is so rife with solar panels and wind turbines that they're unable to use all of the energy they produce, which is why they're building a million volt line to connect west to east. China not only boasts the largest wind and solar farms in the world, they also build and buy the most electric cars, including almost all of the world's electric buses. They just initiated the world's largest carbon market, to incentivize the lowering of emissions, and they've planted 66 billion trees. They're hardly sitting on their hands.

Yes, they burn way too much coal. China is a big energy ship to turn around. Eliminating coal won't happen overnight. However, China is on track to plateau its emissions before 2030 and is meeting its Paris agreements. Remember, America was allowed to develop and modernize unfettered by C02 restrictions. China is in the middle of their development and want the same luxuries and standards that we enjoyed throughout the 20th century. Take a look at the links below, detailing everything China is doing to reduce its emissions. Contrary to the talk of conservative media outlets, it's far more than most countries are doing.

19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record. 2020 tied for first.
THE ICE SHEETS WILL MELT
All of the world's ice sheets and 90% of its glaciers are melting at rates unprecedented in recorded history.
SEA LEVEL WILL RISE
Average sea level rise throughout most of the 20th century hovered around 1.5mm per year. In the 90s it jumped to 3mm per year. Over the past five years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, it jumped to 5mm per year.
HIGH TIDE FLOODING WILL INCREASE
According to NOAA, high tide flooding along the U.S. northeast has increased 140% in the last 20 years. It's up an astonishing 190% along the southeast.

Extreme precipitation events have not only increased worldwide, in the U.S. northeast they increased over 50% since 1960, according to the EPA. They increased 30-40% over the south, midwest and northern plains. 
HURRICANES WILL INCREASE AND INTENSIFY
Hurricanes actually haven't increased but they have intensified. Category 1 and 2 storms have decreased while category 4 and 5 storms have increased.

China is the real threat when it comes to pollution and consumption of coal then we are.

Deforestation is a far bigger concern in regards to climate change.  And no one seems to be talking a bout that in our government. This documentary went all out against republicans and big oil.   Cutting down rain forests that the US has nothing to do with has far more reaching consequences then using fossil fuels. 

Eventually cars semi trucks etc will all be ran on electric.  But as far as oil goes,  our entire daily lives depend on oil in one way or another.  Almost everything we use each day has a tie to oil.  Plastics is used everywhere, our roads use asphalt bitumen.. The fuel for planes,  giant ships etc.  These can't use electric (batteries / solar)  and those are the biggest polluters by far,.  The united states is the largest consumer and producer of oil and right now we are energy intendent with exports, thats a good thing for our security.  There are 7.8 Billion people in the world, and solar, wind etc are not going to replace what oil gives us for many years if ever.  

A 747 jet uses 1 gallon of fuel every second.  There are thousands flying every day.  And you can't replace all that with electric engines powered by a battery yet.

 If Oil ran out tomorrow expect the world population to drop drastically within a few years.  Our modern society and food distribution etc is built on a house of cards with oil at the bottom.  Do we need to get off of it, yes.  But I don't think climate change is the reason or if fossil fuels is the cause of it.  Earth goes through changes naturally,  think ice age?   Ice ages come to an end world temp rises ice melts.  

 And even if the united states got rid of oil completely within 5 years,  what about China who burns more coal then rest of the world combined and has 372 million cars on the road.  China has 1.4 Billion people United states has 328 million.  So how are the climate change people going to go after the real issue that is China when it comes to all of this and not just punish ourselves or the companies that employ  millions of Americans.

 Nuclear is the only option for power generation that has zero emissions and reliable.  Solar needs the sun,  wind needs wind.. hydro electric has its own issues with blocking rivers.  Everything else is dependent on something that makes it not reliable, so that means power outages and shortages.  Batteries will have its own environmental issues with  recycling and disposal since their life is limited and it uses natural resources and minerals that are limited.

Just look at the caption, ""The big business of climate change denial"". First, no one denies that the earth's climate does not change, so just maybe it is time for the environmentalists to start changing their language terminology and get real. We know that the earth's climate goes through warming and cooling cycles. But generally, it takes thousands to millions of years for a dramatic change in the world's climate. The planet is about 4.5 billion years old. A thousand years is like the blink of an eye to the earth. It does not help the issue that there are a lot of so-called climate experts stating stupid things like, ""We only have 10-12 years to dramatically change our ways and go to a totally green energy plan."" Fossil fuels are not the sole reason for the change of the earth in temperature. The biggest source of heating for the earth is the sun. I am sure 100% of scientists would agree to that fact. The approach should be to realistically adopt green energy like wind turbines, solar, geothermal where it makes sense. Do not discount nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas and yes oil where those forms of energy make more sense. Consumers and businesses should be more conscious of how their choices affect the earth's ecosystem. For example, a modern diesel farm combine produces almost 0 emissions, in Alberta, the government assisted in the development of a new low sulphur diesel fuel refinery to reduce emissions from diesel fuel using vehicles. There are responsible car manufacturers that produce very fuel-efficient ICE vehicles that get terrific gas mileage and are affordable/Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Mazda 3, for example, get 40 mpg on the highway. Do people need a vehicle with 300 HP? The affordability of green energy has to be a factor in the adoption of green energy. If the cost of electricity triples for consumers just because it is green it will not work. Let's also not be naive and admit certain environmentalist do use manipulated data in their claims and their motivation is monetary in making those claims. Green energy is becoming big business and the profit margins are large.

Its climate waxes and wanes with its orbital eccentricity (among the highest of all the planets), axial tilt,  dust storms, changes in albedo, and icecap extent. Your suggestion assumes the sun must also be warming, yet its last three cycles actually weakened. 

Spectroscopic analysis clearly identifies heat passing through C02 in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth. Isotopic analysis clearly identifies a large portion of this C02 coming directly from the burning of fossil fuels, not nature. Further, as our lower atmosphere has warmed, the atmospheric layer just above it has cooled, according to NASA satellite monitoring since 1978.  That's not the only evidence of a greenhouse effect trapping heat below, though. Satellites are measuring less heat escaping to space at the precise wavelengths which C02 absorbs. 

Neither the sun nor any warming source on earth can simultaneously warm the lower atmosphere while cooling the upper one. Only a greenhouse effect can do that. 

The Medieval Warm Period was neither global, globally synchronous, nor multidecadal.Today's warming is all three. The MWP was generated by the North Atlantic Oscillation and a low period of volcanic activity, not C02.

Would it make more sense to spend X$ on increasing our national productivity instead, with the idea being that our increased productivity will allow us to deal with the effects of climate change?

Unfortunately we can't change the system in one day and we can't just dump oil and gas overnight. The world would starve without this energy. Second - it's not the oil that is the problem, it's the CO and CO2 that is the problem! CO and CO2 can be captured and there is significant technological improvement in that regard as well. Third - Australia is indeed a mess. That is probably one country that has absolutely no excuse not to develop wind and solar energy system. Gas stoves on the other hand is arbitrary as burning gas directly (and btw it's not pure gas, there is a lot of oxygen in it) could actually be more ecofriendly than using an electric heater that gets electricity from... coal! That is the worst thing you can do. The only way electric heaters are valid is when electricity for it comes from green source such as the sun or wind turbine or hydro or even nuclear PP. Btw - that is another source of enormous energy that is now being destroyed in countries such as Germany. That is an extremely bad and stupid idea. One could argue destruction of nuclear PPs is very beneficial to oil industry. 
So, all in all - the world needs energy and it's all about the energy. The demand grows and we as society cannot seem to restrain ourselves from using it in excess. Lets be honest - we use too much of it! We buy useless stuff we don't need without thinking that there is a factory that burns electricity (energy) to produce that stuff. And the only reason it does that is because we demand that stuff. Ultimately, it is our collective responsibility as well.

2. Solar and wind are the cheapest energy sources on earth. New battery storage technology is rapidly making the intemittency challenges for both a thing of the past. Nobody with a reasonable education is advocating the complete elimination of fossil fuels, only that needed to bring C02 emissions down to safer levels. 
3. The sea doesn't rise by magic. In order for that to happen, the icecaps must melt, which they are doing. The rate of rise averaged 1.5mm per year throughout most of the 20th century and has accelrated to 5mm per year now. What does it mean? It means that each new year of rise gives storm surges and king tides higher platforms to launch from. (The storm surge from Hurricane Sandy did $19 billion in damage in New York and wiped out parts of their subway system. ) Queens, New York is already experiencing regular high tide flooding. So is Annapolis, Maryland, and many other coastal cities. By 2100, as sea level continues to accelerate, some cities will be partially inundated. Permanently. 
4. Yes, my friend, ""adapting"" to the changes is exactly what we need to do now. Each decade we wait to mitigate the damage, the more expensive it will be down the road. Part of that ""adaption"" strategy is reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.

That’s fossil fuels. You asked me about predictions made 20 years ago and that’s what I mentioned. Of course no “ climate scientist” predicts 20 foot sea rise today because they know it’s wrong. And as far as sea rising 140-190% what does that mean? If it usually rises at 1 mm a year but because of global warming it’s now rising 2.9 mm a year? Still pretty insignificant. I would think humans could either find technologies that could save their land. They did it in the Netherlands. Or are the seas rising because the land is sinking? Again, I’m not saying things aren’t changing. But want I am saying is we have all the money and know-how to adapt to the changes that are not really that catastrophic. We shouldn’t demonize fossil fuels because the fact is we still use over 80% to power this country. We need it now more than ever. The price of energy reflects on the price of everything. You still need energy to make and build renewables and you need energy to back up renewables when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. If you don’t you’ll have blackouts. If a hospital is affected by a blackout they would need generators powered by fossil fuels to keep people alive.   Deaths from climate related events are down 99% from 100 years ago because we have utilized cheap, reliable, readily available energy. So it’s not just about luxury and lifestyle.

You're scoffing at your own misinformation. However, they did warn that it would rise and accelerate, which it is indeed doing. Throughout most of the 20th century, sea level rise hovered around 1.5mm per year and then jumped to 3mm per year in the 1990s and to 5mm per year now. According to NOAA, high tide flooding along the American northeast has increased 140% in the last 20 years. It's up an astonishing 190% along the southeast. It's the reason Miami has elevated seawalls, moved buildings and raised over 105 miles of roads and why New York has a new $10 billion-dollar flood mitigation project in the works. 
2. Sea levels are rising because the icecaps are melting at rates unprecedented in human history. They're melting because global warming concentrates at the poles. Although the average global temperature may have only risen two degrees, average winter temperature in Anchorage and Fairbanks has risen 8 degrees F in the last 50 years. 
3.

#AlGore and #BillNye are climate change Deniers compare to me.  However, Anthropogenic Global Warming is a Hoax.  Anthropogenic Climate Change is complete nonsense. 

Carbon dioxide is trace levels in your atmosphere at 400 ppm.  Furthermore, it only holds heat for a few seconds. Therefore CO2 is not the thermostat that controls our climate on this planet. 
Carbon dioxide is completely ineffective at driving Climate.  

History even records climate change... we all have seen climate change from the three major Ice-ages recorded in history to the subsequent warming periods (which were the Medieval Warming Period & the Roman Warming Period). 

However, Anthropogenic global warming is a complete Hoax. CO2 has nothing to do with creating global warming. CO2 Is currently 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. 
Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 produced in a year. 

CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible and yet we are told it is true. Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise and conversely CO2 levels drop as 
temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack there of and therefore does not drive climate but follow climate.

You do not appear to be cognizant of the treaty process as it works in the USA.  From the very beginning, after humiliating King Georges forces, our founders were very much opposed to ""foreign entanglements""

The treaty process works like this in the USA:  the executive branch engages and negotiates with other countries in pursuit of some perceived mutual benefit.   (Keep this in mind, as a nation we are not to be ""friendly"" with other nations, or at least that was the goal, anymore than you or I would call our banker a ""friend."")
   
After some agreed upon terms have been documented and signed by the Executive, the instrument is brought before the US Senate who is, or at  least was, supposed to serve as a watchdog over an errant Executive with equal representation in this oversight by all 50 states.  There the proposed treaty is examined to make certain the proposal is not unwholesome to the many states individual interests as well as to the federal apparatus as a whole.

After lengthy debate allowing each state to air its concerns the document is put to a vote requiring 67 of 100 Senators to indicate Aye.   The Treaty is then documented in formal legislation.  Its about as easy to ratify a treaty in the USA as it is to amend our constitution, the last time that occurred, was 42 years ago.   

Thus the Kyoto protocol proudly brought back by the Clinton regime went down with 1 aye to 99 nays in the Senate.   (there is always one idiot) .   

Obama did not even dare drag his Paris Agreement document in front of the Senate.

Such un-ratified agreements carry the same weight as a carnival barker's guarantee.  The senescent and enfeebled petty swindler Biden's signature carries the same weight - zero.  

Thus we never broke either of these worthless treaties since we were never a party to them.   This makes us completely trustworthy and unlike most of the signatory nations whose actions in screwing their own populations have gone largely ignored since claiming partyship to the agreements.     

Australia, China, and Germany share this in common, their ""demon coal"" per capita consumption of coal is not only far larger than that of the USA but  continues to rise at a rapid rate while ours as a non-signatory have plunged with each passing year.

710,UgxHSNXrpwhGSyzJiq94AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-02-01T10:39:15Z,Jeff Harmed,"Carbon taxes are folly. Deforestation is the problem. Reforestation or land set aside the solution. I’ve witnessed it with my own eyes. 

Born and bred in Africa I witnessed much of the climate change in Zimbabwe as forests were cut down for grain and tobacco cultivation and 80% of the land changed to grassland and semi-desert. The EU land set aside restores nature’s powers over the climate, fixing carbon dioxide and stabilising temperatures and rainfall.  Why else is earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide just 0.04% when it straddles between Venus and Mars orbits each planet with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 90%? Carbon dioxide is not the demon, it is plant food and plants work for us providing us with food and controlling our climate to be most favourable for life. Carbon dioxide and fossil fuels are just side actors, just like police cars and ambulances are to accident scenes. Just because police cars and ambulances are present at every accident scene does not mean that they caused them. The same with carbon dioxide and fossil fuels, they were mere agents of deforestation but deforestation was the cause of environmental changes. 

So the solution to gaining control over our environment is strengthening nature. 

The first method can be used by you personally to indirectly alter the climate for the better. Change to a keto or paleo diet and minimise your carbohydrate intake. This will not only improve your health and eliminate T2D, but more importantly it will incentivise farmers to plant trees which bind soils and provide nuts and seeds for your keto diet. If you choose a high carbohydrate diet, farmers will respond by cutting down forests to grow grain for your food. So by altering your food intake to a keto or paleo diet, you alter the food chain and thus ultimately the climate. 

See the best keto diet here https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ

The second (macro) solution can bring about climate improvement is as follows. 

1) Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests

2) Use cattle herds to revitalise soil
https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI

3) Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests

4) Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels

https://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU

5) Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain

6) Use minerals to assist salmon populations

Hahaha, that link is extremely funny. Do you actually clicked on the links with the predictions or did you just like the headline and didn't read it? Let take a look at some and keep in mind what I asked for:  scientific predictions. Number 47 is about a show that puts participants in something that might be the future. Very scientific. Maybe they could also add the film 2012 to the list, that is also a failed ""prediction"". Number 27 is not a failed prediction. It was just a remark about the importance of the climate summit in pairs that started 500 days after that comment. Number 24 says that the UK PM said something but isn't named in the article. Number 23: since when is Prince Charles a climate scientist? Number 15 is a news article in the Canberra Times of around 100 words. Wow, that probably summarises the science probably amazing. 

What an amazing way to make you point. I asked for scientific predictions. Why don't you discussed actual scientific predictions? Did you ever read one? I will help you, this paper actually looks at the performance of past climate models and shows that they are pretty accurate. 
Hausfather, Z., Drake, H. F., Abbott, T., & Schmidt, G. A. (2020). Evaluating the performance of past climate model projections. Geophysical Research Letters, 47(1), e2019GL085378.

Oh, btw, Al Gore isn't a scientists and didn't perform scientific research. So I don't care about what he is saying. 

And sorry to bring up actual facts again. From 65 to 79 a literature research found 7 papers predicting  cooling, 20 neutral, and 44 papers predicting warming. So less than 10% of the papers predicted cooling. Those papers often don't deny warming caused by greenhouse gasses, they only overestimate the cooling effect of aerosols.

A tip: try to use actual data and scientific predictionsn, not a collection of some newsarticles. If you need to rely on these kind predictions you kind of show that you can't refute the actual science.

I don't live in the US so my options of giving US politicians more or less power are quite limited. Although I find it useless to discuss what politicians are saying since the facts don't change because of what they say, I do think that it might also be wise to differentiate between taking comments literally and as a hyperbole. The comment of those 12 years was quite obviously a hyperbole. 

Although politicians often claims that they want clean air and water they often aren't willing to take any actions to realise this. In 2016 the regulations concerning the emissions of toxic gasses like mercury by powerplants where lifted. Actions speak louder than words and some politicians apparently don't care about the emission of toxic gasses. 

You are free to believe what you want. But the evidence for AGW is overwhelming. Your arguments against AGW are simply not true. For volcano's you can check this source: 
Kerrick, D. M. (2001). Present and past nonanthropogenic CO2 degassing from the solid Earth. Reviews of Geophysics, 39(4), 565-585.
Your point about rainforest dying is misused. Over billions of years, the amount of CO2 could get so low life would be impossible. However, this is not a problem right now.

The USGS estimated that during the St Helana eruption around 10 million tons of CO2 were released into the atmosphere. That is a small portion of the 200 million tons of CO2 vulcanos release yearly and negligible compared to the anthropogenic CO2 emissions of more than 35 billion tons.

If all the evidence is coming to the same conclusion and its coming from people and bodies that have no ties to the fossil fuel industry or conservation groups then its obviously true. The only one's denying it are people funded by the fossil fuel lobby and the evidence they've shown so far has been cheery picking or highly deceptive so only a far right ideologue or a believer in a silly conspiracy theory could believe that all of science is wrong and on this one issue the scientific method has got it wrong. Thankfully rational sane people and politicians free from bribery all know climate change to be true. Sadly the US has legalised bribery in its elections and so corporations and the rich elite can try to buy candidates and hence why US policies that benefit the 1% usually get passed despite being overwhelmingly unpopular whilst the opposite is true when its policies supported by the vast majority of the public that isn't supported by the elites rarely gets passed.,UCk6u6IAFhRj2_GPx0ZsTrJw,0.0,UgwwhAdRkI1KKk5ZIlB4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

The main problem for this whole carbon shift is that there's not enough oxygen. Cuz we're killing everything. You only need a oxygen value of 60 to make it dangerous and we're sitting at 55. Carbon is the problem yeah right we're carbon lifeforms carbon is more essential to our survival than oxygen. Everything you see around you is made out of carbon get over it. Carbon plays a small role if you're actually going to look at the reality of it yes carbon can consume some of the oxygen which does play a role but you need to up the levels of oxygen to maintain our health. Ice caps aren't melting because of it either that's because radiation from the Sun the magnetic field is weaker up there and that's what keeps the atmosphere together to deflect radiation from the Sun. Hence that's why the atmosphere is thin up there as well as there used to be a hole that regenerated so so much for your carbon problem. The atmosphere fixed itself I wonder why because that's how the world works it takes care of itself that's why they call it Mother Nature Mother Earth. We need more trees and we need to take care of the oceans. I don't Litter I throw my garbage in the garbage and the carbon that comes out of my vehicle is essential for life in the first place. One tree will give 18 people oxygen plant the trees save your family and at the same time it will consume the carbon. Carbon tax you know it was flawed it was incomplete because it was only a last-ditch effort if and only if all the other Solutions I gave didn't show progress. which I know they will because they're more simple and not too complex and based on our Earth as well as how everything works with our solar system. The Earth is trying to take care of us in its own way this planet was never this cold at the beginning and many other times in its lifespan. Not to mention that the trees will Thrive better without a freezing cold. There will still be Winters because that's when were furthest from the Sun that has nothing to do with global warming. And when I created the carbon tax program not expect it to have anybody try to change it to prove their Theory. Which can't be done mine is Flawless even though there was some things that needed to be figured out. I did hear somebody added some changes but I do not see what changes that has done yet. There was no clarity. But I hope the changes are to what it should be. Anybody get those Phantom headaches here's a little test for you get a bottle of oxygen around 76 value when you get those headaches breathe it in. You'll find something very interesting about it. Also Why do you think polar bears are growing tumours and mutating because it's the radiation from the sun. It's able to punch through that little tiny ozone like no other. Especially don't blame first world countries First World countries cut and then plant their trees responsibly. It's the countries that are throwing their garbage in their oceans all over their freaking land and cutting and burning their Forest without planting new trees like a responsible country. The scientific Community has been telling you guys about the oceans dying and the forest being cut without any regard for life. It's called the chain of life you can't take something out and not put something back. Once the chain is broken all sorts of things start to die. Even the native people have been speaking this. Those countries need to be held accountable for their actions if they're not going to progress properly and be responsible. You don't take things unless you're going to give back. You want to know why cigarettes are so bad for you it's not the carbon that causes a big issue it's all the chemicals that they put in it. Little off topic but still retains to it. I definitely don't suggest breathing in your exhaust from a vehicle or a fire cuz you will die eventually or quickly at high levels. should be more famous than Elon Musk and didn't even get paid. Even made his company viable. You're welcome. And what needed to be fixed about that program. Was a couple things but mainly that it doesn't affect lower class and middle-class people so much as the ones that have the money like the rich. And that doesn't mean jacking up the prices more and more on middle and lower class citizens. Also please people followed the guidelines for covid despite what anybody says if everybody could work together it's going to be a huge benefit for society trust me.

Top soil blows away when there is no vegetation to hold it.  Fortunately crop yields have never been higher and our forests never so plush.   This owing to the fact that the atmosphere's highly depleted CO2 levels are slowly being restored towards health.   

CO2 stops the desertification processes resulting from poor vegetation cover by not only feeding it but also allowing it to thrive on much less water.  Get your facts straight.

Then why did you not link to the actual evidence?  I have been sent on wild-goose chases before.

""It’s important to recognize most evidence of climate change isn’t an experiment, it’s data collection.""

And those data weren't collected from experiments?  The claim is not just that we are going through a warming trend, for which historical temperature data would suffice.  The claim is that human activity is causing it.  This really needs a controlled experiment.

""They look at date that has been collected and essentially interpret it.""

And ultimately, that's just ""trust us.""  I shouldn't have to trust anyone.  The link that you gave me said that the temperature shifts are occurring at rates that we haven't had in decades or thousands of years.  (Mymind raises the question ""which is it?"")  The planet goes back billions.  So, how common is it for temperatures to be stable for a while and then have a sudden shift?  They don't say.  Maybe they don't know.  Maybe they do know and it undermines their case.

The page had a feel of just instructing me what I'm allowed to believe rather than actually making a case for it.  It may be that I'm a bit jaded from having too many people tell me what I'm allowed to believe.

""You want evidence but you don’t want it from the people who actual study it?""

Put the straw down.  The people who ""actually study it"" can certainly present evidence if they have any.  But I won't accept ""we say so and we all agree.""

""I could link you their studies and you could read them for yourself""

I rather doubt it.  But if you actually have the details of one or more physical experiments -- and you aren't linking me to a pay-wall -- I'd love to see it.

""but as you said, you don’t believe them because you say they have an agenda.""

Here's the thing.  If you can produce a physical experiment -- especially one I can reproduce myself -- I don't have to believe them.  This is the type of evidence that I ask for.  Instead, people like you act like evangelical christians, saying that I am closing my eyes to the evidence.

""If a scientist was able to disprove climate change, evolution, gravity, or any other scientific finding in the face of overwhelming evidence they would get a Nobel prize and would have near infinite funding for the rest of their careers.""

Tell that to the early proponents of doctor's washing their hands.  Furthermore, TELLING me there is ""overwhelming evidence"" is not the same as producing any.

1: They would ban or heavily tax nations importing and exporting non essential foods all over the world. Variety is nice - but according tonGates the world will end in 50 to 100 years if we do not reduce green house gases.

2: Budget airlines for the last 30 years.Low paid working class people are flying 3 to 5 times a year - and the wealthy are flying 5 to 10 times a year. Business travellers 10 plus times a year for many non essential trips for an expenses paid jolly - for a meeting that could have been held online. 

3: Powerful 4 litre - 4 wheel drive cars are now the norm. If global warming was real then these cars would be banned full stop / ‘period’ as the Americans say. The green taxes applied do not even prevent a low paid worker having a big flash jeep.Small electric cars would have been subsidised so much we would all have had them. 

4: Instead the Governments around the world had solar panels subsidies and substantial cash back reward schemes for electricity generated. The rewards were good that the rich filled their farm land with thousands of solar panels and drained the so called green subsidy kitty dry within 2 years -  so the schemes were scrapped before the average home owner could install 8 panels on his roof and use some green solar electricity. For 8 panels / 4 kWatts you would  get £2000 cash back every year. So a rich person who had 1000 thousand panels installed on land was receiving £2 million for a 25 year scheme.

It was free money for the rich. There should have been a limit on the amount of panels someone could install based on their electricity usage. They are not even using the green solar electrify being generated every day. It is a lie that it is fed back in to the national grid. What a scam!!

Much of the science is VERY UNCERTAIN, some has been demonstrated to be incorrect and some
was shown to be fraudulent.
It has warmed and cooled in a variable series of short term cycles medium term cycles and long term cycles, for the most part we dont know really what drives some of the cycles.
What is clear it that IT IS NOT Co2.
Human emissions of Co2 are likely to be adding some warming to natural warming cycles but the amount of human contribution is currently uncertain.
Some scientists do indeed have an ideological agenda, the IPCC was specifically created by The Club of Rome  to act as a public relations company for the concept of Anthropogenic Global Warming to promote that concept internationally in a coordinated campaign to justify the predetermined policys that our governments signed us up to at the 1992 Rio Earth Conference.
The previous Club of Rome human Induced Climate Disaster campaign collapsed when we moved from a quite normal short term cooling cycle to the next short term warming cycle.
The next thirty year climate segment (thats how climate is measured) wont end for another eight years so we will have no idea whether the current segment we are in warmed overall, cooled overall or exhibited no overall change till 2029, everything else is just speculation.
However the paleoclimate data has shown us that the current cycles of warming and cooling are slow and mild compared to the shifts in the last eight hundred years alone.
We have had as high and higher warmings several times in the last four thousand years alone.
Sea level dropped by at least a meter only 4500 years ago, and is still slowly rising again, but has yet to reach that level so far.

In other words, IF the sensitivity is high enough to predict a disaster of anything worthy of our spending so much money, it can not track accurately the changes in temperature of the last 100 years.

Climate change is a natural constantly ongoing  earth process its been happening for billions of years and humans do not cause it.
The phrase Climate Change is inappropriate because we are not actually talking about climate, we are really discussing GLOBAL WARMING thats a different thing, climate is so many more weather factors combined.
We know from the climategate e mails that the change from the correct global warming phrase to the incorrect climate change phrase was made for propaganda purposes overall warming having stopped in 1998 (the pause).
Humans are probably adding some warming to the natural warming cycle through our tiny Co2 emissions  (less than 4% of the annual Co2 outgassing), but Co2 has only a limited ability to warm the atmosphere, and its logarithmic so it produces its greatest warming at 20 ppm with every doubling of concentration after that the additional warming is smaller and smaller.
Remember they tried this in the1970s with global cooling, we were then in a normal short term cooling cycle that commenced after the last short term warming cycle that peaked in the late 1930s and ran from 1940 till the late 1970s it was the same propaganda by 2000 ice sheets would cover New York, it was a human induced climate catastrophe unless we took urgent action and transferred global governance to the U.N, they wanted us to sprinkle carbon black on the poles to melt ice and to build as many coal fired power stations as possible to pump as much Co2 into the atmosphere as possible (they were in the process of trying to destroy the nuclear power industry then), then of course we moved into the next short term cycle and as expected it warmed, and study of climate history will show many irregular cycles of warming and cooling.
It all went quiet for a while then it was another human induced climate catastrophe global warming same propaganda but this time heat.
No they were trying to destroy the coal fired power industry, their aim is clear, destroy cheap energy and you destroy the west.
In one of their books (the Club of Rome) they wrote ""giving humans cheap and abundant energy is like giving a child a machine gun"", that is the whole thrust of their intent, Co2 is not their target YOU are their target Co2 is simply the mechanism they have selected to destroy your society, its clear from their writings they want to get rid of 90-95% of humanity, destroy democracy and replace it with a sort of high tech feudal style capitalist socialist dictatorship run by the capitalist elite.
They have no regard for humanity at all and see themselves as a natural elite, they want earths resources for themselves and their descendants, they are supporters of Malthusians and eugenic practices and have no interest in improving life in the developing nations.

NO ONE EVER SAID CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT REAL, that is not and never has been the question, that phrase is a deliberately formulated  propaganda piece to convince the ignorant and gullible that those who point out problems with AGW theory  must not know what they are talking about,  you are correct about politicians but most are on the AGW bandwagon, because they care only about looking popular and most are not interested in science.
If they had a science background and were honest they would NEVER sanction implementing ANY climate legislation, as the science is so UNCERTAIN.
There is a huge difference between the IPCC scientific reports and the advice for policymakers.
I saw ALL this before when the same groups wanted us to melt polar ice and build lots of coal fired power stations to pump as much Co2 as possible into the atmosphere as possible to prevent a human emission caused climate catastrophe.
GLOBAL COOLING that was the 1970's and then we were in a short term cooling cycle that started at the end of the short term warming cycle which peaked in around 1938 (and still holds the record for the most high temperature records broken) in 1940 we moved into the next short term cooling cycle which ran until the 1970's , when we moved into the next short term warming cycle then suddenly it was GLOBAL WARMING instead.
This issue is 90% politics and 10% science, science and scientists are being used to provide justification for the imposition of a predetermined  far reaching geopolitical agenda that our governments signed us up to (without our permission) at the Rio Earth Conference in 1992. 
Both cooling and warming were being pushed by The Club of Rome, who had the IPCC set up (as they did the U.N environmental group) and who are its principle environmental advisors.
The founding member was the Rockefeller family, who donated the land as they had done with the U.N.

Again, the models are validated. More data comes in, the models get better. You're wrong, EVERY climate model includes water vapor, cloud modeling is central to most. But water vapor isn't a forcing, it increases in the air as temperatures increase.

Yes in the past CO2 lagged temperature increases. (By the way, if you acknowledge data like this, then you DON'T get to discount other data about temperature and CO2 that doesn't fit with your prejudices.) Paleoclimatologies (and denialists) think in some cases solar variation increased temperature, leading to increased CO2 which amplified warming. The sun alone can't account for the increased temperature, but the sun plus greenhouse gases increasing does. Today while solar irradiance seems to be slowly declining, we're running an experiment where human activities increased CO2 concentrations _before_ the temperature increase. We see the result, global warming. What do YOU think are the results of that experiment?

Greenhouse effect was proposed earlier than Arrhenius, but Arrhenius's work shows that there should be about an increase in temperature of about 5 degrees C.  Even a simple 2 layer model of the atmosphere shows that the greenhouse effect is not unlimited but has a maximum value. Water vapour is a muchh more powerful greenhouse gas, but nobody wants to model that properly.

To date the only reakl links between CO2 and temperature are that the CO2 level goes up AFTER the temperature does.

The climate models predicted warming, we have seen warming. They're accurate, unlike deniers saying ""It's solar cycles! The temperature will drop in 2011"" (solar output has diminished on its 11-year cycle, yet we keep seeing record temperatures).

Next, why has it warmed? Well, we KNOW increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will warm Earth, it's basic physics. Now maybe all the models (going back to Svante Arrhenius in 1896!) are wrong, and the effect on Earth's temperature of CO2 increasing from 280ppm to 413ppm is negligible, even though we have good prehistoric temperature reconstructions that show strong correlation between higher CO2 levels and warmer temperatures, even though scientists understand the physical processes at work that make the Earth's climate different from the Moon's and use them to build more and more accurate climate models. But then the onus is on deniers to account for the warming. Saying ""It's just natural climate variation, the climate is always changing"" isn't acceptable, that's just handwaving. At that point you're no better than bible thumpers saying ""Only god can affect the climate."" Again, the climate models HAVE made predictions, unlike denialist storytelling.

Next, could natural causes have increased greenhouse gas concentration? Well sure, the existing sources of carbon (primarily organic matter decay) are bigger than humanity's contribution, and they have been exquisite balanced by natural sinks of carbon. But nations do carbon inventories and we know we've burnt about 500 billion tons of carbon (!), and that massive increase in sources accounts for a big chunk of the increase. There haven't been increases in other sources, things like volcanoes are on the order of 100M tons, not billions.",UCQYe2lC-3AZv-h727EpNCSw,1.0,Ugwsot7PHfWeqYRtIIF4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

And instead of spending money and money on renewable energy which is costing a lot of budget, we should be plant trees, planting trees is the easiest way in terms of spending money and another way to spend less money is to have a budget on forrest management and air management. We should be encouraging natural gas, coal and oil to promote jobs and save money. companies should research for emission capture technology to cut methane emission cost.

A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses. 4. Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake. 5.

However Anthropogenic global warming is a hoax. 
Anthropogenic climate change is complete nonsense. 

Carbon dioxide is trace levels in your atmosphere at 400 ppm. 
Furthermore, it only holds heat for a few seconds. Therefore CO2 is not the thermostat that controls our climate on this planet. Carbon dioxide is completely ineffective at driving Climate. 

History even records climate change... we all have seen climate change from 
the three major Ice-ages recorded in history to the subsequent warming 
periods (which were the Medieval warming period in the Roman warming period). 

However, Anthropogenic global warming is a complete hoax. CO2 
has nothing to do with creating global warming. CO2 Is currently 400 ppm. 
That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. 
Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 produced in a year. 

CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible and yet we are told it is true. Lastly, CO2will increase only after temperatures rise and conversely CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack there of and therefore does not drive climate but follow climate.  #CLIMATECHANGE

The relative number of greenhouse gas molecoles is also unimportant for the greenhouse effect.

If NO2 is 100 ppb and it is 200x more powerful 100x 200 is 20,000 ppb or 20 ppm equivalent to CO2   CO2 is 440 ppm is the total of all CO2 which cannot be removed as plants must not be killed.  At most you can claim humans are responsible for 140ppm and more likely 70ppm Thus
20ppm equivelent is 1/22 of all CO2 but 1/7 to 1/3 the as powerful as the human produced portion; not 1/200th.

Next I said that those focused on CO2 have an agenda and it is against the capitalist producers of fossil fuels which is why they push the wrong target CO2. If you are focused on best ROI on human contribution to warming; this is a political agenda; not a logical one; if you are not anti capitalist then you are mislead.

Next , if you didn't follow the story; the existence of huge animals eating grass in the arctic means it was much warmer only 15,000 to 35,000 years ago.  They then
existed for a long time there ; they were caught up in bogs; preserved and eventually frozen over.   We are only now getting warm enough to even melt the permafrost.
This realization prompted me to look at the evidence again; and I saw that it was falsified. CO2 rose but on average temps did not over 20,000 years. Oh and of course I would
think you hear all the time ; this is the warmest ever; clearly not true even during human's short existence.

You did not address why  you go after CO2 first.  
If you were in a large room with pennies , nickels , 20 dollar bills , 100 dollar bills and a few diamonds;  given a short time to remove as much value as you could ; you would go after the pennies first?  This appears illogical to me; I go after the high value targets first. it is much easier to remove 1 pound of SF6 then 25,000 pounds of CO2.

Water vapor is considered a gobal warming gas; it is 2000 ppm rather than 140 of CO2 produced by humans; it is 14x the quantity thus if you removed  all water vapor it would be a very cold place; what is neutral about that?

I did say that liberals want to target CO2 because it fits their political agenda which is they hate capitalist producers of fossil fuel energy  I say so because it is their rhetoric which has given us the wrong target. It is the lowest return on investment of all warming gasses; going after the wrong target means you waste time and money.  CO2 and fossil fuels are declining even if you do nothing about them. Why target them?  Target the best ROI.

Sure you are... But anyway... I am not a liberal... Well I vote for liberal Parties but in Europe... Do you know what that means?  It means that you couldnt have been more wrong about my party affiliations. 

Well anyway:
Water vapour: I explained why water vapour is not relevant. You clearly did not read my comment... One would think you could have spend 3 more seconds on my comment after all you spends the next 5 minutes ranting about liberals... 
Again: water vapour is a passive greenhouse gas. The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is limited by temperatures and any excess will turn into rains before it can significantly increase the temperature by itself. But it can act as a positive feedback...for example for co2.... Co2 first leads to a small temperature increase and than water vapour increases this temperature increase... But the cause of this is still co2 

No2: no the No2 content on the atmosphere is 100 parts pee billion... So 4000 times smallee than CO2... Which means (based on your own 200 times number) that NO2 only contributes 1/200 of NO2..

1164,UgzRvSkBnyaic8wyAPF4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2021-01-05T07:11:59Z,LiteStuff LLC,"​@Dundoril Well sir ; I will suggest it is ignorance that says NO2 isn't significant .. if you take its component of the atmosphere and multiply it by 200x its a large contributor; so is Methane.  Why would you try to tackle CO2 rather than water vapor?  Water vapor is a larger contributor right? Isn't that what you said - the larger contributor should be the one to take on?  why not?  I can tell you why in a moment.  

If I take 1 ton of SF6 out of use ; it is equal to taking 25,000 tons of CO2 out.   If I take 1000 tons of SF6 out ; its like taking out 25 Million tons of CO2. But lets go after CO2 right?
If I take out 1 ton of NO2 its like taking 200 tons of CO2 out.  5000 tones of NO2 is like 1 Million tons of CO2 but lets waste time on the less valuable contributor? right?
if I remove 1 ton of Methane out of the air; it is like taking 86 tons of CO2;  12000 tones of Methane about the same as 1 Million tons of CO2 - but sure CO2 must be attacked first 
Isn't water vapor a bigger contributor than CO2?  There are about 2000 parts per million instead of 440 parts of which at least 300 parts is natural; leaving 140 parts maybe less attributable to man-  to you it is logical to go after C02 first - correct?  Forgive me but I would think any logical non emotional person would go after these more potent gases first.

The actual reason for focusing on CO2 is CO2 producers are powerful , they are capitalistic; they support conservative politicians.  So if you are liberal - you hate them.
Of course you don't have to be a liberal to be educated by a liberals or propagandized by liberals.  I am an independent. I am not impressed by shouting the propaganda enough and people will believe it.  Calling someone stupid or names doesn't help; it makes you appear desperate to avoid review of your own thinking.  Go ahead and explain how you go after C02 first in a logical way .. when theses others are much more valuable or much larger targets.

In the mean time; I'll tell you why I decided it was propaganda. You see; I used to think they were right. Then I read an article saying giant Camels were found in the arctic circle permafrost of Canada.  I recalled lots of huge animals were being discovered in the permafrost in Alaska , Siberia going back 35,000 years.. How did they get in there? What did they eat? How come only now are we starting to find them?  OH if your logical I bet you can think of why... and humans were hunting them, when it was ... ?.

So then I went back to Al Gores inconvenient truth; I looked again at the graphs.  Ooops they didn't plot temperature for the last 20,000 years of human civilization on the 66
Here is my hypocrisy check list; let us see if you are a real believer or just a go along person.  Do you commute in a car pool? If not that is something you can do right away that if done on mass  would reduce traffic by 75% and associated CO2 emissions .. 90% who say they believe in global warming drive alone.  How about drive a very green small high mpg car, or a bike every day; walk? EVs are heavy they are not green; the grid is not green. Yet rich green believers buy EVs and don't share them.  Do you use mass transit? most mass transit is not green; they run near empty 80% of the time. Are you a vegetarian?  That often isnt green; it takes a lot of acres to feed you; and water; which creates water vapor; beyond that it impoverishes the poor in those lands and deprives them of water. Now I agree big feed lots are bad; but animals grazing open fields can be good if well managed so they enhance instead of destroy the land. Of course I'd say focusing on CO2 itself is hypocritical because it isn't the productive target. Do you eat too much? Most westerners are fat.  Lastly, do you agree Al Gore lied;  do  you now see that it was warmer before on earth?  If not you just lie to yourself and you have a quasi religion you believe in that no one can question. Do you think the Amazon is important? Reducing desertification?  Great stop cutting CO2 that is helpful to plants; green houses use up to 5000 parts per million to enhance plant growth. SF6 doesn't help anything except high voltage electrical switching; NO2 is only of value to industrial farming.  Methane burns but other than that it isn't of much value, it is just released into the air, burning it does create CO2 but it is 1/86th the power of Methane as a global warming gas.

So go ahead and attempt to demonstrate logically how CO2 should be the primary global warming gas to be attacked, and try not to be emotional and religious about it.
Then if you admit; AL was a liar; and much of this must be reexamined before focusing on the wrong target.  BTW did you know that if all humans were lined up, we'd be just 4ft  high and 100m wide around the earth ,  The atmosphere is 40+ miles high, the planet 4000 miles deep ; we are near nothing on this planet; our output is trivial. Our structures last hundreds and thousands of years but they mostly reflect away light; it can't be absorbed.  Paint everything white, that would be more effective.

Here is the last little kink in the armor of CO2 based green believers.  NOA says the surface temperature of the earth (land, the standard used for claiming global warming) has not gone up in 20 years.  Not me, NOA.  Do you know why the little ice age happened?  The experts theorize it was a lack of sun spots indicating a 1.5% decline in solar energy combined with high volcanic activity. Those had returned to normal for 4 centuries, and temps rose; but now sun spots have diminished again and just about for the last 20 years. UN models did not predict this at all. So they went out and created new ones to support their agenda.  You know they are liars if they have to change their story to fit the facts.",UCfSUs6Se__IRG9iq8tbp6Dg,1.0,UgzRvSkBnyaic8wyAPF4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

A dog-on-a-bone tendency to think solutions proposed that focus largely on the human contributions vs allowing for new information to increase understanding and decision-making.  We now know that there are major methane pockets under the artic that have a positive cycle should they begin to release that absolutely dwarfs any direct human impacts.  Revisiting solutions/technology that don't require every human to pledge allegiance to inherently limited body's of knowledge, might be a better fight to fight with larger upside than empowering humans to fight over religious beliefs in a point in time, science body.

Your teachers weren't wrong but they didn't expect the discovery of new reserves and the improvements in technology making extraction cheaper causing many reserves previously thought to be unattainable much cheaper.

Considering that most countries now produce 15 to 20% of all their energy needs from renewable sources and it is increasing by the day, I think we would fully transfer to renewable sources before we use up the reserves and countries like China are heavily investing in solar panel tech trying to take over the world while US is still stuck to oil because China is a cut throat authoritarian regime which is not afraid to sacrifice a few corporations or even massacre a few thousand people to ensure future growth while US is haggling with lawyers and laws designed for individual rights, even if those rights are getting in the way of progress.",UCqeqCOoTl4AHGfkfxfmqCmw,1.0,UgxAGz_eVssaBaGHAyp4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

The vastly underappreciated phenomenon of pervection destroys the validity of current doomsday climate change theology

Solar heating of the Earth’s surface causes surface level air to warm, but that warmth is automatically carried to the stratosphere through both convection cooling and by an even more powerful force: pervection cooling.  Imagine our atmosphere filled with a variety of gases, and each molecule of gas as a little ball.  How are you going to stop all those little floating balls from banging into one another and transmitting their kinetic energy up to the stratosphere?  *Without a solid glass or plastic wall surrounding the Earth there can be no greenhouse effect.*  The modest infrared absorptive properties of carbon dioxide and methane only makes pervection cooling and convection cooling work more efficiently, so the net result is nothing.  

Carbon dioxide is a tiny odorless, nontoxic trace gas that makes up just .04% of our atmosphere.  Atmospheric carbon dioxide creates and fuels all life on Earth, and is the true molecular STAFF OF LIFE.  We create, transport, and store all of our food with the absolutely essential help of oil and natural gas.  *No fossil fuels means no food!*

When I look at the global temperature as derived indepently by various different international research groups, they seem to agree very well with each other: http://berkeleyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019_Comparison-768x433.png
So I would really like to see the alternative ""historical temperature data"" that you believe is an honest representation of global temperature since about 1900.

Also note that historical temperature records are by far not the only source we have. Most recently there are satellite measurements, and to go further back into the past, scientists look at tree ring data and sediments in oceans and lakes from all over the world.
I don't dispute that temperature fluctuates a lot from year to year and from place to place, but when scientists reconstruct the (smoothed) global temperature over the last 20000 years (going back to the coldest time of the last glaciation or ""ice age""), this is what they find: https://i.imgur.com/z3T6RTE.jpg


See how quickly global temperature has been rising recently compared to last natural global warming before human civilization even began? It's that speed of recent global warming that worries so many people.

Any warming would mainly affect regions above the 60th parallels.
Sea level rise is the main adverse effect of warming. It is currently rising at 3mm per annum or 3 meters per thousand years.
Arrhenius opined that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations had the beneficial effects of increased agricultural yields and postponing the next glacial maximum. He initially estimated that the climate sensitivity to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was a 5 degree centigrade temperature increase per doubling of concentration. He subsequently revised his estimate down to 2 degrees. 1 degree is likely the real figure due to negative feedback from increased atmospheric convection and increased cloud cover.

Trees growing near the North and South Poles, 50-60 ft more rise in sea levels than today, and global temperatures 3C-4C warmer. At the end of the Permian, 251m years ago, global temperatures rose by six degrees, 95% of species were wiped out. 

You don't need a computer to track CO2 in atmosphere.  A scientific calculator is sufficient to predict CO2 levels using the following formula:  
280 × (1 + e^ (0.0222 × (year-2052))) 
which for the year 2020, it reduces to 280 × (1 + e (0.0222 × (-32))) = 280 × (1 + e -0.7104) = 280 × ( 1 + 0.491447579 ) = 417.605.  
That's consistent with the May 2020 record high of 417 parts per million (ppm) carbon dioxide as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory, which has continually measured CO2 in the atmosphere since 1958. Temperatures will eventually follow exponential rates of atmospheric CO2.  


It’s much harder to predict future global average temperatures except to note that it will eventually increase with anthropogenic increases of CO2.  At some point, temperatures will have a separate exponential curve for a short period when permafrost releases large amounts of methane.  This could happen as soon as 2030.  That’s because warming oceans release pent-up methane from the sea bed, and it’s flammable. Air-methane concentrations as low as 5%,  and a bolt of lightning or some other spark could send fireballs tearing across the sky.   Explosions greater than a nuclear bomb which could destroy life on earth entirely.


You can expect 500ppm of CO2 by 2041 and double that in 2094 A.D.   In Amazonia, forest fires could as much as double by 2050 with warming of approximately 1.5°C to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Changes would be expected to be even more severe in a 4°C world.  Temperature directly correlates to CO2 levels eventually and it will follow the same exponential rate.

These idiots are trying to sell a ridiculous story that global climates can be altered at will by Mankind simply by varying one natural element.

What they dont say because they dont understand applied physics or atmospheric dynamics is that H2O is the element responsible for altering the climates of the Earth, (and there are many). H2O is also massively more abundant because more than 70% of the Planet is water, whereas CO2 forms only 0.04% of the atmosphere. The reason that everything is driven by H2O quite appart from the fact that it is absolutely everywhere, is because the Global Hydrological cycle bears all three states of water at once which enables powerful thermodynamics to come into play during every second of every day, everywhere in the world.

Goodness gracious me, nobody denies that the climate is changing. It is always changing. For most of the present interglacial (the 10,000 years of the Holocene epoch) the climate has been warmer than today. Now it is cooler than 5,000 years ago. It is cooler now than during the Roman optimum or the medieval warm period. That's climate change. It exists. The climate has been warming for the past 200 years. That's a good thing because it was quite cold during the Dalton minimum. Nobody denies that the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is growing, but it is still lower than it has been for most of the last 10,000 years. However, over the last fifty years the level of atmospheric CO2 has shot up at an unusually rapid rate. Almost nobody denies that this is as a result of massive industrialisation over the last century. However, while there has been a rapid increase in CO2 levels, there has not been a corresponding increase in temperature. Over the past 20 years, while CO2 levels have continued to climb, atmospheric temperatures have not, they have levelled. The IPCC predicted that the temperature would increase because of the increased CO2, but this has not occurred. Not only have temperatures not risen in accordance with the IPCC's worst case prediction, they haven't even increased in accordance with their best case prediction. The above document implies it a FACT that there is a link between fossil fuels and temperature increase, but this has not been borne out by the climate record. It is therefore not a fact. The evidence is not supporting the IPCC predictions. In accordance with Newtonian principals, the IPCC should acknowledge their theory is not on the money. They should not remain silent when others ignore the evidence. Albert Einstein once jokingly said: 'When the evidence doesn't support your theory, change the evidence.'  But is the world doing just that? It seems some people are still promoting the theory of CO2-based, man-made climate change, saying it is real, despite the fact that the evidence over the last two decades indicates it is not. I think it would be better to accept the bleeding obvious, that the climate is boss. We don't control the climate.

Wind farms are harmful for birds and take a considerable amount of land
Also there are 55 nulcear power plants in the us which produce 28.7% of the US power grid just a little more than what our renewable sources combined. Despite it taking several years for them to be built the amount of energy it produces cant be ignored. Just by building 150 more poweplants we can get rid of fossil fuels entirely compared to having to build millions of solar panels and miles upon miles of wind farm to even achieve it. Plus solar panels have to be replaced and in some locations have to be cleaned regularly and wind farms having to replace turbines and some have to be taken down completely. There are also places where solar panels can not be used or installed
During the winter for example snow and cloudy/stormy weather make it harder to use
And only works in areas where the sun shines year round
Wind farms however can be our savor though
At the same time the amount of time and resources to build these is too much
Factories takes months to produce 1 turbine
And a weeks to set it up
They can be built in mass to cover our coast lines yet you would need people to go under water for extended periods of time and environmentist would be giving out red flags like destruction of coral reefs and aquatic habitats

I can't promise I will read those papers but I might glance at them tomorrow morning after coffee. The fact is that space weather science right now is subjective. There are 50 papers published everyday relative to the subject and while most tow the mainline UN climate change model there are usually a couple that contradict that narrative.
Short term sun spot activity is relatively low but we are only a year into this solar cycle. Most climatologists that study solar activity predict solar cycle 25 will be about the same strength as the last. However the magnetic field of earth is weakening and the poles have begun their ~12,000 year flip cycle. Weather will be more extreme regardless if humans pollute the atmosphere and with a weak magnetosphere earth's shields are down and the sun could decide to burp on us.",UCj-IUEbkcXREsFZwYWiTQCg,1.0,UgyQ6DyvQMam97yeXJh4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

Politicians give the IPCC billions to ‘prove’ that it is a serious problem. Are you going to believe Al Gore that the sky is falling and the water rising, or your own senses? Storms are not more violent or frequent and the temperatures and sea level rise is so slow as to not be noticeable over a life time- this is in the IPCC reports. Climate science is a captured branch of science, anyone who argues against the religion of catastrophism is vilified, harassed and fired. This is such a big theme lately fake crisis results in huge amounts of control being wielded by bureaucracy. The question is not if the climate changes and if humans effect it. The question is: Is there evidence that demonstrates that the climate will change dramatically thus providing a reasonable and justifiable cause for alarm and large scale mitigating actions? And the answer to that question is: No there is no evidence which provides a reasonable cause for alarm, not now, not in the future. All we have is speculation in the form of computer models. Every single prediction the models have made for two decades is wildly wrong. There are many pushing back against the climate alarmism cult including NASA scientists like Roy Spencer, professional climatologists like Judith Curry, and well known professionals like Greenpeace cofounder Patrick Moore and the weather channel cofounder John Coleman. There are hundreds of scientists who signed a petition removing their names from the falsified document claiming 97% of scientists agreee. There was the climate gate emails trying to hide the decline in global surface temps. The government is paying scientists to lie, and harassing those who don’t go along with the lie. It’s disgusting and it should stop now. I used to believe in Al Gore’s doomsday cult. I did not own a car and biked everywhere. Then I studied all about the climate. There is so much useful information out there. When I tell people now that Climate Alarmism is bogus. They say just go along with it so we can clean up the environment. But when we all start lying then nothing makes any sense anymore. All the billions being wasted on projects that will make no positive difference on the environment and may actually make it worse, plus the negative effect of scaring millions of people, especially vulnerable young people of making them believe the planet is doomed, plus handing over absolute power to politicians will all add up to a horror-show. What will they do in the name of saving the planet? They will stop at nothing, wrecking the environment in the name of saving it. Fossil fuels are the lynchpin of our global economy/ society keep the politician’s hands off it for god’s sake. Not to mention that these geniuses want to ‘correct’ the temperature of the planet by spraying tiny metal particles in the upper atmosphere and other dangerous geo engineering schemes. We allow the government to fund false science to pedal lies. They do this as a excuse to take over and direct economies. They need a way to justify one world banking system and reserve currency. I’m pretty sure they will do whatever they want, like they have been doing all along.

So for now 40+ years Shell knew about its own impact on global warning and did nothing to my knowledge.

Imagine if these same companies had invested all this money from upstructing climate debates, into finding an alternative solution.

In Denmark our parlament has the aim to make our capital CO2 neutral by 2025, they will also ban sales of new combustion motors in 2030 and aims to have reduced CO2 emission for the entire country by 70%, and being 100% carbon neutral by 2050. Currently the goverment is also subsidicing up to 25% for the removal of old gas / oil boilers (central heating installations) for houses, and replaced with air-to-water or water-to-water heating.

Practically every climate model they have made has been wrong. We are sitting on 50 years of wrong climate predictions. Humans might be contributing to the climate, I don't deny that. What I do deny is that we are headed to an absolute apocalypse if we don't shut down the world economy, today. There is a reason climate scientists aren't generally ""climate activists"".

It is predicted that in about 10,000 years there will be another ice age, regardless of ""carbon emissions"", it is due to the Earth's orbit around the sun. The system is dynamic and has been going through cycles since long before humanity. The predictions have almost always been wrong, because they believe it has one underlying cause, and ignores the huge list of things that contribute to the climate. 

My big issue with these statements is people imply that someone who doesn't believe in ""catastrophic climate change"" they are somehow against science, or stupid, or against pollution control and none of that is true! 

Now if someone denied the hole in the Ozone, they would be denying science. CFCs went into the atmosphere and ripped oxygen particles off of ozone molecules, damaging the atmosphere's radiation shielding properties, exposing the Earth to more of the sun's radiation. Precisely explained, clear cut non-societally-destructive solution. 

Climate change ""data"" is vague, poorly explained, and often contradictory. The models are almost always wrong, and they admit they ""correct"" data to fit. That is not at all ""scientific"". The only argument I have ever heard as to why I am not right is ""climate scientists agree"". That is a useless argument. Not every scientist agrees that it is happening, to what level, or what should be done. I can almost guarantee those scientists are still using fossil fuels. 

I don't believe the world is coming to an end. I do believe we should reduce emissions. I don't believe we should just stop fossil fuels. America has done better at reducing emissions than anyone in the world. We produce the same levels today that we did in 1994 despite a population increase of 62 million.

Before the industrial revolution, the sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2 were roughly in balance, meaning that there was no significant change in atmospheric concentration. But adding anthropogenic sources which were not balanced by an increase of the sinks created an imbalance! Thus, there is an accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and an increase over time! THIS is the problem!

Quick example, wrong numbers: let's assume anthropogenic source are only 1% of the total CO2 source (your number), but they are not compensated by an increase of the CO2 sinks (in reality, 50% of these extra emissions are compensated). Let's assume that the sources and sinks don't vary over time. 1% doesn't look like much, but after 100 yrs it would correspond to the total annual emissions of CO2 (natural + anthropo) staying in the atmosphere! In this quick example, it corresponds to ~30% increase of the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere...

What is the cause of climate change and how can it be solved?
Many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.
This is a bit convincing, but not correct.
The exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth.
Therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"".

""GREEN NEW DEAL"" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. 
The biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. 
Therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. 
This is a fundamental problem.
Also, waste is another problem. 
Waste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.

Although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.
Trump should publicize the effects of ""One trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.

Why is ""One trillion trees"" so effective?
First of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. 
forests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.

In addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.
Photosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.
It absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.
One trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. 
The reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide.

How can you get a lot of land? We have to use the desert.
But how to supply a huge amount of water?

To argue that just because CO2 levels varied in the past, mankind has no impact now,  makes no sense though. Here's an analogy: ""The fact that animal populations fluctuated before mankind existed, proves that human hunting never had any impact"". Sounds stupid right? Particularly since mankind has hunted multiple species into (near) extinction.

In other words: what matters is why and how CO2 levels change. Particularly over the past 60 years, there has been a fast rise of CO2 levels, far beyond the bandwidth of the last 1 million+  years. The giant pink elephant(s) in your room for this great anomaly are post-WW2 booming industrialisation, deforestation and another potential factor is live stock.

""Warming may not pollute water supplies, but the stuff that causes warming does.""

Okay, that's nice, but we're discussing Global Warming and climate change, not pollution.

Okay, that's nice, but we're discussing Global Warming and climate change, not pollution.

""And yes, the planet may be getting wetter on average, but this only considers the atmosphere.""

Well yes, the atmosphere, rainfall is increasing, droughts are becoming less expansive and frequent.

 ""Also, the warmer it is, the more water agriculture uses up, according to this study""

Well duh, we've known that for decades now, that's not news, that's high school biology.

But despite that fact, agricultural productivity per acre is up 30% in the last 40 years.

Also, evapotranspiration accounts for 60-70% of all rainfall on Earth, with it being 40% or less in wet areas, and up to 100% in deserts. Meaning when you increase evapotranspiration you increase inland rainfall, especially if you increase other forms of evaporation. This is in large part why the Sahara became vegetated during the Holocene climate optimum, rising temperatures caused increased rainfall along coast and mountain fronts and increased transpiration, which allowed moisture to go further inland.

Seems you didn't even read the abstract, they only concluded that vegetation plays an unresolved role in freshwater availability.

""We conclude that terrestrial vegetation plays a large and unresolved role in shaping future regional freshwater availability, one that will not ubiquitously ameliorate future warming-driven surface drying.""


""Due to climate change, water will become more scarce, affecting the ability of these countries to produce enough food, creating mass famine and drought with drying up rivers.""

No it won't, rainfall is increasing.

The price per bbl is the price for a barrel of oil. The thing that went negative was the Futures price per bbl.  These are not the same.  

Oil is sold in lots and is used as a security for companies to borrow again.

For example, Exxon says ""I have 3 billion barrels of oil proven in such and such a location. I can drill them for $X and I can sell them for $Y at $Z profit. So, Mr Chase Bank, I would like to borrow $1.5 Billion to fund my operation.  You can use the oil in place as collateral for my loan""  (the oil in the ground is basically like a house you borrow money to buy, if you fail to pay the bank gets it).

Mr Chase bank says okay, and Exxon drills.

Now Mr Chase bank doesn't really want to sit around with a paper note in his bank instead of money. So Mr Chase Bank sells the ""FUTURES"" contract of Exxon to Joe Schmoe.  Joe Schmoe gives Mr Chase $1.7 Billion  and Mr Chase gives Joe schmoe the right to be repaid by Exxon over the course of the drilling and production.

What happened is, suddenly supply of oil from saudi and russia went up, the direct market devalued the $/bbl, and so all of the borrowing up above which was based on a predicted $Y price per bbl are now wrong.  Now Exxon can't even get a profit much less a return to Joe Schmoe, so Joe Schmoe's Futures contract is worth NEGATIVE $.

The Price per BBL of oil didn't go negative, the Future's Price per BBL of oil went negative.  This is to say, that the supply exceeded demand SO much that there is no incentive to fund future drilling operations (for a while anyway).  OR you can think of it this way, there was SO much oil on the market, that oil companies were PAYING storage facilities to take it.  Even though the price per bbl is still positive, the value to the company for producing it is negative.",UCeg7eGoBmOvp3h2h6fk6Lyg,1.0,Ugzj5km3Xgmx77HPArV4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

Climate change is real but: 

NASA has data that supports poor farming practices have reduced the planets ability to absorb co2 during the seasons...this means we can't remove the current geeenhouse gases...yes burning fossil fuels are adding greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change BUT if we stop all activities TODAY we still will have too much greenhouse gases....the only feasible way of reducing co2 is to recover farming land into natural forests. The problem nobody wants to deal with is a shortage of food if we do that, we want milk steaks and bread at our convenience......The oil and gas companies are an easy target because 1. They tried to hide their research because they where not 100% sure it was them that is causing this 2 they are successful companies  with a checkered past, so it makes it easy for the media to point the finger, ""it's thoses guys, it's not us"" Our economies require fossil fuels to grow, its the cheapest and most reliable source of power. Without it the quality of ours lives will be worse. 

So make a choice: grow a garden for most foods which will actually reduce greenhouse effect (hard to do in cities however the cities would have to sacrifice real estate for their local needs ), and still have the opportunity to live a better life. OR force the world use renewable energy only with electric cars etc... and still deal with climate change? 

We need to lobby our representatives for a bill that makes the media more accountable for
Their messages, we used to have a law against bias reporting pre 1970s I think, I'd love a CNBC report on that 

Oh and by the way CNBC, Research the dust bowl and tell me poor farming doesn't effect the climate dramatically....

First the Albedo of the Earth is calculated including the clouds and the emissivity is based on the surface. So which is it? Somewhere up in the air or at the surface? If the answer is in the sky then the emissivity is not ""approximately 1.0"", it is lower as clouds have low emissivity compared to the surface.

Secondly most heat leaves Earth from the atmosphere after being transported upwards by convection and evaporation so perhaps that is where the we would find the ""correct"" temperature. For every km up we go the average temperature falls by 6.1 degrees so just above the main clouds the GH effect has dropped by 18 degrees

Add in the effect of lower emissivity and it drops again. It is a certainty that the GH effect is not 34 and it is probable that it is in the bottom third of that range.

So that's two thirds of the GH effect gone just by thinking about the first equation in the theory.

If you doubt this ask a scientist about the above. I actually asked a former IPCC scientist and she just repeated statements like ""Exxon knew"", I asked the questions several times, she just flounced off making insults.

1.  There is a net loss in Coral Reef Ecosystems across the globe. This is due to Coral Bleaching, increased intensity of tornados and hurricanes, and increased sea level(Depth, sunlight, temperature, and stability of coral all contribute to a coral reef's wellbeing) https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coralreef-climate.html  

""No... it doesn't... I'm not sure where you got this idea, Tropical Cyclonic storms of all strengths around the world are stable or on a decline, the same goes for Tornadic activity. In the case of tropical storms, this is likely due to increased wind shear and in the case of Tornadoes, it could likely be due to a decreasing temperature gradient between latitudes."" 

2.  This idea is very common. Global warming leads to increased temperatures which in turn causes more evaporation of the ocean's surface water. More water vapor in the air leads to higher intensity tropical cyclones which, as mentioned before, destroy wildlife habitats and subsequently the ecosystem.

""Not sure where you got this idea from either, droughts are stable or in decline globally as well"" 
3.  Droughts have and are predicted to become more and more intense so long as we do not try to stop the global warming of the Earth. This, again, damages are ecosystems, our crops, and our water supplies.

""With global precipitation increasing"" 
4. Rain...does not spread evenly. And we have increased precipitation BECAUSE of global warming. And that's not necessarily a good thing. Certain places experience and will experience extreme rainfall which will lead to flooding and the eventual destruction of crops(do I need even need to explain why this is bad?). In other words, we will and have began to see more extreme climates which, as I said in my original comment, will disrupt and harm ecosystems around the world.

Forget climate change, the oil industry has already begun it's decline, the economics of oil cannot be sustained in the long term.  Alternatives have already proven to be cheaper and we're just in the early days of this new era. The transition is the business opportunity of the century, just imagine the money to be made from taking the fossil fuel industry's market share. Many investors have already figured this out and bailed on the oil industry. Hundreds of billions are invested in R&D for alternative fuels and energy storage. Even what we have today is good enough, it just needs to be scaled up (i.e. mass produced, cheaper and made widely available) and adopted. Once new innovations come to market, it will solve all the quirks of alternatives. Fossil fuels will soon make no sense simply from an economics standpoint. Climate change deniers within the industry are really only hurting themselves, they have time to plan for this massive market shift but instead they chose to hold on to their crumbling industry. In the end all they will have achieved is to have bought enough time for the big investors and CEOs to strap on their golden parachute, bail on the industry with billions and leave the little guy holding the bag looking like fools.

These science models show a host of things in fact I've seen plenty of ligament data to support that the earth will soon freeze before burning up in heat because with the melting ice in greenland theres a host of large ice melting diluting the salt water currents with freshwater trapped via the melting ice. Which can easily stop the ocean currents which bring warm water up from the equator and with the obvious rise in ocean levels temporarily the major concern is in the fact that without the ocean currents as we know them today bringing up the warm waters we will have a new ice age hit and it could wipe out a large percentage of human life today in doing so.

Eh, it's been relatively linear the past 20 years, rising 3.1 mm per year, and over the past 100 years, sea level has risen on average about 2.1mm per year, though it rose as fast as 3.5mm per year between 1930 and 1950.

It is relatively difficult to say how sea levels will change into the future because this depends on future melt rates, sea surface temperatures, and deep-sea temperatures, so it is best to base the future off current trends as well as the past.

With that said, yes, vast swaths of those two states will be underwater, though in Florida's case 30-60% of this is due to land subsidence and in Louisiana's case 90% of this land loss is due to land subsidence New Orleans, for example, is sinking at a rate of 5 meters per century, compared to sea levels which are currently rising at a rate of 0.35 to 0.3 meters per century, other Gulf Coast cities such as Houston, Galveston, Baton Rouge, Corpus Christi etc. are sinking at similar rates. 

If anything these cities should be focusing 90% of their resources for fighting sea-level rise towards fighting land subsidence and restoring aquifer systems beneath these cities.

In Florida's case, cities like Miami are sinking at about the same rate as sea levels are rising.

Now, Sea level rise is the most severe in Central California, with cities like Sacramento (the house I used to live in was at sea level, the park next to it was three feet below sea level) being one of the most threatened by sea-level rise and rainfall flooding in the world, though again, this is largely because the area is sinking, parts of the central valley are sinking at a staggering rate of 2 inches per MONTH. Meaning again, the primary issue facing these areas with regards to sea level rise isn't rising sea but rather sinking land, and that is where the majority of resources should be directed to.",UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA,1.0,Ugzljb5UEqq8yZ6RQdJ4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

it does say  "" increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels did lag behind increasing temperatures at the end recent ice ages""

secondly again you could have googled it

Earth goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling. It's a result of the milankovitch cycles. The earth axis isn't fixed at 23.5 degrees, it slightly changes from 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.
this causes warming and cooling. 
so as the earth faces the sun it gets warmer, was it faces away it gets cooler.

Co2 is a green house gas. There is absolutely nothing you can say to prove that wrong. 
Excess Co2 has changed the climate in the past and is doing it now. You can check the graphs. In The start the temperature did rise first and Co2 lagged behind, that was because the increasing temperature caused the oceans to release more Co2 (basic solubility). After that Co2 played its part as a green house gas to increase the temperature which then lags behind it. 
Co2 stays in the atmosphere for about 300 -1000 years so thats a lot of time and humans have already emitted 637 billion tons of it, doubling the amount of Co2 in 2 centuries, which normally takes thousands of years.
One more point you're missing is that Co2 rises 50 kilometers up in the sky.
Higher the green house gas, the more potent it is.
The increase of Co2 and the heat captured by it already sets up positive feed back loops like the thawing of the Permafrost and and has already increase in the average temperature of the Earth by 1 degree celsius.
There is extensive proof that this is because of man made emitted green house gases and not by natural processes which I already covered in my previous comment.

Yes, human life is short in comparison to Earth life, so any change that we see is extremely fast for Earth.

Just admit it, you are not climate scientist and you chosen to believe what you want..

""The very idea that humans could damage this earth is laughable.""

Yes, our impact of only 200 years of burning fossil fuels increased STEADY CO2 in air from 275ppm to today 415ppm.
How is that possible?
How we could change composition of air that last 800 000 years was not above 300ppm and now is 415ppm.

The biggest example is quoting total revenue when they are talking about percentage invested in something. Revenue is important to a company - you can't make a profit without it. But you could have annual revenue in the trillions and still make a loss. But of course, it's great to say ""Chevron's revenue was $200 BILLION"". 

Ongoing research, investment in new products etc comes from pre-tax profit - not revenue. Chevron, in 2019, had pretax profit of about $5B on $140B revenue. Now 5 Billion profit is still a lot of money - but it's about 1/30th of their revenue. So an investment which is ""only 0.23% of revenue"" is actually 8% of profit.

Newton's laws, for example, are ""accurate"" if you've got the condition of ""non-relativistic"".  Ohm's law is ""accurate"" for small electric fields but just about any material will have Ohm's law break down at a certain point.

Likewise, ""climate change"" is based on some pretty god damn simple basic thermodynamics.   We're capturing a lot more energy than we used to put out.  The earth isn't exactly efficient at radiating energy.  Also, ya know, I've actually read the IPCC 1990 report.  A 30 year old report.  It's NOT inaccurate.  Seriously, it's disturbingly accurate, especially since we haven't exactly been matching the lower ends of those models.

Yeah, there are disagreements as to exactly the degree of forcings humans contribute.  How fast feedbacks happen.  Etc.  There are always debates at the margins.

But as Isaac Asimov put it in his ""Relativity of Wrong"", ""when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong.

can I ask where are you planing to place all that 5000 panels or more to fill those million BEV? can we know how many woods and wildlife are going to be destroyed in order to place those panels to supply demand?
How many Emissions are going to be released in order to produce all those panles, shipment, transportation, installation?, and list goes up and up.
How many lands are going to be needed in order to place wind turbines just to supply a couple thousand of vehicles?
what happen to city, houses, bussiness, industrial (which draw more energy right now) how many emissions are needed in order to manufacture steel for those turbines? and again list goes up and up. 

other would say is less expensive to use renewable energy and is the future, well not really, solar cost are around $0.06 per KW maybe some places less or more but, you still had to pay electric services and other state taxes, which increase electric bill to sky usually realistic electric energy tariff goes around to $0.22cents per KWh, Meanwhile Gasoline on KWh measure cost around $0.08 cents directly to gas tank of course vehicles are not efficient on they use so economic impact is clear.

My thought is not possible with just renewable energies supply EV possible demand, Fuels are always going to be needed to supply demand, and continue to be the most unexpensive way of energy right now, 
but Also i know ICE vehicles are not really efficient so would be more simple and easy to make ICE vehicles more efficient with fuel consumption with now technologies coming this would reduce ICE vehicles emissions by 70% or maybe more that would stop climate change by far, without releasing more emission on lithium batteries and other expensive and hard process components needed for those EVs. and without braking peoples bank account.

The energy it takes to make a wind turbine is repaid in the first few years of operation, and then for the next two decades it's almost free energy. That's why wind and solar are the majority of new generation they're cheap and quick.

Good news: no scientist is claiming that we'll all die in 10 years or 40 years. We're a resourceful species and there are nearly 8 billion of us! Even when tens of millions of people become climate refugees and say a fifth of them die, that's comparatively a drop in the bucket. _However_, every additional ton of CO2 we put in the atmosphere will over the next CENTURIES increase the warming of the Earth, adding to the ongoing warming from the 500 billion or so tons we've already added. So every year we don't reduce greenhouse gas emissions makes the likely warming by 2100 worse. Hence the accepted projection that if we don't reduce fossil fuel emissions dramatically over the next few decades, we are committed to 2° C or more warming by 2100 (and even more warming in the centuries thereafter), and the cumulative effects of that much warming will be catastrophic overall. Does that help you understand the timetable?

The Earth had been slowly warming since the last glaciation some 18,000 years ago, and in the distant past the climate has regularly cooled to ice age conditions. In the 1970s a few climatologists, certainly not majority, thought there were signs that the switch to ""a new ice age"" was within centuries, and they got a lot of press. However, since then the fossil fuels we've burned have completely overwhelmed any possible cooling trend, and instead caused about 0.9° C of warming! We've delayed the onset of the next ice age by 100,000 years or more, and if temperatures continue to rise at 0.15°C per decade,  large regions of the Earth will instead be uninhabitable within centuries.

Plastic pollution is a largely separate problem from the harms resulting from global warming caused primarily by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuel. The volume of plastic pollution that's getting into the oceans is millions of tons; the amount of CO2 were pumping into the atmosphere is billions of tons. If you're serious and not trying to change the subject, we can reduce plastic in the oceans dramatically by 1) forcing fishermen not to dump their mles of nets, and 2) making countries, mostly in Asia, process their garbage instead of letting it drift out to sea.",UCQYe2lC-3AZv-h727EpNCSw,1.0,UgxCnnGzvvzjHHsdvLB4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

     In an online lesson* on Acceleration, the graphs showing Distance vs. Time can be applied to “sea level rise” of oceanography. But also Speed vs. Distance is another acceleration form. Two forms, but most people only think there’s one kind of acceleration.
     Climate alarmists confuse two things: velocity speed vs distance speed (over same period of time). 
These two graphs show the difference*
     Sea levels always ebb and flow between ice ages, when the polar regions increase or decrease in size. But the way to know if it’s natural or manmade is seeing if the sea level graphs go from straight and steady, to curved and increasing... Do they?
The NOAA sea level graphs are all straight and steady all over the world for the last 150 years. Half that time (recent most industrial 75 years) should show an upward-curving (not still straight) graph, as fossil fuels emitted more CO2 — if the Earth couldn’t absorb it naturally.
     But, as NOAA’s own graphs show, they do not increase in sea level speed (height distance over time). Alarmists wrongly interpret steady acceleration graphs since 150 years ago, but think it’s increasing speed in sea level height. It’s not, because the sea level graphs are straight, even in places where sea levels are falling (e.g.: Sweden https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=050-141 ). 
     Therefore, we can conclude the Earth is absorbing CO2 and there’s no “melting” global ice (it may evaporate from sublimation** instead). The CO2 greenhouse theory from 100 years ago was refuted soon after by another scientist. H2O vapor in the atmosphere totally cancels out greenhouse effects of CO2 and methane emissions overwhelmingly. 

* FAQ: “but why is street flooding worse along beaches and rivers?”
A: local and regional water management planning and local sinking ground from subsidence ***
* FAQ: “but why do I see global temperatures rising and it’s so hot in Australia in December?”
A: actual thermometer records show it was hotter many times before now, when CO2 levels and fossil fuel use was lower; plus the alarmists altered the historic records in their fake science research and press releases. The seasons are opposite in southern vs. northern hemisphere.

People could carpool in mass; cutting traffic and energy use for commutes by 75% , they mostly drive alone.  They eat too much, impacting themselves and all others.  They speed; taking higher risk and reducing mileage; they even target the wrong gas to try to reduce warming, and increase the wrong ones.  If you remove one pound of SF6 you've taken out the equivalent of 25,000 lbs of CO2; instead this gas needed to expand the electrical grid is being increased.  One pound of NO2 is equal to 200 lbs of CO2.  One pound of Methane is worth 86 pounds of C02. Instead they get diverted into an anti capitalistic passion against fossil fuel producers; rather than focus on the most effective means of reducing temperature.  And this all presumes they even should be worried about this over other issues.  Yes those capitalists know something; they know they can sell all they want because people are not going to reduce their energy consumption on their own, and other sources will not force them to reduce output because demand is rising; and their reserves are dwindling.

Here's a picture of Gordon MacDonald showing us how high the ocean would be by 2030 (https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/42192/did-climate-scientists-in-the-1980s-predict-a-1-meter-sea-level-rise-by-now) and we're well on our way to that being true.
We as a species have allowed and encouraged *corporations* to use industrial technology to pollute the globe.  And every breathing one of us exhales tonnes of carbon dioxide, and the plants we depend on for food and oxygen in turn depend on carbon dioxide *which is not a ""pollutant.""*
How do we responsibly answer the threat of CO2 levels? First, we establish that is IS a threat. Sherwood Idso's research (https://res.cloudinary.com/highereducation/image/upload/w_740,h_541,c_scale,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1/TheBestSchools.org/Figure-16) suggests it is not. Additionally, CO2 concentrations aboard US submarines (which stay submerged for six months at a time) *average* 4000ppm, and get as high as 8000ppm; ten to twenty times the current concentrations. Plants respond better to increased CO2. If you've never seen it, just fly over the Netherlands at night and notice the swaths of greenhouses that flood the winter sky with light. In addition to light, *they keep the CO2 levels extremely high* so the tulips can be bloomed in time to be harvested and transported to New York in time for the first day of spring. (You can also search ""Netherlands greenhouses night"" and find images.)
We might also track the levels of the oceans to see if there's an effect there. NOAA data from 375 long-term trend tide stations is publicly available, and their changes have been linear. Have a look at one I happen to have in hand: NOAA 8628660, 960-065, PSMSL 399 at Portsmouth, Virginia (http://sealevel.info/MSL_graph.php?id=8638660). The net change across that station has been *linear* for most of a century since it started; about 3mm per year. The thickness of 24 sheets of paper in your printer.
Now look at Neah Bay, Washington (http://sealevel.info/MSL_graph.php?id=9443090) It has also moved about 150mm in 50 years, but it went *down.*
Or look at Port Angeles, Washington, where it has risen less than one millimeter in 40 years.
Keep clicking that blue triangle to flip through other stations; that green line in all of them is CO2. Note the sea level vector is wholly unaffected by CO2 rise.
If sea levels have been rising for at least 40 years, why doesn't Venice already have two stories underwater?  Have they been jacking it up every year to keep pace?  Why isn't DisneyWorld a port on the Florida coast?  Remember, tides change as the earth spins under the gravitational influences of the moon and sun. In the Bay of Fundy (Canada,) the difference is 50 feet between high tide and low tide, and it has nothing to do with ""global warming,"" but it makes for a nice tourist attraction.  http://bayoffundytourism.com/worlds-highest-tides/
Facts are important, and here's one:  ""Where there is a trough, there will be pigs.""  (Alex Pushkin)  Teachers who want tenure have to toe the line.  It has become - at the very least - politically expedient to say one believes in global warming...
oops, I mean ""climate change.""  Change is endemic with a complex atmosphere/biosphere like that of Earth.  I've put 110K km on my Nissan Leaf all-electric car over the past decade because if we burn up all our petrochemicals, what are we going to get the plastics out of which our world is made?  And as a bonus, it puts a *hard stop* on my dependence upon religious lunatics' sweet crude.

It is based on actual facts, or just a bunch of cherry-picked data points?   Is it logically sound, with each step well established as a reliable cause-and-effect?
I'm one of the biggest proponents of accelerating change.  (Example: We used to only be able to send messages as fast as feet.  Then we thought to send them at the speed of horses' feet.  Then at the speed of a motorised carriage, and finally at the speed of jets.)  And suddenly...email.  
Change of the climate, specifically the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, only happens so fast.  The amount of it our industrial tech adds is a tiny fraction (between 1 and 2%, I think) of the total output of every carbon-dioxide-exhaling critter on the planet (this includes you.)
It has been fantastically higher in the past.  It makes plants grow better and helps green our world.  The idea of a runaway carbon dioxide level doesn't obtain because...chemistry.  Rising carbon dioxide levels don't make the growth *rate* increase any more than pressing the accelerator of your car will take you to light speed if you don't keep from pressing the pedal too hard.  If that worked, chemistry would be very different.

An exponential function just as often indicates increasing rates of decline as well as growth.   Thus the more money taxpayers toss at government teacher unions the more stupid our kids become - its an ""exponential"" function.

Fires need fuel.  We used to clear cut California's trees by cutting fire breaks and underbrush, particularly near developments.   I'm an old California emigrant before I made good my escape.  I know quite a bit about this.

With rare exception (coastal moisture soaked redwood forests in Northern California) fir trees have only one of two deaths:   Either by being logged or by burning in fires either naturally or by idiots with matches.    Trees and brush do not fare well in climates that are desert like for 9 months out of a year.

Increased CO2 levels aid the growth of and health of all vegetation found in semi-arid deserts.   The reason this occurs is that they are both fed and kept soil watered by CO2.   Plants lose about 100 water molecules for every CO2 molecule they ingest through their stomata.  These stomata diminish in size when CO2 molecules are plentiful, they open as CO2 levels diminish and in so doing lose more precious moisture, just as you do they lose needed moisture through their gaping  mouths gulping for their food.

You thus have it ass-backwards.  Increased CO2 levels protect semi-arid vegetation from fire.  Just for fun and extra credit which gas is commonly used in fire extinguishers?

Regarding solar storms, a volume of emitting IR photons will only equally emit in all directions when the surrounding air parcel is the same temperature. 

This is confirmed by the NASA Saber instrument. NO and CO2 protect against solar storms in the thermosphere, and 95% of the absorbed radiation gets near instantly radiated back to the colder space.

CO2 doesn't trap heat a quantum mechanics impossibility. CO2 intercepts a very specific spectrum of EM radiation (light) and re-radiates that energy usually in all directions in the lower atmosphere or as a cloned photon.

1)  There is no provable connection between atmospheric/oceanic co2 levels and climate, in fact the only proof that exists indicates quite the opposite.  Your 'problem' is make-believe and therefore the only thing we need to do is ignore this collectivist science fiction published solely for self-enrichment of the few at the expense of humanity.

2) There is however, abundant proof that atmospheric co2 levels of today are extremely beneficial for all plant life, both natural and artificially grown, both on land and in the seas.  This benefits not only humans, but all animal life forms, both on land and in the seas.  Therefore, we do not 'need' to plant trees. Forests grew long before humans arrived, therefore they do not need us to show them how to grow.  As with all plant life, they prosper on a diet of co2, water, trace minerals and sunlight   Therefore, more co2 yields more plants and healthier plants.  This in turn means more animals,healthier animals (including humans).  Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, it is the base of the tree of life for all life on Earth.  This is the source of the carbon for all carbon based life on Earth.   
 
3) Co2 levels at twice, triple, or quadruple today's levels both have been and are provably absolutely beneficial for all life on Earth resulting in the reduction or elimination of the harmful desertification processes both on land and in the oceans.

All of these preceding enumerated statements are supported by abundant evidence from the geological record and the historical record, as well as with repeatable and verifiable controlled experimentation.   Therefore, they are scientifically correct regardless of all of the massive efforts to propagandize the young and the foolish, including yourself, with pseudo-scientific falsehoods into relinquishing their birthright to political charlatans and would-be tyrants.",UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA,1.0,UgyNvdXFQM8nR1vOTHd4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

As I’ve stated ad nauseam, the US and EU are on track and doing their parts; however, no one else is. That makes the whole effort pointless.

It’s pointless for us to do anything when other countries have no intention of following through. If trends have continued into 2021, even if Europe and the US stopped emitting completely, that wouldn’t even reduce emissions by a fifth.

""It turns out that while much of the “pulse” of extra CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere would be absorbed over the next century if emissions miraculously were to end today, about 20 percent of that CO2 would remain for at least tens of thousands of years."" - Yale's Climate Connections

""Each of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All of these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world, regardless of the source of the emissions."" - epa.gov

Skeptical Science's relevant video showing the carbon cycle: https://youtu.be/8R4YavfQ7jk

Again, you're wrong. Not kind of wrong. Not a little wrong. Factually wrong. Your original claim is factually incorrect and extremely misinformed.

As for your second assertion, that China misreports their annual emissions: For your claim to be relevant they would have to be misreporting their emissions by a factor of ~2. You know we have satellites in orbit that can track carbon dioxide emissions, right? NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 exists and publishes its data freely.

So on the one side we have you pulling asinine speculation out of your backside, and on the other we have hard data and science.

You have it twisted, my compatriot. If you can't be bothered to educate yourself even a little when talking to someone who clearly knows more than you do about a subject, you're wasting *their* time. I'm about done giving you a free education over here.

(EDIT: I forgot to mention you just avoided the point you didn't like. They're emitting less per capita. They're a much larger nation. It is only sensible they will emit more than we do. Just as we emit more than Mexico or Britain. This should go without saying, but it seems like you may have forgotten the concept. Instead you deflected with an aspersion that I don't understand geopolitics. 

It is a completely meaningless red herring to speculate that they lie in this context, unless they lie enough to hide four times our carbon emissions. You have no proof of that level of deception, therefore the claim can be discarded.

So wrong on the first point in your rebuttal. The second point you made is inconsequential. You think it's clever, though, so let's address it:

If China lived exactly on par with the lifestyle of Americans today they'd emit over four times the CO2 we do! Imagine that. That would be equal. Parity. Imagine that. A fair argument considering more factors than just who has the highest number per nation this year!

Meaning, that the scientific community and their projections are overlooked or undermined, merely due to the fact that the majority is suffering from a lack of awareness and or cannot picture a goal-oriented and conscious form of societal interaction over climate change. Competition is conductive to progress, competition is great. there is political competition, economical competition, social competition, sports and athletics, etc.. 

However, climate change requires a unified response and a way to manage the upcoming changes in our natural environment, and this is now actually a need, which we must meet because it is a functional imperative...

I don't think the people working there are villains. They provided a service for society. But we now know that service came at a higher cost than we were aware, and that some companies fought tooth and nail to hide and then obfuscate that cost.

Doesn't make them evil, but it *should* be remembered. The members of the board who made that choice should be ostracized from polite society, if you ask me. Maybe sued into the dirt. They delayed the inevitable transition from fossil fuels for, potentially, decades.

Fossil fuel companies should be *grateful,* they get subsidies, they get to lobby congress, they get to sell their petroleum products without worrying about any of the *systemic cost* that they will cause. The damage to the environment is not factored in. Their profits are at the future tax payer's expense.

That and companies like ExxonMobil *knew* about anthropogenic global warming in the 70's and *buried* it. There is *literally nothing* to be *grateful* towards those companies for. They provided a service, we paid for it, and they reaped *massive* profits.

A quick glance at the graph is all that's required to see the lack of correlation, it's a major reason we graph data. 

You said: ""Why do you think rising sea levels will be welcomed by the persons there and why are you seemingly talking as if the melting of glaciers will only affect ppl within a certain distance there?""  What gave you the impression I think rising sea levels will be welcomed?  What gives you the impression I think melting glaciers only affects within a certain distance?

What makes you think 2°C will materially affect ice at either pole when current temperatures at both poles are presently far more than 2° below freezing?  Arctic ice is floating, if it melts the sea level will drop.  Only ice that is on land causes sea level to rise.

I wonder if you were born 12,000 years ago, would you be opposed to glaciers melting?  I hope not because where I live the ice at that time was 2 miles thick!  

It's not my bar chart, and I don't completely subscribe to the 1° for every doubling of CO2 because it's a chaotic system and there are a lot of factors and even things CO2 affects may result in cooling instead of heating, however, if we use the 1° concept, from 400 ppm to 800 ppm is 1°, from 800 ppm to 1600 ppm is another 1°, and from 1600 to 3200 is another 1°; 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.  I don't see us getting to 1600 ppm, and humans have trouble breathing at 3200 ppm, so I doubt we would want to get there even if it were possible.",UC-IR_w0BsspgvdeeGVxLAbw,1.0,UgwDmk8Tuh5-loGGVzt4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis
3209,UgwDmk8Tuh5-loGGVzt4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2020-12-30T14:13:33Z,Chavez Harding,"@Ron_the_Skeptic In science we don't look at graphs and just say whether or not there is correlation. There is a way to test for that. An example being the regression model. Your links are working now so thanks for the effort. The graph you used in your other link ""Whats up with that"" shows that there is significant correlation actually (the first and second ln curves). Next to the equation you'll see that the R^2=0.997. That indicates significant correlation between the 2 variables. If R^2 were closer to 0 then there would be no significant correlation.

As far as the graphs go the first 2 are quite accurate. However, while ot may look like they will flatline they most certainly will not. Yes at this rate we will reach 1600ppm CO2 although that may take a long while since there is a net increase of CO2 in the atm. The only way that will slow is if we intentionally curb our CO2 emissions or if we run out of resources producing CO2. Everytime you double the previous [CO2] the temp may go up by approx. 1°C. Thats no flatline a flatline indicates that there is no gradient meaning there will be no change in temp. That's not what is happening. 

Why do you think rising sea levels will be welcomed by the persons there and why are you seemingly talking as if the melting of glaciers will only affect ppl within a certain distance there? This affects everyone; a large amount of us, negatively.

If global temperatures are raised some places will be far more affected than others. For instance land will be far more affected than the sea. According to NASA the arctic is the most sensitive to change in temperature. 

https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/

The bar chart is something I'll have to ponder on if I am to be completely honest. The whats up with that website you linked got one thing wrong. The IPCC never used a linear relationship to predict temp change. 

If you could link the derivation of that bar chart that would be fantastic. It show cases that the temp contribution of CO2 to the atm approaches 3°C but will never exceed 3°C which is strange to me.",UCzPgO10Z72cbhCjIOrCNcdQ,1.0,UgwDmk8Tuh5-loGGVzt4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

There are many hypothesis regarding CO2 and warming, and Arrhenius was overly optimistic about how much warming his grandchildren might expect; he considered the warming good.  I observe over the last century or so, the ""experts"" have repeatedly alternately warned of both warming and cooling.
The activists' claim has been stated as ""CO2 is the thermostat"", it has also been stated as ""we only have X years to take action before we reach a tipping point"" -- where 'X' has already expired several times without any apparent consequence.  It may be that as CO2 doubles, temperature increases by 1°, which would lead to the graph something like the one for which the link didn't work.  The page is still there, so lets try the link again, ...  https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/03/08/the-logarithmic-effect-of-carbon-dioxide/

So my point remains, as more CO2 goes into the atmosphere, temperature is affected less and less, and we are already past the steep part of the curve and onto the flatter part.  I seriously doubt we could put enough CO2 into the atmosphere to get to 1600 ppm, so the worst case would be doubling twice or 2 degrees.  As I pointed out last night, 2 degrees won't really affect Antarctica at all and the effect in the Arctic might be welcomed by those who live there.  Also, 2° is completely lost in the noise when looking at the rest of temperature fluctuation.  The graph I linked last night clearly shows temperature does not correlate with CO2 levels, so there are much larger forces than CO2 at work.  There is clearly no tipping point regarding CO2.  The NASA claim that plants are taking back ground that is more arid seems reasonable and for anyone who is truly ""green"" that should be the good news.  

There may be some valid reason  to promote ""green energy"", but I don't believe it is actually ""green"" and I still don't believe curtailing CO2 emissions is the correct path because whether we do it now, or we allow CO2 levels to erode, at some point we are going to have to pump more CO2 into the air to save life on the planet.",UC-IR_w0BsspgvdeeGVxLAbw,1.0,UgwDmk8Tuh5-loGGVzt4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

1. Our ""low"" life expectancy has nothing to do with the quality of our Healthcare. That's due to our poor lifestyles, in which we eat twice the average intake of sugar as the average human, and 50% more food than a human should be eating, and partly due to our infant mortality, but more on that in a second. Our survival rates are the highest in the world, followed by Canada and the Netherlands.

2. Our high infant mortality rate has both something and nothing to do with our healthcare.

So first off, we have one of the highest rates of premature pregnancies in the developed world, which means naturally we will have more infant and maternal deaths during the birthing process and after it, because the more immature a girl is when giving birth the chances of her and her child dying increases exponentially.

The second issue really says more about how good our system (or lack thereof I suppose) is.  We have the highest standards in the world, and doctors will try to save an infant regardless of its weight and how premature it is, and if they fail to save it they count it as an infant death.

No other country on Earth does this, every other country has a weight limit, and say that if an infant is below this weight it isn't considered alive, so no attempt to save it can or will be made, and the death of the infant isn't counted.

In Russia this is about 1,000 grams, in most western country it's about 700-1000 grams, In Canada, which Is by far among the better countries when it comes to this, puts the weight at 550 grams.

My friend for example, if he had been born anywhere outside of Canada or the U.S., would've been left to die, as he had been far too underweight to be considered ""alive"" in other countries.

And the more premature a baby is, the chances of it dying increases exponentially.

This is why you should be looking at the survival rate as a function of the infants weight, and in that case America is among the highest if not the highest survival rates in the world.

1)If you did want freedom above all else then you'd not be in favor of capitalism.
Under capitalism the workplace, the place where people spend the bulk of their productive adult life, is a place where they have no say.  

Under capitalism one's life choices are usually a set of select few pre-determined options that are usually dictated by the economic status they were born in.

Under capitalism you have entire demographics that are ground to dust for some extra wealth.

There is no freedom, only multiple choices of the same product made by the same corporation.

A market socialist system or a decentralized post monetary system would solve this and increase freedom.
I wonder if you think the 70+ cases where the people of a nation decided to democratically abandon capitlaism and were violently ""regime changed"" back into capitaism is freedom to you.?



And no, free market capitalism is a myth. A convenient lie of an impossible ideal meant so sucker people into supporting ridiculous economic policy.
Capitalism implodes without someone enforcing it.

2)You are speaking to an agricultural engineer. 
capitalism is close to the maximum waste we could get, the amount of perfectly good produce that's wasted because it would fetch a slightly lower price or to artificially retain scarcity and inflate prices is inexcusable.

Other examples of meaningless waste are planned obsolesence, retention of outdated and less efficient technology for cost cutting, no recycling of rare earth minerals, overproduction and subsiquens waste of clothing that's made to break down fast, etc.

3)That's an absolutely silly sentence that can't even pass as an argument.
By your logic it wasn't feudalism's problem, the surfs just had to stop eating food that's made on the land of their lords.

You are saying ""it's not the system's problem, humans just have to stop participating in society and act in a completely different way than how humans act and the problem will be solved.""

As if purchase choices make a difference when your purchase goes to the same pockets.

Not tomention that this comment fails Econ 101 by ignoring inelastic demand and purchasing power, you know things that make some consumption choices impossible to not do.

This is no excuse to your favor, you just pointed out that capitalism is incoompatible with how society works.

Once again, if you want the people to be able to cause change in production to be more sustainable then you should be in favor of them owning the workplace, in other words you'd want to maximize freedom.

Because, as pointed out in 1, capitalism is not a free system. The workers have no say.

But I guess you are fine with tyranny so long as it's not ""the state"" enforcing it.

5) It literally is a systemic system
Capitalism mathematically crashes when supply meets demand (mathematical limit of prices hits 0), when you have no unemployment (mathematical limit of wages hits infinite), when you eliminate poverty (mathematical limit of the value of money is 0), etc.

Capitalism is an ancient, steam age system.
A product of a time that was barely out of feudalism, a time where math was 1/1000th of what we have now.


7)
Take a look at my comment again, I am basing it on raw logistics. Raw poroduction, productive capacity, technological ability to extract resoruces, etc.
This is why I said ""a living standard comperable to that of a millionaire"" and not all would be millionaires.
You are using capitlaism and it's bad logistics as a metric to judge a system that would operate with different logistic distribution.

almost all our goods are either overproduced or artificially scarce.
with poroper allocation they'd all be abundant and we'd still have more spare labor power to increase R&D, infrastructure and services.


We are using steam age logistics to manage a digital age.

Bro, freedom should go above all else, capitalism, at least free market capitalism, isn't a system, it's a lack thereof.

And if anything it maximizes resource use, because wasted resource cost money and productivity, which hurts those that are held financially accountable.

The problem isn't that it's a free market, the problem is that society cares more about their ten I-phones than the environment.

Then factor in, what also should have also been addressed here, the ""scientific"" studies that are pushed with flawed or intentionally doctored data. It was a somewhat big deal back in 2008-09 when it came out there were a lot of climate change researchers forging data in order to keep money flowing into their facilities; because no one is going to continue funding something that's not proving their argument.
So now americans are faced with corrupt scientists on top of the already corrupt politicians. So the people who already didn't believe are vindicated and will never be convinced, and the ones who were on the fence don't buy in anymore either.

We are evolved for global warming, not the current conditions. So far we have experienced increased crop yields, increase in rainfall, decreased droughts, decrease in hurricanes hitting landfall, and the severity of hurricanes hitting landfall to such a great degree that current models no longer work, increased inhabitable land, increase in exploitable land for rare earths, increase in plant foliage by at least 25%..to name a few things

The best weather models show that rainfall has increased and will continue to increase as the Earth gets warmer. South Africa recorded its 2nd highest yield ever in 2018 - the report says it was 'due to abundant rainfall during the critical pollination and grain-filling stages from January 21through the end of April' One the back of the 4th highest ever yield the prior year. 'South Africa has seen a 35% increase in yield in the last 10 years.' Due to rainfall. Australia is currently having its best season in 200 years. With even far-left media reporting 'Fuelled by above-average rainfall between March and August, winter crop production in the state is predicted to rise 49% above the 10-year average to 2019-20. It means Australia’s overall production will increase by 60% year on year, raising hopes that the industry will drive the country’s post-pandemic economic recovery.' In Australia, droughts have decreased by 100%, while rainfall has significantly increased. This is true in the entire planet and it's true by margins unheard of in human history and it's all due to rain.

Briffa's paper was on tree ring density and width in the norther hemisphere. In the 60's the THERMOMOTERS and every other global temperature proxy show temperatures rising. The ""leaked"" emails show a conversation between to scientists discussing the discrepancy.  Contrary to what this video wants you to believe, this is and never was a big dark secret. No data has been deleted, hidden or altered. Its all public information available to all.  Multiple investigations by multiple organizations in multiple countries had open investigations concerning the  ""leak"". No one was found to have done anything illegal, unethical, or even unscientific. Besides Braffa who died in 2016 and a few who are retired, they are all still conducting research and active in the scientific community. 

20 years later, the divergence phenomena between tree ring data in the norther hemisphere and AQCTAUL rising temperatures is still be studies. You will find countless studies, many by Briffa, I suggest you read them. 

As to your original comment of why climate change denial still exists. The link you sent to the CDN is why. They put together nicely made videos that look professional to convince your average science illiterates. This isn't a science channel. This is a FF funded propaganda organization. The two people involved have no science background. One has a PHD in history, the other is an executive in the mining/FF industry. 

It's possible to not understand or or want to believe in anthropogenic climate change and still acknowledge that FF have an undeniable negative impact on the environment and the living organisms in it. I find it odd that not one of their videos dare to mention any of these negative impacts.

I sent you the link earlier, it explains all the issues around the ""climategate"" and everyone who was involved.

You didn't take any note of the points i made and keep fighting the straw man. - But that's the issue with ideologues - if something contradicts their world view,  no matter how much evidence one presents, it is not enough. 
By the way, I am not trying to convince you that climate change is not real.

Taxes are also lower than in the US for lower incomes. There isnt income tax, for instance.

As for minimum wages, I dont know what math youre doing there, nor there are 2000 work hours in a year. In Portugal minimum wage is 665€ a month and there are 252 business days in a year and 22 days of legally mandated vacation. That leaves 230 days to work, resulting in 1840 hours. Now, minimum wage is paid in 14 months per year, 12 calendar months plus 2 times of double pay for vacation and Christmas, 665x14=9310€/year. Divide by the hours and you have 5.06€/hour, $6.16/hour. You can live very comfortably on this wage alone or as a couple. 150€/month for food, 200€ for mortgage, 30€ for internet/cable, 50€ for electricity and water and 120€ for transportation and 73€ in tax and you have a bit left. These are very doable numbers Im giving here, not much effort needed.

Unemployment is paid by the social security fund, which is financed by payroll taxes. The employer pays the equivalent of 24% of the employees wage while the employee pays 11% of its wage.

In reality people get 80% of their wage from their last job for 2 years, then they drop to minimum wage if they are still unemployed.

The incentive to work is to make more money, thats obvious. It doesnt need to be work or starve for people to have an incentive to work... not sure whats the problem you have with socialism. Im in a country currently ruled by the ""Socialist party"". As you can imagine people here dont have a problem with socialism

As for the renewables, the market is letting them rise to dominance, thats why I mentioned the situation in the US, where with little incentive renewables are rising and extremely profitable.

Your general picture doesnt excuse one to not do anything just because others are also faltering. If Portugal is 200% green it can make say Morocco 100% green by selling them that extra electricity. Another problem with the US seems to be that the power grids arent interconnected...

How is nuclear a solution for anything when its more expensive in every step than wind or solar?

How can a country magically pay everyone a minimum wage regardless of whether they work or not. Where does the money come from? Tax the ultra rich until there are none left, then who pays? What is the incentive to work if the government provides everyone enough to live on with no work requirement.
If renewables are cheaper as it seems is happening, then economics should let them dominate. I think nuclear storage is not a safe storage problem but the fact that people just don't want them stored near where they live. Here in US where they were going to be stored inside a mountain, away from civilization, we still couldn't get it done. I have heard a number of experts say nuclear is a vital component to the transition.
The underlying question remains. Unless the whole world acts decisively now, it seems individual efforts will not make a difference and it seems, to me, that is not going to happen.

Also, nuclear is not anywhere close to 100% clean, where would you have gathered that? There is no permanent solution for the radioactive waste and over the long term is pretty much impossible to prevent leaks and contamination from happening. As for homelessness I honestly dont understand that one. Any developed dountry will pay people in unemployment at least an equivalent to the minimum wage. Theres no reason for people to be homeless just because they dont have a job. When it comes to jobs, if a government is directing investment based on number of jobs created and not economic multiplication then its defrauding taxpayers. As I said, thats a weird socialist consideration very peculiar to the americans.

Here in Portugal more than half of the electricity used comes from renewables and during the Spring and Summer there are stretches of weeks where only renewables are used, the maximum was 2 months on renewahles only. The last coal plant closed last week and prices have been decreasing for at least 3 years. Big datacenters (which are big taxpayers) from companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Netflix have been built here instead of other countries as they can claim to use 100% net green energy without having to pay much for it. Myself, I use 100% green electricity in my home as its one of the cheapest rates on the market. Maybe Im mistaken but probably a problem in the US is that there isnt a free market for electricity where people can choose the provider they want.

I do not understand why climate activists are so anti-nuclear as it is 100% clean. If renewables can deliver cheaper power then the market would phase them out over time. 
How can you have a discussion without including the effect on jobs or how much it will cost? If a clean new environment means vast job loss throughout the world what is the point. A clean world with massive unemployment and homelessness? 
A 100 billion euro investment is very, very little and over 5 years. Why are they talking about $30T over 10 years in the US, something that since Sanders lost, no one is talking about anymore and even Biden's commitments are far less and even that seems unlikely.

In Europe the way different plants contract to provide energy to the grid is very complicated and those nuclear plants were asking for too much money to keep going. Germany decided to use existing coal plants in the short term while they build up more renewable capacity. As for that idea of creating jobs thats a very american thing where, somehow, jobs are taken into consideration over sustainability or efficiency. No one else is talking about jobs as a reason to move to green energy, thats missing the point.

China seems to be on track to meet their target, though sure, they could be doing a lot more and Russia is clearly not doing anything even if, looking at the data, their increase in emissions will be offset by the decrease in the EU.

As for an economic bonanza, I already gave you the example of EDP who pioneered in building green energy and went from a small regional player to the 4th biggest renewables producer in the world, the most profitable per dollar invested and having last week closed their last coal plant. The European Union as a whole is set to invest 100B€ in hydrogen storage alone over the next 5 years.

The US, first of all would not need to spend trillions, second it will actually spend way more in lost trade. US automakers have already been shut out of developed countries and as the bar increases consumers themselves avoid purchasing products from the US, known for poor regulation and low quality products.

At the same time, foreign companies dominate the US renewables market, a very profitable one. EDP, a Portuguese company, is the US's biggest wind developed and producer. Their revenue in 2019 from the US alone was close to $1B, with $600M in profit.

This “keeping up with the Jones’s” way of life in America is what will bite us in the ass one day. 

In Cuba, they had an embargo since the 1950’s that banned importing American made vehicles, and they didn’t have a vehicle manufacturer in Cuba of their own so they were stuck with the classic cars from that era. To this DAY, these vehicles are still littering the streets of Havana, because the people who NEEDED the car actually took care of it, worked on it, and cherished it. Meanwhile here in the United States, an average family will go through 10-20 cars throughout their lifetime because they NEED more cup holders and seats with an ass warmer in it... see what I’m getting at ?

The evidence and conclusions must be falsifiable. Anyone can, with their own set of evidence, present an equally falsifiable alternative or refutation. In time theories are accepted by how closely they reflect the material world, not any persons ideas. Imagine an airplane. Wrapped up in an airplane design is a whole lot of theories. As soon as that plane gets moving and flies as predicted we can tell ourselves we actually know something. The plane does not fly because theorist x,y and z claimed it would. It flies because what we think we understand actually reflects the physical world. The plane actually working is the proof. The same goes for the device you are using to view youtube. Your daily life is surrounded by products that are the result of the empirical method (science). You do not question the theories behind those things. But climate science you have decided must be wrong? Why? You clearly have no reason to since you do not understand the methodology itself nor the actual research. Science is only a method for knowing. It is nothing else. Again, it cannot, on its own tell us what we should do with knowledge or even if we should acquire certain pieces of knowledge. It can however be used to inform our ethics. The empirical method is at it's core humble. Conclusions cannot be insisted they are true without evidence external to the person doing the concluding and those conclusions can be demonstrated wrong using the same method. The method clearly works if you consider the vast increase in knowledge of the world humans have developed in only a relatively short period of time which we use to exploit that physical world to our advantage. That being said, our use of this knowledge is not without consequences as we are interacting with other natural systems.

We have large continuous forests and fire is a part of that, always has been. Two summers ago we had major fires in parts of the state where there are usually none or not large scale. We also have types of vegetation moving into locations previously impossible for it to grow, animals, insects and arachnids moving north into the region, a 3 week longer growing season, coastal erosion from increased storm intensity forcing entire villages to relocate, later freeze up and earlier thaw of rivers and lakes, rapidly melting permafrost increasing costs for building and infrastructure maintenance. News from my state tends to not be broadcast elsewhere. If you want a picture of the possible long term future for more temperate latitudes the extreme north is a good place to look.
If you think that your opinion based solely on the reasoning ability of the human brain has as much merit as the conclusions derived via the empirical method i suggest you need to do some learning about the evolution of the brain. By inventing a more complex, less probable and absent of evidence explanation that involves conspiracy you are not being skeptical, you are being cynical. Do not fool yourself to believe otherwise. Scientists are humans too and can confound ethics with their empirically derived conclusions. In other words the scientific method repeatedly indicates anthropogenic climate change is a thing. Ethics arguments then offer prescriptions for what we should do with that knowledge. That could include nothing. Again i suggest you should let the science work itself out since you do not have the tools to do the research nor are you immersed in the history or complexity of that research. Instead focus on the ethical arguments.  For example, If climate change and these likely impacts, then we should/ should not do these things in response. Then argue why.

Predictive success is part of how well models/ theories are considered to be reflective of reality. If a model/ theory has problems with predictive success it does not necessarily mean the whole thing gets thrown out. It is revised so that falsifiability increases but moves towards better predictive capability. Any model from the 1890's would have been very poor for lack of data. If you mean 1980's it still would have had limited data compared to now. In many cases the predictions have actually been surpassed by reality.

and again your missing my point am not blaming china am not saying we dont have to make changes. am arguing the green new deal proposal thats it. the way they want to accomplish this is not going to work with the technology we have in batteries for vehicles and transportation. 
now am not saying the US shouldn't do nothing. am talking about the impact and the push back that US will get from trying to implement something this drastic. and have you ever worked in an oil rig i have its not fun and it has alot more people than what people realize. there is so much that is happening that people that dont work in the oil business in the grounds dont think about. now this video talked about the oil business and it clearly stated that oil is still booming and the US is the world leader in producing oil.
Again am not holding any country more accountable. am not saying change shouldn't happen. but technology needs to be able to keep up with demand and the skilled personnel to be able to do the new jobs that would have to be created is not there, people hardly know how to use there cellphone. the change with the green new deal. will push to fast and doesnt have enough technology backing to make it work. 

explain to me as a economics how the automotive industry alone would be able to make enough cars for everyone to buy in ten years (which is what the green new deal wants to do is zero emissions by 2030) and produce enough energy to run every single car on the road with out using any fossil fuel... with out getting into every other industry just the automotive industry...",UCdZUanKox9Kajj0ioM87VKQ,1.0,UgxBZ_Au4mOk8pAxgGt4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

i have almost a fully automated home and in my area i wont go solar because the companies that sell solar energy equipment rob people more than actually help the environment the amount of fossil fuels they use to make every panel cable and equipment,
is greater than what good one home does going solar. so me having a automated home and having LED lights to not waste energy makes more of a impact, and paying my local energy companies than going solar. 

China alone makes so much more pollution by capita as you keep repeating.

let me clarify on what i meant on one of the lowest polluting countries, am talking about the countries that actually have an impact on the world economy. like china, India, Russia, the Middle East ect. the US has more regulations than any countries. this why we are able to change Presidents or congress leaders when we see no change or we see something wrong. other countries have Presidents or leaders that make all the decisions and no one is able to make any changes without losing everything or even there lifes. i have been lucky enough to be able to travel the world and see all this. and i urge you to travel the world and see what really happens around the world. nature is protected in the US and around the world its not, and is why you see bill gates and other organizations travel around the world to make change and try and put infrastructure in place so people stop abusing the planet. and that is why i said the world needs to change together to accomplish change in global warming. am not Democrat or republican but when pushed i almost always side with democrats on mist ideas, except the green new deal.

now the green new deal does not make new jobs or new housing. it forces companies to change the way they do business and put in equipment and other ways to have zero emissions. now think about that, tell me that the billionaires in US and around the world will actually do and put things in place and keep everyone on the payroll. look at whats happening now companies where forced to shutdown and most of them laid-off workers to let the government pay them instead of them being good humans and paying salaries for a few months while things reopened or got a chance to be able to put safety protocols to be able to run there business during the pandemic. 
the world billionaires have alot of money in US economy if they will not be able to use fossil fuels to make money in the US  they will take there money out of the US economy and invest it other places where they will keep making money doing the same thing, loosing more jobs.
then there is the transportation aspect of the green new deal, how is the US going to deliver all the goods we ship, battery technology good enough yet, where they can be used to deliver everything we send just in ground freight. right now it would take a semi about 2 hours to be able to recharge fully to be only to travel about 500 miles on one charge. most trucks drive 800-1000miles (some more but there not supposed too) a day with almost no stops now think about how may semi trucks are on the road. that alone would collapse so fast and so many businesses would close down because they cant get products fast enough they need to do there jobs or sell to consumers. my problem with the green new deal, is that it puts changes in places for the wealthy to do something about it and they will not make changes and keep everyone on the payroll if it affects they're pockets they will make changes that affect most of the US population. while politicians put laws like this in place they still get taxpayer checks and keep living the glamorous life they already do... now i know not every politician is this way but most of them are. so if you think of all this why would we want this in place.",UCdZUanKox9Kajj0ioM87VKQ,1.0,UgxBZ_Au4mOk8pAxgGt4AaABAg,f1rxv1yPQrc,2020-12-20T17:00:30Z,climate crisis

Thats exactly the point I was trying to make.. There is no REAL scientific data that in ANY way shows that the world will end in 12 years.  I do remember when I was in high school reading the ""scholastic journal"" and them saying 20 years ago that the world was doomed and that the seas would rise 200 feet in the next 10 years.  That there would be massive flooding and famine.  If we did not act NOW, to stop global warming..  Yeah.. that was 20 years ago.  Sea levels have risen less than 2 inches since then.  By looking at coastal flood plain archeology  we can see that sea levels have  risen and fallen 30+ feet in the last couple thousand years.  So sea floor levels rising and falling is nothing new.  Given the fact that the average sea level is rising by a couple milimeters a year currently, thats pretty neglegable in the grand scheme of things.  In my opinion there are much bigger fish to fry, and problems that we could actually do something about, besides the ""green new deal"".

“The record-setting snowfall in New England this month — seven feet and counting in Massachusetts — poses dangerous risks through snow-covered roofs, ice dams and gutter floods.”

Fluffy, fresh snow can weigh as little as three pounds per square foot compared with 21 pounds for wet, heavy snow, according to FEMA. Ice weighs more: 57 pounds a square foot. Considering the average-size roof in the United States is in the range of 2,000 square feet, the weight of snow and ice can add up to dangerous sums.

The Boston Globe: “It’s a good idea to remove snow that's 18 inches or more on low-pitch roofs.”

Also in 1970, NASA's S.I. Rasool explained, over the next five to 10 years, there would be ""such a temperature decrease [that it] could be sufficient to trigger an ice age.”

At this time, in the 70s, the media and elected officials were placing fear into mankind about a new ice age.

Of course, not a one can predict next week’s global weather in total accuracy, but they know what will occur 10 years from today.

Jesus Christ is our only hope—Romans 10:9-10 from the Bible: “That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”",UC_t2gDPxWLbPgtlSDz2rnjw,0.0,UgznqVjUUcxROpVchMB4AaABAg,2-JJhjIoBKI,2019-08-13T12:28:49Z,climate change greta

The catch is, since the field is relatively immature, even the creators of that very data rather disagree on what it means and avoid claiming that what they found is the ultimate truth and a key to a better world.

Wanting pick a part her successes with a comment about her lifestyle of having parents that are successful.  What about trump and his billions?  You pick him a part,too?  We are STILL waiting on his tax returns.  The only people that need to hide something like that is a liar or someone that is corrupt.  
Yes you cannot control 7 billion people but you can start with getting world leaders to take steps toward keeping our main resource habitable (earth) and we have to try.  Yeah it earth will bounce back after the humans have a mass die off or extinct.  As for Greta,  and let’s get the numbers straight 97% agree and the paid off 3% disagree that humans are a factor in climate change for the last 30years and leaders were taking steps (small not good enough steps).   Finally someone that could reach the future, our kids, made a stand.  Yes she has a platform from having well off parents but she is using her resources to get her point across.  Let’s talk about that 3% of scientists that say the data is not all in.  Don’t know how old you are but remember, doctors from big tobacco (I think in the ‘70s) said that smoking does not cause lung cancer, or the NFL doctors saying concussions do not cause brain damage (CTE).  
For the billions of dollars at stake, you realize fossil fuel companies get $20  billion in subsidies every year.  The budget for the military is $989 billion the Afghan war was $2.4 trillion and majority of our military focus in on the Middle East.  Each year the beef and dairy industries $39 billion.  
The blame is not divided on one party or another like the news or each party wants you to believe.  They are all corrupt as Greta talked to all leaders.  I used to work for a lobbyist at his personal house.  He had photos of himself golfing with George Bush senior, a picture golfing with George Bush junior, and a picture golfing with  Bill Clinton.  The lobbyists want to corrupt what ever sides are going to make the decisions.  Greta’s message is stop funding such a horrible cycle and look at the big picture.  Her message is to get out of cars and use public transport, plant a tree, and just to be conscious of your actions.  No big winners here.  The leaders can put regulations on certain things, can give subsidies to the gas and big beef for better practices.  There is a way to catch methane from cows and can use it to power equipment.  Instead Trump takes away regulations from the biggest polluters and defunds the EPA .
Yes you cannot control 7 billion people but you can give them the option of making better less expensive choices.  Take away the subsidies and only give them subsidies for creating a better cleaner environment.  Closing our borders to external oil and gas, stop fighting wars that will never be won, and subsidize education to what is new and advanced to create a better stronger country.",UCi4i6J1fnOBwF8VS2Z2vpOg,1.0,UgyKCO4G4nfVeB5rUmp4AaABAg,2-JJhjIoBKI,2019-08-13T12:28:49Z,climate change greta

It was a revolution in the neighborhood.  Lets sow flowers. Its so easy, just throw the corn onto the ground. To get the insects back.They thrive on those plants,  I m watching hungry desperate birds every day. Lets feed them.Insects , bees and wasps are desperate, I can see them hovering around the garbage containers. thats a sure sign that something is wrong. Give them some of their honey back.  Dont let the mayor tell you its wrong. What Thunberg does is also for a good cause, but we can start a revolution ourselves. If we really want to. Dont vacuum clean your lawn , (like I have seen recently) let nature visit your garden. Dont dust off every leaf. Let nature take its course. Its ok to demonstrate against mindless and greedy politicians. Companies who ruin nature must be punished, boycott them. But start in your home to reverse the demise.Dont waste things. Dont use the car to get cigarettes around the corner. Dont throw cigarette butts into the sewer. Dont throw your plastic bottles and other into the the bushes. Dont throw out any food. It can be managed. You ll even save money. Dont let anyone fell any trees in
your cities. Dont throw your old furniture into the park or the forests. Stop eating so much meat.
you ll feel better when you eat simple things, like noodles, spaghetti, potato dishes. You wont starve
by eating less meat. Dont fly to some European island (if you are European), for a few days for 35 Euros for a ticket. It's madness. if you dont care, you ll perish.",UCQhRJG7pgvyMUAacmctDIAA,0.0,Ugwzv5kprQ3wxY6QJwx4AaABAg,2-JJhjIoBKI,2019-08-13T12:28:49Z,climate change greta

Or you could fly to a place where she is going to be.  I hear she usually walks.  Now for my advice, it sounds like you should contact a mental health professional to help you through this rough time you're going through.  There are also crisis lines that you can call for free to talk to someone and learn about other resources.  Here's an international directory:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  Also, I remember Greta saying that she felt very depressed about the situation of global climate change, but then she realized she could do something about it.

When it is cold, Co2 vaporises. A good example of this is when a plane is flying high in a clear blue sky; we will then see a great cloud of vaporised Co2. Where clouds don't rise, but in low pressure areas they can come down as rain or snow, but they don't rise up into the stratosphere. 
Even the lightest of all bird feathers is heavier than air. And no matter wherever the wind may blow it, it will still land somewhere on the earth, or on rivers or the sea, but doesn’t go up into the stratosphere. 
Although methane, from cows, from humans and Co gas, are potential greenhouse gases, their effect is relatively short-lived. So perhaps the climate change and the global warming that spelled the end of the recognised Ice-Age, over 12,000 years ago, is also what is happening now? 
For the Sun radiates carbon among its other gases! Therefore it is more likely than not that the greenhouse effect is the carbon which is radiated from the sun! When it is waste plastic that should surely be our true concern? 
But to hit the nail firmly on the head, run your car engine on a cold morning, and then look at the end of your exhaust to see where the vaporised Co2 actually goes.

If you just tell me that the world is going to end in in twelve years then the conversation is over. Just 25 miles north of Paradise California  where the Camp Fire burned down my house is a huge tract of land owned by Georgia Pacific with stands of huge Fir trees. What is immediately noticed is a lack of understory and other flashy fuels that were largely responsible for the rapid spread of the wildfire in the surrounding geographic territory and logging roads that act as natural firebreaks. Outside of this privately held tract it “was” almost impossible to pass through because of the thick understory (I say was deliberately).
