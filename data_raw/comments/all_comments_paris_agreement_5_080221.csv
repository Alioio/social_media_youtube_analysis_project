The idea of man-made CO2 the sole cause of Global Warming is absurd and scientifically baseless.
 There are so many factors which influence the changing of climate.
The Sun and Water vapor are 2 of the biggest factors. Only 2% of gas in the atmosphere is Greenhouse gasses.
Out of that 2%, only 4% is Co2, and 1% Methane, the rest (95%) is Water vapor from the ocean.
 If you do the math, Co2 only account for 0.04% of the total atmosphere.

Climate Agreement is based on the agreed principles of common but ""differentiated responsibilities"" which puts the onus of climate action on rich countries in terms of taking initiative.

We get an insane amount of benefits for out taxes. Which is why we're so high on the EF index. Now I get being against a high tax IF! One has very low trust in goverment, for example in countries with high corruption. But when the goverment actually put the tax money to work.. It's golden. Which helps everybody. And everybody being taken care off, while the system does its best to provide equal oppertunity = is the result of a high tax. But its worth it. And we can compare the nordic countries with who ever you prefer. The results of the high tax will speak for itself in many if not most of the cases.

 But then again I have to play the devils advocate here. Yes companies should not be bailed out, but if there is regulation on for example the bank industry, they cant make the shitty decisions that for example lead to the crash in 2008. Which lead to PROPER regulation in form of the Frank-Dodd act, by Obama. Trump then made the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that exempted dozens U.S. banks. But like you, Im not getting off topic :P

""The greatest crimes issue from a desire for excess and not from necessity"" - Aristotle. I said ""OVERLY insane hunger for profit"" which seems to be the norm in sooo many companies. To be clear having profit as a motive is fine! But that excessive greed.. It destroys, ultimately.  And you're right, I do think about the worker. People work to live, they dont live to work (at least most people) and voluntarily can be confused for in desperate need of.. Now since I sense you have a strong fundamental in economic, I assume you know that unions is not really all that in for example America? I mean f*cking amazon doesnt have a union. So yes, they SHOULD , and that's another area where regulation should be enforced. Force them to have unions, and why dont they ""Overly insane hunger for profits"" > Lobbyism.

Well it seems that in terms of macro economics and in terms of liberalism (btw you do get bonus point for throwing Adam Smith in there :P ) But on the terms of the paris accord - we'll agree to disagree.

The ""excessive taxation"" thing was just my opinion, in fact I said as much. And when I talked about the Nordic countries being closer to free markets I meant less regulations over all, I believe they are at the top of the Economic Freedom Index.
For the market to work, companies have to fail and we should let them fail, obviously. If we don't, society's limited resources are used less effectively and to causes consumers desire less, that is a recipe for disaster.
I won't get into banks because it's pretty long, but just so you know, banks should fail and they will always fail. The practice of loaning deposits inherently creates cycles of boom and bust, that is basically what every bank does today. Today we have fractional reserve banks, I believe we should have full reserve banks, they don't create money out of thin air to loan out. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I suggest you look into the Austrian Business Cycle and how banks and governments increase the money supply.
Going back to what we were talking about, I just think states should stay out of it. I think the market comes up with better solutions, not only to the climate problem, but to pretty much everything.
I don't think the ""overly insane hunger for profit"" is a bad thing, in fact the profit motive (or how Adam Smith called it ""the desire for betterment"") is essential to human action and the market. It is what makes it work. I know most people when they call it ""excessive"" they are concerned for workers, I suppose that's at least part of what you mean. If the contract between an employer and his employee is voluntary, as it is and should always be, the employee doesn't need to accept it, he can look for a higher paying job. Also, the role of unions is essential to pushing wages up until their actual market value, the problem is today they try to push it higher through government action. Going back to competition, employers also compete between themselves to get employees, which pushes salaries up.

To sum up, I don't think we'll agree, we just have different world views. I don't like the state, I think most of their policies, although they may have good intentions, have bad results. We should agree to disagree, I guess :D

I just happen to be from one of the Nordic countries (Denmark) and I can tell you that you are again - wrong. We do not have ""excessive taxation of the middle class"", we have excessive taxation of the upper class while the middle and lower have the same. Which is by far the better system. The only thing lagging there, is letting companies pay less while workers pay more (But that's a whole other issue on its own) And the fact that you have SOME insight, while missing the bigger picture, is the same with the climate accord. You're missing the bigger picture, and you're wrong. And if you're not getting your information from right winged American news, then I don't get why you're not understanding this correctly.

But at least we see eye to eye on letting failing companies fall. In Denmark we have a saying: ""Let what falls fall if it cant stand tall"". But I'm guessing we're disagreeing on not getting to that point, for the industries due to goverment regulations? Limiting banks in making stupid decisions etc

 There is no free market in the United States, neither on practically any country in the world today. There are just ""freer"" markets depending on industry and country. You could count Sweden and the Nordic countries as free market because of their high levels of economic freedom, although they have excessive taxation of the middle class, in my opinion.
A real free market requires little or no regulation, only to protect individual's rights from externalities, and no government intervention. Now tell me, where do you see no government intervention?

The paris climate accord is to GLOBALLY avoid rising to a 2*. (Not only THOSE countries but globally) That could only happen WITH the CURRENT top pollutors joining in on this issue. Being China, India and Pakistan. 

And actually YES, they HAVE done something. China has redirected $367 billion from their coal industry to renewable energy. While you've got the tangerine tyrant in America reversing almost 100 enviromental laws.

Then you do the same as the video, you take NOT very specific information, and twist it, so it sounds good coming from you. The United states (The BIGGEST pollutor in HISTORY, not current, but still biggest) is on the list of 18 countries that are reducing their carbon emissions and where on that list do you think they are? Top 3? Top 5? Top 10? Or further down.. Mmm ;)

Then you're just plain wrong. By your third point Im almost certain you're american, repeating something you've heard on fox. ""Only the free market can..."" Jesus christ..  Yes look how the free market is doing wonders in America... -.- 

So let me get something right here: Obama gets america into the the Paris climate accord. He literally thrusts America into it. Trump then gets THAT america, and you wanna acknowledge him for doing good things for America? Im sorry, but if you want nuclear power - CHINA has to be involved. Who started a trade war, which funny enough destroyed Bill Gates plan for making top of the line facilities... WHILE he dismantled all the enviromental protection laws (Water pollution, carbon emissions, drilling, pesticides etc!)

It is clearly you gets your ""news"" from the wrong sources. Im just gonna take a guess here: Right winged american? Some OAN and FOX on the television? Because you definetly sound like one.

Even if that was the case it didn't succeed in doing that, if no one enforces it and they can decide their goals, they won't do anything. And they haven't done anything.

2. The US pollutes far less than China today and, in fact, America is one of the fastest countries in reducing carbon emissions. This reduction is not thanks to any government regulation or subsidy, it is because of natural gas, fracking and nuclear power. You may not like them, but they produce by far more energy and more efficiently than wind and solar (actually solar energy panels have to be replaced every 5 years and pollute more because of this). With time, maybe solar or wind energy could become more efficient, but the fact remains that if the government subsidizes them, they won't develop as fast (If you give money to a company to solve a problem, when the problem is solved they won't get payed anymore. If the problem is never solved, they will always receive guaranteed money for not solving the problem).

3. Only the free market can reduce carbon emissions. This has been proved time and time again over the past decade. New technologies and improvements in nuclear power have made this form of energy the safest, cleanest and most efficient. Only rich countries can reduce their emissions (check the environmental Kuznets' Curve).

4. During the Trump administration, out of the Paris Climate Agreement, America was reducing their carbon emissions much faster than before under Obama because of what I've said before: deregulation and letting the energy market of fracking and nuclear power develop. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no fan of Trump, but when he does something good we have to acknowledge it.

We all know that the rich mans government will never do anything beyond lining its own goddamned pockets at the expense of all but their own 
Governments do not give two shits about the welfare of mankind and one quick look around provides the undisputed scientific proof of this. 
The elite and corporate carbon shit stain is far darker than the rest of planets people‚Äôs and the rest of the planets people‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for it anymore.
Mankind has become so goddamned addicted denials and delusions the whole of civilization has abandoned all reality, common sense, and hindsight.
Only a complete fool would ever trust the powers of government today. 
This planet will never be saved by the powers of corrupt greedy criminal governments and their corporate counterparts.
That is the real pollutant killing mankind.",0.0,0.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

The majority of things Trump has done are negative for the environment. The world is not fair, big child needs to accept that. Instead of pulling away, how about talk first?

Stossel, you glorify Trump's actions in a bright light too much. 

Could you talk about Trump firing many well respected people in the government for petty reasons? I know you're republican and in favor of Trump but destroy him a bit too as he has divided the nation by not thinking before speaking, caring too much about the economy than people (which consequently caused a drop in the economy), and the fact that Trump is pulling out of agreements that he should have never.

The point of the agreement was to try and get the entire world the agree on the basic idea that climate change is a threat and that nations need to start working on solutions. By getting such widespread adoption, it succeeded in that goal. By exiting the agreement, the US is not actually changing any policies, as the agreement was not binding, it is simply signaling a rejection of the basic idea that climate change is a threat and that nations need to start working on solutions.

Also, while the US can not solve the climate crisis alone, as it does not release all of the world's greenhouse gasses, it does have an opportunity to lead the way. Eventually, the world will adopt green technologies. If the US pushes to develop these technologies now in their domestic markets, American companies can become global leaders in these industries, as opposed to falling behind foreign rivals. It will cost money to implement green technology, but the costs will have to be incurred eventually; we will save money by taking action sooner rather than later.

I'm guessing that the study was referring to the effect of particulates on warming.  Soot, sulphur dioxide, are often emitted with greenhouse gases, but they block out sunlight and reduce warming.  Water vapor clouds actually have a warming effect.

Also, when people say ""x percentage of scientists agree"", it's a fraught subject.  I think that if most experts agree on one thing it is significant, but what matters much more is what the literature says.  There is a consensus within climate literature as to the mechanism behind climate change.
As for what's ""to blame"" for the warming, that's a pretty easy one to answer.
1. We know CO2 is a greenhouse gas (absorbs IR radiation, very easy to test on your own)
2. We have many methods to measure past environmental conditions like temperature and gas concentration. This lets us determine the speed and magnitude of modern change.
3. Greenhouse gases are a vital component of climate stability.  Without them, Earth can't retain energy, and we'd be an iceball; nitrogen and oxygen do not have a greenhouse effect.  Too much of them, and we'd end up like Venus.
4. We can tell WHERE this new influx of carbon has come from.  Geological carbon is not exposed to radiation, and lacks carbon isotopes -13 and -14.  The ratio of carbon isotopes in the air has decreased in conjunction with the use of fossil fuels, while geological activity has not changed enough to be the culprit.

Have you read the report on why some experts believe 2020 was heating up? Their claim is interesting because it shows evidence that lack of carbon emmisions may have caused higher temperatures because less clouds = less sunlight deflected and it resulted in more heat.

I'm not sure where to place my belief with what is to blame because free thinking ideas are shunned if they go against the norm, which is ridiculous because science isn't supposed to be based off a percentage of those that agree.

...I planned to link the study but I'm having trouble finding it now that it's missing from my news feed...

This green new deal is designed around replacing coal factories which produce CO¬≤ and water vapor emissions and carbon emissions from gasoline and diesel vehicles being the problem.

Average person I America cannot afford an electric vehicle which currently is ch a red overnight, when solar panels are not generating power. The solution could be argued that we just need more batteries. How long are these storage devices going to be sustainable before they need replacing? Help me find that figure because we know they aren't going to last forever.

How many batteries do we need for storage, how fast and cheap can they be produced? How much materials are left on Earth for storage of this energy.

It's not a question of would green energy work its a question of 'WHO' is seeking to profit the most from that market.

Tesla has publicly stated their overarching goal is to replace 'EVERY' oil burning vehicle with an autonomous electric vehicle. These will be owned by Tesla and used by everyone at a cost. They have also began to invest interest in the energy market where each Tesla will store energy collected that is too much for the grid to handle (i.e. California currently forced to pay other states to take excess solar energy or their grid will be destroyed) then sell it back at peak pricing to consumers.

This is no different than the buying of aquifers in Africa by Nestl√© then selling it back to the local village as bottles...

Since John is a faithful supporter of Trump, it's of course not surprising that he provides a shallow, false view of the Paris Agreement.

Measuring the positive impacts of the Paris Agreement is too complex for this channel. It is by now a central document for international climate governance, and is integrated in many multilateral processes. It is true that the initial pledges were not at all in line with the temperature goals - but those pledges were just that, initial. What John did not include is the ratchet mechanism central to the Paris Agreement, where the pledges must be enhanced every five years - the next deadline being the end of this year, 2020. The covid-19 crisis will obviously have an impact, unfortunately a negative one probably, but we would still likely see some increase in ambition.

That being said, of course, the agreement should ideally have been much stronger, containing binding targets for example. That is however not possible in an international political system in which there is no government, and where compromises have to be made. Binding targets would not have been agreed by many countries - including the US. 

The US pulling out of the agreement was indeed a very bad decision for the climate. 

To conclude, I of course hope that Americans understand the long-term implications of climate change, also for their own country and economy, and prioritize that in their voting in November. The United States is such a great country, with so much innovation and political power.

Since there seems to be an issue with energy sources, the question is what to do about it. This is my answer. If anyone has a different solution, I'd like to hear it. Let's begin with BTUs out vs BTU in by the energy source. 
Corn 1.3 / 1
Solar PV 9 / 1
Natural gas 10 / 1
Windmills 18 / 1
Light Water Reactors 80 / 1
Coal 80 / 1
Hydropower 100 / 1
Molten Salt Reactors and Traveling Wave Reactors 2,000 / 1 

Now, consider deaths per terawatt. 
Coal 161 
Oil 36 
Biomass 12 
Peat 12 
Natural gas 4 
Solar PV .44 
Wind  .15
Hydropower .10 
Light Water Reactors .04 
Molten Salt Reactors and Traveling Wave Reactors .003 
 This does not include the one to two million people that die annually from cooking with carbon-based fuels.  Solar ovens are by far the better way to go.
As you can see Molten Salt Reactors and Traveling Wave Reactors are the most cost-efficient and safest energy supply possible at this time. We should easily be able to reach $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour plus they can be used to manufacture ammonia, a direct replacement for diesel fuel. That brings the price of everything down substantially. Building small mass-produced modular breeder reactors would also make windmills and solar panels exceptionally cost-effective. We could have the population producing the majority of their own energy leaving nuclear energy for industry. Or we can continue with this absurd global warming debate.

In 1971, Richard Milhous Nixon and administration ordered the shutdown of the world's only molten salt reactor research facility (LFTR in 5 minutes on Youtube) without explanation other than budget cut.  If it had been allowed to go forward, we could have been mass-producing these breeder reactors by 1980.  Of course, this would have eliminated the fossil fuel and light water industries due directly to competition.  Considering the molten salt reactor BTU ratio is approximately 2,000 to 1 and solar panels are 9 to 1, that would give a multiplier effect of 2,000 * 9 = 18,000 to 1. Dividing this number by a coal-fired power plant BTU ratio of 80 to 1, would calculate to 18,000 / 80 = 225 times the increase in efficiency.  This does not include the price of batteries, which will also decrease in price, will cut the multiplier effect down somewhat.  Even still, doing so would flatten out the hierarchies of the world, creating vastly greater independence worldwide. This would accomplish exactly what the murderous communists attempted but badly failed at.  So, if this is all true, why haven't we done anything about it?  Two primary reasons, money is better invested elsewhere at this time and inertia. What we need another Manhattan Project if we wish to save our own butts and for the generations to come.  There already are companies that are investing in this technology like, Flibe Energy, Transatomic Power Corporation, ThorCon Power, Terrestrial Energy, Molex Energy, Seaborg Technologies, Copenhagen Atomics, and Terrapower.",0.0,0.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

The colonized and pillaged nations can't be asked to sign on and be accountable to high standards. They should get more wiggle room as they have been pillaged in the past (i.e. a late start in their development). What is missing in most agreements are clear targets that countries can be accountable for, not ambiguous words that don't state a definate number for baseline emissions and a definate target to reach to. Donations from the agreements by wealthier countries do help..but also How the money is spent is another problem. You can't ask a small country to change into future low carbon tech without they having the capability to recycle, fix and manage it. You also should focus on How they adapt to climate change NOT adopt technology as their reality is really trying to survive from all the big brother emissions. It's pretty sad at times, the demands and comments made as sometimes they lack consideration or being in someone else's shoes. But at the end of this, real numbers to track are needed from each. How they will be accountable is everyone's guess...but certainly punishment (less trade etc..) doesn't work.

A good analogy to this slow emergency of climate change is 9/11.  The national report on that tragic event pointed to a ""FAILURE OF IMAGINATION' as a major contributor to our lack of preparedness.  I would argue we face a similar situation with Climate Change that was exactly the situation our national defense teams faced before 9/11.  Weaponizing commercial aircraft by box cutter wielding terrorists seemed inconceivable. We now know this was quite feasible and apparently VERY LIKELY.  When we look at the forecasted damages climate change will bring such as sea level rise, depletion of glacial water sources (hint - Pakistani refugee nightmare), uninhabitable zones of the planet around the equator, mass climate refugee caravans, we now look at these as distant future issues with perhaps a GREATLY UNDERESTIMATED appreciation for how quickly and substantially this will impact us. I use the word us, because even the most privileged will be impacted in some manner but of course those least powerful and resourceless will be impacted the greatest (consistent with civilizations long history :). 
https://www.breakthroughonline.org.au/whatliesbeneath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI

I would argue that we are living in cognitive dissonance on this issue, especially in the developed world.  I have a car and a campervan that gets shitty mileage, but I love the experience and freedom of them both even though I know operating them is contributing to climate change.  Those that choose to deny climate change itself are in a different cognitive dissonance of understanding that fights to legitimize a way of life that is as inconsistent with their moral values just as my life is. These long-term slow emergencies create the most perplexing and devilishly difficult ironies in behavior to reconcile. I know it is happening, but I was born into this system and built this life around me. What can I ‚Äúreally‚Äù do and what would that mean to the things I have built (relationships, lifestyle, etc‚Ä¶)?

Solution: Fee & Dividend (AKA Carbon Tax)
A carbon fee ‚Äúat the well head‚Äù on fossil fuels. This will increase the price on goods (and of course petroleum products such as gas). This will be the unpopular perception of a Fee & Dividend plan that must be overcome with the dividend portion that is paid back to citizens to offset increases. This dividend would be paid to all citizens and thus would provide an actual dose of stimulus (and social justice) to those most impacted by the fee portion.  
What about other countries that don‚Äôt have a fee on fossil fuels?  Those countries would be required to pay a border duty on imported fossil fuels.  These countries will quickly see the wisdom in not paying the fee to the importing country and likely institute their own fee plan to keep those monies in country.  This way the Fee & Dividend scheme self-polices and propagates across the globe to deal with this global problem.

This is not an experiment so there are still confounds but if the world consistently stays cool after we lower the carbon levels we may have a case for human caused climate change. Even if the cooling down is a coincidence we want it to cool down anyway so that wouldn't be such a bad thing either.

More CO2 means less oxygen because the carbon from fossil fuels binds to oxygen to form the new CO2 in the first place. The effect on the oxygen concentration is negligible. However, a high CO2 concentration makes it impossible for humans and other animals to thrive. Humans can only concentrate well at up to 1200 ppm CO2, if it's higher you're just tired all the time. That's why windows have to be opened regularly. If the atmospheric CO2 reaches some 600-700 ppm, any crowded room will be unbearable within few minutes of people entering.

The greenhouse effect of CO2, N2O and Methane creates way more dangers to the entire ecosystem than you gain from the slight increase in crop yields. The current increases can't be attributed to CO2, they are a result of synthetic fertilizers and intensive farming (which is anything but sustainable).",0.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

Changes in the Earth‚Äôs orbit around the sun affects the amount of seasonal sunlight reaching the Earth‚Äôs surface. In the case of warming, the lag between temperature and CO2 is explained as follows: as ocean temperatures rise, oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, this release amplifies the warming trend, leading to yet more CO2 being released. In other words, increasing CO2 levels become both the cause and effect of further warming. This positive feedback is necessary to trigger the shifts between glacials and interglacials as the effect of orbital changes is too weak to cause such variation on their own.

The greenhouse effect   of CO2 is very small. Atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis
shows CO2 IS only capable of absorbing 7% of the  infrared electro magnetic spectrum  in the 15 micrometer frequency range CO2 has a very weak green house effect
Water vapor has about 850% stronger than CO2

The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn‚Äôt create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can‚Äôt speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what‚Äôs going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly  up or down, which‚Äôs effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is CO2 that is man made.

Since John is a faithful supporter of Trump, it's of course not surprising that he provides a shallow, false view of the Paris Agreement.

Measuring the positive impacts of the Paris Agreement is too complex for this channel. It is by now a central document for international climate governance, and is integrated in many multilateral processes. It is true that the initial pledges were not at all in line with the temperature goals - but those pledges were just that, initial. What John did not include is the ratchet mechanism central to the Paris Agreement, where the pledges must be enhanced every five years - the next deadline being the end of this year, 2020. The covid-19 crisis will obviously have an impact, unfortunately a negative one probably, but we would still likely see some increase in ambition.

That being said, of course, the agreement should ideally have been much stronger, containing binding targets for example. That is however not possible in an international political system in which there is no government, and where compromises have to be made. Binding targets would not have been agreed by many countries - including the US. 

The US pulling out of the agreement was indeed a very bad decision for the climate. 

To conclude, I of course hope that Americans understand the long-term implications of climate change, also for their own country and economy, and prioritize that in their voting in November. The United States is such a great country, with so much innovation and political power. Speaking from an EU perspective, we long for the day where we can once again be allies, so that together we can push emerging economies like China towards true climate action instead of being locked in to fossil fuels.",3.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

are some scientific facts that clearly show that an increase in CO2
does not lead to any significant increase in temperature






The
co2 concentration today is 400ppm. The temperature is circa 18c.


in
the Jurassic period the co2 concentration was 2000ppm, [5 times
greater than today] the temperature was 22c.


in
the Triassic period the co2 concentration was 2500ppm [ 6 times
greater than today] the temperature was 22c. 


in
the Ordovician period the co2 concentration was 3000ppm [7.5 times
greater than today] the temperature was 17c 


in
the Cambrian period the co2 concentration was 6000ppm [15 times
greater than today] the temperature was 22c 






For
most of the time the planet was thriving not frying, the data shows
that temperature is independent of co2 concentration 


Look
at the data for the Cambrian. The co2 concentration is 15 times what
it is today but the temperatures is about the same as it is today.
Look at the Ordovician , the CO2 concentration was 7.5 greater
than it is today and yet the temperature was 2 degrees lower

Here's my point in Tucson Arizona where I live I've seen probably two maybe three 116 or 117 days in the summer that being said it hasn't increased much in fact this year was a much milder summer then it was I don't 5 years ago maybe. But you know what has gotten worse the past four years Winters. In fact last year on the new year it snowed so much in Tucson for the first time since like the 60s that we had almost an inch of snow. Do you know how rare that is in Tucson Arizona it literally did it New Year's Day at like midnight no joke. Now I speculate my mom sent that to me as a goodbye gift from heaven but that's a whole separate story cuz my mom died November of last year. So it's a running joke that my mom sent it to me because I miss snow cuz I'm from the Midwest originally. Anyway the point is so Tucson every winter has been way colder I'd say the past I don't know 5 years maybe I've been here for over a decade I've been here since I turned 21 so about 13 years. And I'm telling you what I used to have no problems in the winter because yeah it was cool but at night it wasn't this cold but damn if it hasn't gotten worse. And I mean significantly worse we've had three fries Des already or three fries and mornings at the very least where it's been 35 or under. It's not even the end of December typically this weather or it's that cold at night doesn't hit us until the middle of January if that if at all. I'm just saying that I know Winters have gotten worse here significantly worse this day seem about the same you know we're running you know 50 60 degree days pretty standard. It might be slightly warmer during the day but it's definitely way colder at night so I don't know if that's normal. It's never been normal since I've lived here but maybe I'm wrong but I know Winters are getting worse in the midwest to in fact it's been sort of a tease about how we moved out of Illinois just in the nick of a hair because the winter started getting worse when we left. Now don't get me wrong they were bad when I live there but not tons of blizzards bad. I think in my entire life growing up in Illinois we left when I was 13 I came back when I was about 19 we maybe had 10 blizzards maybe that's a that's an overestimation. In fact I would say more likely we had for that I can recall once were the snow drifts were so bad they actually touched the roof of our school but we had class the next day despite the fact that it was a bad blizzard and then they had to send us home in the middle of school day because the snow drifts had covered the front doors and they were afraid that we get stuck inside and have to stay there a week if we didn't get out then there was the time my dog who is notorious for running away I got out and ran away Ikea always dead but this time it was a blizzard and I was terrified he was going to die cuz I had just given him a very dumb haircuts I was a little kid and I was stupid so I went out with my baby sister and neither of us were bundled up well we both ended up with frostbite bad frostbite we almost lost parts of our hand because of it one year on Halloween because we can go trick or treating so I remember that distinctly and one year where it was so bad the electrical poles froze and it broke and because of the weight of the The Ice that have built up on the electrical line actually broke the lines and we almost got electrocuted walking out of her house so that one stands out but I don't remember any other blizzards there must have been other ones but this all is such a rare occurrence when I was growing up but now that they've had for blizzards in my hometown in the past two years that is insane they've never had weather like that so I agree that global warming is a thing climate change is a thing but I don't think it's human-made because if it were the US should be balling because quite frankly despite the fact that we produce more emissions two times more than the rest of the planet we're actually a fairly green economy considering you know where the most Global economical country on planet Earth yet things aren't improving things were worse 10 years ago so of changing our Behavior was helping wouldn't we see better weather not worse,1.0,0.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

You've probably never heard of this person; a Danish scientist by the name of Bjorn Lomborg [in the above video and his most current findings in the link at the bottom of the paragraph], who¬†a few years back wrote a very important book published by Cambridge. As you know Cambridge is very prestigious, and known for having people of the highest intellect. The book was¬†titled ""The Skeptical Environmentalist."" Thats unheard of today. A scientist that wrote a book called The Skeptical¬†Environmentalist. In it he¬†debunked all the environmental positions b/c he KNEW it was based on ""politics and lobbying"" which led to $$$...lots of $$$, which then led to ""pseudo and consensus science."" He was vilified as a heretic by his peers, and the ""Scientific American Journal"" and he found himself¬†on the outside looking in. If you've never heard about ""consensus science"" or a¬†""consensus of scientists"" let me enlighten you. First understand that it means there is NO EVIDENCE...no REAL proof b/c ""consensus"" is NOT science; thats why it took¬†over. Also, it will sound something like: ""A large group of scientists agree that""... Is this how science is done; by vote? TRUE science has nothing to do with consensus. Science requires investigators and researchers who've found ""FACTS"" via repetition, measurement,¬†and observation.¬†Consensus is irrelevant.¬†If its consensus, its not science.¬†Consensus is invoked only in situations where there is a political, social,¬†or $$$ gain¬†w/o scientific support, and climate change¬†has created¬†the [no pun intended], ""perfect storm.""¬†No one ever says ""the consensus of a large number of scientists is that E=MC square"" or you'll never hear ""the consensus of a large number of scientists is that the sun is 93 million miles from the earth""...statements like these are not made b/c they're¬†FACTS. You don‚Äôt need a consensus b/c it has¬†NOTHING to do with it. YOU DON'T VOTE ON FACTS. Did you know that there is absolutely NO extant ""scientific"" data [observable¬†evidence] regarding Co2 or carbon, showing that mankind contributes to warming...NONE...its ALL merely theory i.e. ""consensus science"" which it has to be b/c its NOT; let me repeat; NOT evidenced via observation / science! Actually the opposite [scientifically] appears to be true, and this is what happens in layman‚Äôs terms. The sun gets hotter, and as¬†it fluctuates, it gets hotter at certain times more than at other times, and when that happens it warms the oceans. As the oceans are warmed, THEY release more Co2 [which IS a scientific FACT, and has been for decades].¬†So, the¬†sun determines the warming. The warming then effects the oceans, meaning that the oceans¬†release more Co2 into the atmosphere. The ""fact"" then is this: Its NOT ppl putting Co2 into the atmosphere that warms the climate, its the sun that warms the climate, and the oceans are¬†putting more Co2 in the atmosphere. ALL ""honest"" legitimate science¬†shows that the human contribution to Co2 is barely negligible. Water vapor and clouds make up almost ALL Co2. Climate change then, is the effect of electro magnetic fields on the sun THEREFORE; environmentalists who say we‚Äôre increasing the amount of Co2, and consequently warming the environment currently are, and have been,¬†""purposefully lying"" b/c they ALL HAVE this scientific proof/data, yet they have NO real scientific support or data for what they have been telling the public, but what they do have is much more $$$ for their research. This link¬†is a wealth of real ""science and information"" regarding Lomborg's latest work concerning¬†Global Warming: https://cei.org/blog/bjorn-lomborg-and-john-christy-shred-climate-alarmism


What does all this prove?¬†Real science [measurable, repetitive, and that which is observable, which is what science means] regarding climate change has only been being measured for a few decades; thats it, and the earth‚Äôs temperature has risen 1-2 degrees [depending on which study is sited]. The best that REAL science can tell, from 1940 to 1970, it was cooler than it‚Äôs been from the 70s to the present. So it has gotten a little warmer. But we really don‚Äôt know how many times that‚Äôs happened in the past b/c we don‚Äôt have any way to measure it. All we really KNOW is that the temperature is up 1-2 degrees; whoopee!!! The actual truth is this: the most accurate, and the latest science says that there is a direct correlation between sun spots, and climate changes.¬†Also, sun spots are visible, and discernible meaning¬†that solar variations are driven by temperature. The sun is the source of temperature changes with its infrared variations which, like I said, IS discernible so ACTUAL SCIENCE¬†can be done.¬†As a Christian, I believe what the Bible teaches regarding our planets last days; the earth¬†is in the hands of its creator God, therefore; nothing¬†except God¬†will have any effect on its ending.¬†https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-361¬†¬† /¬†¬† https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-362/~/about¬†¬†¬† /¬†¬† We should NEVER be irresponsible with what we've been blessed with, but understand that a ""new"" $16 trillion, U.S. proposition¬†is foolish, and futile. Do our U.S. politicians believe that America represents the entire world? Will China, India, Russia and so on, invest multiple trillions to ""save the planet"" via OUR new deal? These scenarios will not work, even if the earth were pristine TODAY, and if the whole earth emitted¬†""zero"" Co2 emissions¬†from this point on. Please don't let this next statement cause you to stop reading b/c you don't believe in God. This is valid scientific evidence even for atheists. The Bible states exactly how ""things will end"" and none of them are¬†related to polar ice caps melting, asteroids hitting the earth, or any other ""alien"" man made fears. God will ""uncreate"" all that He has created just as scripture says:¬†""But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth, and its works will be burned up""¬†[2 Peter 3:10]. Sadly,¬†people today¬†dismiss the accounts and warning given in the Bible; accounts such as ""Noah's flood""¬†even though the earth is replete with ""clear factual scientific evidence"" of that¬†event. Its even more clear¬†WHY scientists desire an alternative answer. Scientists understand the fallout of admitting to Biblical ""truth"" meaning, that if¬†it is found to be true, there should then be a¬†need to adhere to the rest of what the Bible says, and people are purposefully unwilling to do that. I only know of¬†ONE scientist who was honest enough to admit to why he didn't want the Bibles claims to be found true: Aldous Huxley; who¬†openly admitted that his rejection of religion was due to the fact that he did not want his sexual freedom hindered! [Jackson 1974, 3]. This is the truth of things and ""truth"" is a stubborn thing. Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call upon Him while He is near. Isaiah 55:6 


If you're a student of ""facts"" and are convinced by them, then these should interest you; if you're¬†willing to watch:

The US puts out double the emissions per person than China and India. Think about that for a second. The US has a population of roughly 327 million people. India and China each have over a billion people and being made up of mostly third world conditions for the vast majority of the populations. Plus the emissions put out by the US are already cleaner versions of the many different greenhouse products that exist. Think New York/LA in the 80's and 90's vs modern NY/LA and compare the air quality to modern India or Urban China. You can't see through the skyline because of the air pollution. China burns so much coal the sky is continuously blotted out for days at a time in some cities. They burn so much coal, wood, and organic matter in India that some places can be lucky to see two streets down sometimes. And dont even get me started on the water pollution. Why do you think a stereotypical caricature of Asia is masses of people with little white or blue hospital masks on walking down the street? Could it be because both India and China make up a signficant part of Asia? But maybe we are also cranked our own greenhouse emissions and WE SHOULD ALL SLOW DOWN OUR EMISSIONS? 

Just sayin. Little food for thought. But you realize an industrial economy cant just immediately stop and reduce its emissions immediately right? It would cause its entire economy to collapse. And their isnt enough time in big countries like India and China to somehow miraculously switch to renewable for the entire country without their entire economy slowing way down which would, in turn, slow the WORLD economy way down, which would cause the US economy to slow down. Do you see how there are a multitude of levels and considerations that have to be taken into account before haulting all emissions at once for a modern 1st world economy? 

I think that might be why lawyers, economists, and businessmen worked out the Paris Climate Accord and not a has been hack reporter that's apparently lost his mind.

This is 252 million per year (PER PERSON - there are 7 BILLION people on the planet = 1,764,000,000,000 [1,764,000,000 litres = 176,400 TONNES - PER DAY = 64,386,000 tonnes PER YEAR]). The science sites show this is by FAR the biggest source of carbon dioxide. Add to this ALL ANIMALS on the planet. Guesses are 100 million tonnes per year. Add to that carbon dioxide from the animals and plants in the oceans.  Add to that volcanoes.

Since plants ingest (NEED) carbon dioxide, and it's even said that one's plants will grow better if you talk to them (they get EXCESS carbon dioxide), then we actually need MORE!

But, if we want to rid ourselves of this ""crisis!"" (how many people per year die from warmth?  How many die per year from heart attacks? Smoking? Drunk driving?) Maybe we should tackle THOSE before the warmth (!!!!!!)?

So, if all humans just STOP BREATHING, the ""crisis"" will be averted.  *I* say: all those who are ""up in arms"" about this ""crisis"" - should be the example.  The first to stop breathing. Stop driving your car.  By the way, your electric car causes 7x the carbon dioxide footprint and toxic pollution of a regular car!

THEN we can talk to the animals, and the volcanoes and the life under the sea.

Although John follows the party line in glossing over this, it is now established fact in mathematics that our CO2 emissions from fossil fuels is killing the planet and that our mass extinction will start after the year 2030. 

That‚Äôs not left or right thinking. That‚Äôs the mathematical conclusion of 11000 scientists from around the world. All their analysis is coming back the same. If you were sitting next to these people in school, you‚Äôd be copying their homework. So to argue against it now is like arguing 2+2 no longer equals 4! 

Yet politicians who are in the pocket of the top 100 corporations that are causing 70% of the pollution, continue to do nothing. Globally!

Yes, Trump pulled the US out of the Paris accord. But he has done nothing else about it. What alternative has he proposed. The American continent is transforming as a result of this problem. So it doesn‚Äôt matter who is contributing now. What matters is protecting the country. Wildfires are raging in California in November. Aquifers from the west coast to Nebraska are drying out, as the south and west transforms into dessert. Arctic cold is heightening winters along the eastern seaboard. The south east states of Louisiana and Florida are being lost to rising sea levels, so America already has internal climate refugees. Hurricanes are strengthening due to increased sea temperatures in the Caribbean, due to reduced flow in the Atlantic conveyor current.

So that leaves only one question. Why?

This lacks scope, scientific perspectives and focuses on an opinion without any statistics or actual data. The reason that the Paris Accord does allow nationally determined contributions (NDCs) is because the previous major climate treaties 'Kyoto Protocol' set out mandatory targets for developed nations, and voluntary targets for developing nations (which still included China, India, etc) and obviously didn't work. The reason was because these nations (excluding some few), weren't allowed the privilege of heavily previously using fossil fuels in the past for economic gain as seen in the industrialisation period in Britain and America.. Hence much of the emissions had come disproportionately from the developed countries.

Since John is a faithful supporter of Trump, it's of course not surprising that he provides a shallow, false view of the Paris Agreement.

Measuring the positive impacts of the Paris Agreement is too complex for this channel. It is by now a central document for international climate governance, and is integrated in many multilateral processes. It is true that the initial pledges were not at all in line with the temperature goals - but those pledges were just that, initial. What John did not include is the ratchet mechanism central to the Paris Agreement, where the pledges must be enhanced every five years - the next deadline being the end of this year, 2020. The covid-19 crisis will obviously have an impact, unfortunately a negative one probably, but we would still likely see some increase in ambition.

That being said, of course, the agreement should ideally have been much stronger, containing binding targets for example. That is however not possible in an international political system in which there is no government, and where compromises have to be made. Binding targets would not have been agreed by many countries - including the US. 

The US pulling out of the agreement was indeed a very bad decision for the climate. 

To conclude, I of course hope that Americans understand the long-term implications of climate change, also for their own country and economy, and prioritize that in their voting in November. The United States is such a great country, with so much innovation and political power. Speaking from an EU perspective, we long for the day where we can once again be allies, so that together we can push emerging economies like China towards true climate action instead of being locked in to fossil fuels.",0.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

Raising taxes on the rich just gets the rich to stop spending money on things like their businesses and creating jobs. High tax rates aren't even paid.

And income is earned, not distributed. The US is not supposed to distribute income. That is against what America and freedom is. 


And lowering taxes is NOT, absolutely not ""giving them money"". It's not the government's money. The government didn't earn the money. The people earned it. Yes, the government can tax. That is necessary in order to pay for a government. But to say it is giving people money because after the government takes it away from you, they can decide to spend it on a road is ludicrous.

It's an example of the government TAKING less of the money someone earned. It's the person's money. Not yours and not government's. 


Second, Rich people invest in companies, machinery, their own businesses, which creates jobs. Buying luxury items means jobs for the people who build, maintain and sell the luxury items. I never understood how blind people could be when they criticized Mitt Romney for having an elevator in his house. Who did they think built the elevator? Who installed it? Who repairs it? Who designs it? Rich people or the working class? That's right. The working class. Do you have any idea how much money I made installing carpet in the movie theater rooms in the homes of millionaires? A lot. I supported my family with that job. 


Third, when you cut taxes, the IRS takes in more money. It happens every time and it's happened this time as well. So the government actually has more money to spend on what you think it should be spent on because those rich people grow their businesses, which means hiring more people, which means increasing the tax base. Increasing the tax base means more people are working and paying taxes, so the government collects more money. Less money per person, but there are more people paying taxes. If I charge you $100 a year, I get $100 a year. If I charge you $75 a year and a new guy gets a job and I charge him $75 a year, I just increased the amount of money I collect to $150 a year. So I lowered what I charge per person, but I have more people to charge. 


National debt is something Democrats worry about ONLY when a Republican is in office. Like I said, I am not happy about that either, but as fart as military spending, we need to spend money on the military. It's what keeps us safe and the military was in horrible shape before Trump took office. Half of the fighter jets weren't even flight worthy. 


Man made climate change is a myth. It's nonsense that politicians use to get people to agree to the government telling them what to do and to take more of their money. Well sure, pick my pocket if it's going to save the planet. That is such freaking nonsense. I can't believe anyone falls for that crap.

Even if you don't want the money for any of that, larger tax cuts for average wage earners are possible if you don't cut taxes on high incomes. 

There are other serious downsides to Trump's policies, like the massively rising natl debt, the increasing military spending despite his promise to stop wasting money on war, environmental rollbacks and his total inaction on climate change (even if the Paris Accord is badly insufficient).

What they all fail to mention and recognize is that the earths climate goes in cycles. Read through the farmers almanac over the last two hundred years and you will have your proof. Also consider this, the carbon we breath out the vegetation whether tree, blade of grass or some type of produce we eat takes that carbon and combines it for their own building blocks and gives back the oxygen it removes from the carbon molecules. 

    Yes that‚Äôs right for those of you who never paid attention to earth science class in the eight grade in school. The trees and other plants that are green or have green leaves or green needles if it‚Äôs an evergreen or conifer need carbon dioxide to live and grow. 

    If any of them are so truly interested in our atmospheric conditions then just plant more trees and grow various gardens. 

    Any one who has a green thumb and house plants will tell you they sometimes talk to their plants. It gives them a little more oxygen and gives the plant a little more carbon dioxide. 

    There was an independent test years ago where a man planted three pine trees and tented them. The one with the reduced co2 in the tent had stunted growth whereas the one for the control group was the usual height and amount of foliage for typical atmosphere and the one with an increased amount of co2 was a third larger than the control and twice as big as the one with the reduced amount by the percentage that was said to be most favorable. 

    Now then consider this. The amount of toxic fumes spewed out by the active volcanoes is far worse than we can produce and that is scientific fact. Same way they discovered that the hole in the ozone never goes away as it expands and contracts. It was always there. No then explain how it can be there when it is the natural tendency for any gas to expand and fill a space.

This news is from November of 2017 for Christ‚Äôs Sake!

The UN Admits That The Paris Climate Deal Was A Fraud

The day Obama threw America‚Äôs economy under the bus.
Global Hot Air: Here‚Äôs a United Nations climate report that environmentalists probably don‚Äôt want anybody to read. It says that even if every country abides by the grand promises they made last year in Paris to reduce greenhouse gases, the planet would still be ‚Äúdoomed.‚Äù

When President Obama hitched America to the Paris Accord in 2016, he declared that it was ‚Äúthe moment that we finally decided to save our planet.‚Äù And when Trump pulled out of the deal this year, he was berated by legions of environmentalists for killing it.

But it turns out that the Paris accord was little more than a sham that will do nothing to ‚Äúsave the planet.‚Äù

According to the latest annual UN report on the ‚Äúemissions gap,‚Äù the Paris agreement will provide only a third of the cuts in greenhouse gas that environmentalists claim is needed to prevent catastrophic warming. If every country involved in those accords abides by their pledges between now and 2030 ‚Äî which is a dubious proposition ‚Äî temperatures will still rise by 3 degrees C by 2100. The goal of the Paris agreement was to keep the global temperature increase to under 2 degrees.

Eric Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment Program, which produces the annual report, said this week that ‚ÄúOne year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future. Governments, the private sector and civil society must bridge this catastrophic climate gap.‚Äù

The report says unless global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020, the CO2 levels will be way above the goal set for 2030, which, it goes on, will make it ‚Äúextremely unlikely that the goal of holding global warming to well below 2 degrees C can still be reached.‚Äù

Not to worry. The UN claims that closing this gap will be easy enough if nations set their collective minds to it.

But this is a fantasy. The list of what would need to be done by 2020 ‚Äî a little over two years from now ‚Äî includes: Boosting renewable energy‚Äôs share to 30%. Pushing electric cars to 15% of new car sales, up from less than 1% today. Doubling mass transit use. Cutting air travel CO2 emissions by 20%. And coming up with $1 trillion for ‚Äúclimate action.‚Äù

Oh, and coal-fired power plants would have to be phased out worldwide, starting now.

According to the report, ‚Äúphasing out coal consumption ‚Ä¶ is an indispensable condition for achieving international climate change targets.‚Äù That means putting a halt to any new coal plants while starting to phase out the ones currently in use.

Good luck with that. There are currently 273 gigawatts of coal capacity under construction around the world, and another 570 gigawatts in the pipeline, the UN says. That would represent a 42% increase in global energy production from coal. Does anyone really think developing countries who need coal as a cheap source of fuel to grow their economies will suddenly call it quits?

So, does this mean the planet is doomed? Hardly. As we have noted in this space many times, all those forecasts of global catastrophe are based on computer models that have been unreliable predictors of warming. And all of the horror stories assume the worst.

What the report does make clear, however, is that all the posturing by government leaders in Paris was just that. Posturing. None of these countries intended to take the drastic and economically catastrophic steps environmentalist claim are needed to prevent a climate change doomsday.  As such, Trump was right to stop pretending.

Whether you believe in climate change or not, the Paris climate accord amounted to nothing, or pretty close to it. Even the UN admits that now.",0.0,0.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

He is a pawn.
He controls nothing, a man baby who's NEVER not been boss,
 he knows nothing of real expectations, reality, & listening to other people.

& like Hitler,
 is an intolerable cantankerous psychotic, stoned on Meth nearly every day.
(He snorts Adderall, or Cocaine, most days he has to be on Camera)
Fun Fact : 
 When seen without his 1 inch thick foundation make-up, put on for public appearances,
 you can see the ridges of 2 semicircular shunts put on ea side of his nose, to stop his nasal cavity fr collapsing any further..
 Look at a compilation of his press conferences & you'll see him sniff half way through.
 He likes to keep it short..

After firing everyone he possibly can,
 the goods on this human garbage who holds office, are becoming more obvious ea passing day.

 My bet is his unscheduled stop to a hospital a few months ago was a mild heart attack,
 & it will happen again as his paper thin emotional character gets rocked by plummeting approval ratings.
 One way or another, his days are numbered.

John Stossel and the ultra-conservative Manhattan Institute misrepresent pretty much everything here. It isn't the case that China just stated that it would do what it already plans to do. In fact, it stated that it would aim to reduce CO2 BEFORE 2030, and 2030 at the latest, which given growth and energy consumption projections, is actually a huge REDUCTION of the long term trend. But that's just the beginning. China also pledged to source 20% of its energy from low-carbon sources by 2030 and to cut emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% of 2005 levels by 2030, potentially putting it on course to peak by 2027. The EU pledged a whopping 40% reduction by 2030. India pledged A 33-35% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Also pledges to achieve 40% of cumulative electricity installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based resources by 2030. Will also increase tree cover, creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030. India intends to cover the $2.5 trillion cost of its pledge with both domestic and international funds. The carbon sink and shift to sustainable energy production is huge because it reduces carbon output while allowing increased energy usage in the future; a trend that we must have if we are to succeed in reducing CO2. Brazil, critically agreed to A 37% reduction in emissions by 2025, compared to 2005 levels, with a further indicative target of a 43% reduction in emissions by 2030. Sudan, which is one of the poorest countries on earth, and uses 5% of the energy that the US does per capita (or to put it another way, Americans use twenty times more energy than Sudanese) has actually agreed to To reach 20% renewable share in the power mix by 2030. Includes detailed per-technology aims and targets for energy efficiency. Aims to raise forest area to 25% of Sudan by 2030, which, for a desert/arid and war-torn country is remarkable. And this doesn't even include all the rest of the countries or the very detailed plan for assistance, oversight and technological innovation, research, cooperation, etc... this is by far the best agreement the world has EVER SEEN. And what did the United States pledge? A 26-28% domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005, making its best effort to reach the 28% target, which is hardly the most difficult reduction given what other countries have committed to doing. This video is totally wrong. You can read the document yourself and all of the CORRECT discussion of the Paris Accords. This isn't surprising. The US thinks it is getting ripped off by the rest of the world, but it is the opposite, the US is saying ""you all make cut backs and sacrifices, even the poorest countries, we will continue to gobble up and consume more energy than anyone... how dare you ask us to shift our consumption habits.""

You can read them for yourself here in the INDC database https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx  The statement that China is not doing anything they set out to already do is just a lie. China has actually improved on it's National Plan For Climate Change, which was originally used for the initial Paris Accord, but now they are expecting increased economic growth beyond the original projections, which would mean increased emissions, but they are actually increasing sustainable energy generation, particularly hydro, which is going to keep them on track despite the increased growth. This means that their rate of CO2 reduction has actually increased. Everyone should look at the INDCs and see what other, far poorer, countries are comitting to, and then ask themselves why the United States can't do something... maybe it is because the fossil fuel industry owns the federal government and you won't see much being done to reduce fossil fuel emissions until that changes, and that doesn't look like it's going to change, short of some revolution that takes money out of politics... but in America, spending money to buy elections is considered constitutionally protected free speech according to the supreme court.",0.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

His logic is very weak here, ""Pakistan and India barely committed to anything so why should we?"" . There are 180 other members in it, so what are they doing? And base your judgement on the average and leaders, not the bottom of the barrel. He even admits at 3:38 that the earth is warming and we may be contributing, but he throws rhetoric of ""the solution isn't to waste billions"", well of course not. You would really have to look at what else is being done before you decided what is wasted billions. Caring for the planet is a good thing. I fail to see the push for the environment as a Democratic/Socialist powergrab/regulation spree. Clean air and clean water should are in everyone's best interest. 
And believe it or not I strongly feel the Open borders movement in Europe and the US is fueled by the desire to have many more desperate workers who are more worried about their paychecks than the environment.

Your behind the curve , we are what science calls "" the pause ""

You do realize they've been caught , NOAA and NASA publish monthly Earth tempatures .The problem they enter falsified tempatures from thousands if stations ... ..They are routinely caught publishing false tempatures.And the Vostok ice core samples have destroyed their theroy that higher tempatures produce an increase in C02 levels.
 Another fact they were not counting on .The exact opposite is the case .just another "" theroy "" that has been completely debunked .
Don't you find it insane that these so called nameless false consensus do not take into account the biggest driver of earths tempatures ?

The public, in general, is irritated that there is a doomsday scenario that threatens their future plans. Many choices may seem a good idea but one thing we hate is too many choices. Is there evidence? A scientist may say yes, some say no. I've watched a heap of videos and quite frankly there seems more evidence that not. How long will it take? I think it may depend on how the cards fall. If the polar jet streams send the cold air south instead of around the North Pole (as we have been seeing), the ice caps are likely to melt. When that happens the frozen tundra will thaw and then the methane will be released and game over for the future of humanity.  Sure the world has been warm before, but the onset has been far slower, and besides, there were practically no humans to feed. We are no longer hunter-gatherers. One thing for sure is even if a small amount of environmental warming to occur, at least one or two billion lives may be lost. Then, we will have a major problem with desperate refugees climbing fences and they may even be American refugees. My only consolation is that I will be into my 70s by the time the future will be more clear. I do wonder about future generations though. John Stossel is a nice guy and is popular - a comforting face on TV. But, he's not a scientist. Remember scientists? These are the guys who revolutionized agriculture so we can feed the world.

Yes, cycles of warming followed by ice ages are normal.  However, about 97% of climate scientists believe that the use of carbon based fuels are a significant contributor to present cycle of global warming.  They DO NOT claim it is the ONLY reason.  Methane and other greenhouse gases, natural volcanic activity, as well as solar activity and the earth's orbit are also probably contributing.  The degree to which man made activity is responsible for global warming is still NOT clearly understood.  We DO know that the planet is warming even faster than the models predicted 20 years ago.

Global temperatures aren't plateauing at all. There was a brief plateau in the 50s to 70s before the sharp increase continued. Look at any data on this, it's undeniable. Now, increases in temperature in general have not been harmful to the planet, the problem is that these increases (caused by human activity) are occurring many times faster, and without our action the consequences could be severe. And no, we are not ""learning"" that the sun is responsible. A small number of scientists have claimed it may be, which has been blown way out of proportion. For example many people are now claiming that NASA have announced this to be the case, when there is no evidence of them doing so and if you look at their own website it's clear that their stance is the exact opposite. 
I might be able to keep more of an open mind to the climate change deniers if they didn't change their arguments to suit the mood. First someone states that CO2 emissions are mostly natural and volcanoes emit more than human activity. Then someone says that we are releasing CO2, but there is no proof that it actually causes global warming. And finally you get the people who say it's all to do with the Sun, which is a nonsense argument based on the fact that temperatures are rising more quickly now than they ever have before. And some people insist that we are entering a period of cooling as a result of reduced solar activity. The argument is literally anything you can make up that sounds remotely feasible to someone who doesn't have a background in science, and when presented with scientific data it is immediately tossed aside as ""fake"". I didn't come here to a video full of people with one opinion expecting anybody to agree with me, but it's genuinely shocking how closed-minded all these people who insist we keep an open mind are.

So much of what people need to know is what they are not telling people. Warming temps coincide with rises in civilizations and colder temps with starvation, disease and downfalls of civilizations. After reading articles on this subject for years (since and including the famous Time magazine article on the next ice age) I was always a skeptic.

I knew they did not understand our complex climate to the extent needed to be able to say how much CO2 each country needed to make reductions on in order to ""hold"" the rising temps at 2C.

NASA's own website. Look at the section on the right. ""The most recent analyses of these proxies indicate that solar irradiance changes cannot plausibly account for more than 10 percent of the 20th century‚Äôs warming""
Yes carbon dioxide is taken in by plants, but this carbon is then stored in the ground over millions of years, some of which becomes fossil fuels. This is a natural process for removing carbon from the atmosphere. Burning these fuels releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, breaking the delicate balance between animals and plants (and algae and many others). That is also simple science. Millions of years ago when the atmosphere held more CO2, the numbers of plants increased, thereby reducing atmospheric CO2 over a long period of time. This can of course happen naturally. The problem is that we are releasing it far far faster than would ever occur naturally. It's estimated that carbon dioxide levels are increasing around 100 times faster now than at their previous fastest rate within the last million years or so. It's impossible to accurately estimate for the more distant past, but we can attempt to predict the effect that this increase will have on the planet. That's what scientists are doing, and what you are refusing to believe because somebody on YouTube says they're wrong.
As for your part about following the money, why does everybody using this argument not seem to notice that the big oil companies have far more to gain by convincing people to continue investing in fossil fuels, than anybody has to gain by making up some elaborate lie about global warming? I'm sure plenty of people do use the situation for their own personal gain. There are always going to be selfish people out there. But it doesn't change the fact that most of the evidence we have says this is happening and it's our fault. More research needs to be done, as is always the case. But refusing to alter our lifestyles just on the off-chance that the current understanding is wrong is insane. 
Most of what governments are being asked to do makes sense for other reasons too. Use less oil? Even if you don't believe in global warming, oil supplies are finite and even if we discover more, it will at some point become more and more difficult to obtain, sending prices higher and higher. Eventually we will need to make the jump to more renewable energy sources anyway. So why not invest in them now rather than continuing to pour money into oil?",0.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

Where they state that man automobiles all of these things make absolutely no difference to our climate whatsoever. It has to do with the Sun and our changing orbit, this has been the science long before this nonsense about climate change. What happens with the sun affects our planet. Watch the video or read the news from NASA and then you'll understand. Do you really think that by getting rid of carbon dioxide you are saving the planet. We take in oxygen to live we expel carbon dioxide. The plants and the trees take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. It's been that way since the dawn of time. Now all of a sudden carbon dioxide is bad, take a look at a map showing what carbon dioxide is doing positively for our planet in Greening. Forest growth it's growing not diminishing. Think about this, the Obamas bought a 15 million dollar mansion in Martha's Vineyard. It is a large ocean front property. Their pal Al Gore said we're going to be underwater, do you think the Obamas spend 15 million so they would be underwater. Open your eyes. This is nothing but a wealth transfer that has been created and pushed for years from the UN and the other leftists around the planet. And take a look at your pal Al Gore, the amount electricity he uses for a 25000 square foot home in Tennessee. Do you realize how big that is. What he uses for electricity in a month would do a neighbourhood for a year.
There is an old saying that applies to this, follow the money. Gore has made hundreds of millions of dollars off of this, and he keeps talking about how cows are bad for the climate, with cow farts. Meanwhile he's the largest investor in the beyond meat hamburger patty. Does that sound like a conflict of interest?

""Climate change"" on the other hand can mean anything you want it to mean and does not refer to a scientifically testable hypothesis, because it implicitly evades any kind of prediction that can be used to hold its defender accountable.

""According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the world's volcanoes, both on land and undersea, generate about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, while our automotive and industrial activities cause some 24 billion tons of CO2 emissions every year worldwide.""


So no, human CO2 output is on average 100 times greater than all the volcanoes in the world combined. Maybe one single huge eruption (the kind you only see once every 1000 years) could outdo us, but even if it could, why should that justify continuing to release as much as we like? The amount of false information out there is ridiculous and if you have an actual source I'll happily look at it. I'm aware that Google is hardly scientifically reviewed but looking through the results leads to the conclusion that this figure is fairly well accepted.


The problem is that scientists are never at 100% consensus about anything at all - that doesn't mean the 99% aren't correct or there isn't enough evidence that we are having a significant impact. Climate change deniers will latch onto one single article claiming a calculation made at some point in time may be incorrect, even though nobody has made any subsequent calculation to disprove this. It's all speculation (and yes, I have seen the paper saying the volcano calculation may be incorrect, but it gives no measure of how much - it's still highly likely that human CO2 emissions are many times greater). At some point significant evidence MIGHT come to light proving climate change is not caused by human activity. If that happens, scientists will admit they were wrong. As they have done many times. Those doing the research have no agenda other than trying to save the planet. But it's very very unlikely that will happen. At the moment the overwhelming majority of evidence points towards the fact that yes, we are having a significant effect. Nobody is trying to guilt shame you. We're trying to save the planet.

4. To achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from nonfossil
fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and
low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF).
5. To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent
through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.
6. To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development
programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water
resources, Himalayan region, coastal regions, health and disaster management.
7. To mobilize domestic and new & additional funds from developed countries to
implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required
and the resource gap.
8. To build capacities, create domestic framework and international architecture for quick
diffusion of cutting edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R&D for
such future technologies.

No one stops to think for themselves, they just take what the governments say, and follow along with the media and their friends views to stay popular and trendy.

How many people have stopped to think about the people involved with this pact, and their lifestyles? The manners of transportation which they use to attend these meetings? The elaborate facilities these meetings are held in, with all their high tech, high resource consumption to build and keep running?
What about the homes these people live in? And, as I stated, their lifestyles..., which are much deeper ""carbon footprints"" than the average citizen of any of the countries they ""represent"" at these meetings.
None of those people ever do a thing to reduce their own ""carbon footprint"", why should they? They simply use the guilt to manipulate the average citizens to do that, and to continue accepting higher and higher taxes because they are told it is doing good.
If one were truly so concerned about ""climate change"" or ""global warming"", which ever you prefer to use, they would not use any technology such as computers, cell phones, etc., as these are some of the worst contributions to world wide pollution.
The resources required to make solar panels and ""green cars"" are far worse than resources to make regular, everyday cars. And they are all far worse when it comes time to discard and recycle.
But no one stops to ""think"" about these things, and if they do, they simply swallow the lies from those who benefit a great deal financially from making, selling and doing research related to those products.

It's all about money, and control. And this is what globalism is all about..., period.

The climate of the Earth has been changing since the day it began..., and it has, and will continue to do so. But people simply do not bother themselves to stop and ""think"" about these things.
Everyone wants to be a virtue warrior, so they simply swallow any and all lies, and repeat what they hear from others and the media.

In fact, the true source of environmental impacts on the Earth..., is..., ""humans"". Over population, more and more consumption each and every year, more resources required to sustain an ever hungry, ever growing consumer population.
We justify killing animals because it helps control the spread of disease, and over-population..., when the truth is, people fear wild animals which can be dangerous to us.
But we never seem to lump humans into that category. And humans, are the worst plague to ever inhabit the Earth. And also the most dangerous.
We cry out ""save the trees, and the rainforest!!!"" Yet everyone continues to purchase products which come from their destruction, without the faintest sight nor sign of guilt, all while posting constant virtue posts to your facebook feeds.
Continuously raping the Earth to feed our gluttonous desires for MORE! And stripping her of nature in order to build more housing for an ever over growing, over population of our disease.

This video is a classic case of quote mining and misquotes. All of the info below is directly from the documents submitted by the countries concerned.

China's first commitment (of four) is the peak emissions thing mentioned. The second one is ""To lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% from the 2005 level"" (this quote is in a list of things to do by 2030). That's a pretty concrete commitment.

Stossel misquoted India's third commitment (of eight) by adding a full stop at the end of the word intensity.
""To reduce the emissions intensity.""
vs
""To reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level.""
It's clear that he is quoting this sentence (and that he therefore read the rest), as the sentence on its own would be ""To reduce emissions intensity"". Very dishonest quoting.
Incidentally, India's fourth commitment is ""To achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030."" Again, a very concrete commitment.

The US, had only 1 commitment.
""achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025""
If you read the literal wording of it it says ""in 2025"", no emissions reduction is required until the year 2025, or after it. The US was literally only committed to having slightly lower emissions for 1 year.

So let's not pretend this was a bad deal for the US in particular. The two examples of countries who got better deals very clearly had similar commitments.

Stossel also says ""Of course it's true that the United States produces twice as much greenhouse gas per person as China and India""
2.35x for China. 9.82x for India. (Source: International Energy Agency)
So, while this figure is honest enough for China (allowing a bit of journalistic exaggeration), it is nowhere near being true for India. 9 times as much per capita is nothing like ""twice as much"".

This was a deal leaning heavily in favour of the US when looked at from this angle. If this were really about fairness in emissions (let's not kid ourselves) Trump would be proposing the same level of emissions per person i.e. China levelling off, India being allowed to increase emissions by 417% and a 63% reduction for the US. That would be fair (assuming we didn't want to count past emissions).

Before I get straw-manned, I don't think India increasing by 417%, or the US decreasing by 63% is a good idea. Let's just set a price on the global resource of clean air and let the market decide what's fair.

Undoubtedly this comment will bring all kinds of people wanting to take the argument in different directions. I'm happy to go in these directions. But first let's agree on two things.

The word abrupt means that the change is occurring too fast for anything or anybody to do anything meaningful about it, because too many additional events have already been triggered.

 When humans were burning down forests and using coal to heat their poorly insulated homes, we had global dimming and the global climate was unnaturally getting cooler. Now that everyone is burning ""cleaner"" fossil fuels, we have the global greenhouse affect and most places are now getting warmer. So weather we were moving towards another Ice Age, or now a Hothouse Earth depends on the time period you are looking at.

Water - sustainable, relatively clean, easy, and can deliver stead baseload and on-demand peak loads.
Geothermal - sadly not available in most regions, but great for energy-hogs like home-heating.
And nuclear - still the cleanest form of energy (chernobyl released less radiation for its power, the catastrophe included, than Coal powerplants do).

US had camels, elephants, rinos, and horses when the climate was warmer and wetter, the way it is supposed to be! One can show this, below, to the climate cultists and they will still deny the truth.

Maybe that's not correct, I don't know, but it seems to me if your going to have ice sheets covering North America, it's gotta be way cooler than 2 degrees! And if you really want to know what I think, your the one who is ignorant here! How about you try doing some real research. I've heard both sides myself and the once you look at the big picture, you'll see climate change has few legs to stand on. You can try searching for these guys on YouTube that I like: Alex Epstein, Patrick Moore and Bob Carter. Of course, you already have your views, so I doubt you will change, but you should at least pretend you've studied both sides of an argument. 

Also, you really show your ignorance with the statement: _ since ice records have shown that we have never had this amount of CO2 in our atmosphere, and we have never had a climate like this._ 

Right now, CO2 levels is about ~400ppm in the atmosphere. In Earth's past, it's been 1000ppm, 2000ppm, 4000ppm and even well above 5000ppm!!! That's 10x higher! For a baseline, keep in mind that most plants will die if levels fall below 150ppm. So, excuse me, but there is no CO2 crisis. 

It's been estimated that current oil reserves could well last over a century or more! There is no rush to find new forms of energy! Even so, I'm not against new energy, but it should be done voluntarily through the market.",0.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

""Slightly warmer temperatures"" means slightly warmer temperatures over the whole globe on average. When the earth was 2* cooler on average, North America was covered by a sheet of ice. So yes, it matters. Slightly warmer temperatures effect weather events significantly. Slightly warmer temperatures have already been causing the ice caps to melt, sending millions upon millons of gallons of water into our oceans, flooding places like Miami. The argument of ""Oh this is natural, it happens in a cycle"" is not a very good one, since ice records have shown that we have never had this amount of CO2 in our atmosphere, and we have never had a climate like this. Dismissing it as ""it's just a few degrees warmer"" is absurdly ignorant, and you should do more research on the subject. 

Regardless of whether or not the use of fossil fuel and coal are causing the climate problems we see today; we should be using cleaner, safer, cheaper energy, even if our irresponsible use of resources has nothing to do with our environment changing. We will run out of ""non-renewable"" resources soon, so we should seek out alternatives before we DO ""run out"". We should never be dependent on something so limited.

I definitely feel more empathetic towards him and his policies after reading it, I definitely recommend it

I'm not sure what you're getting at with NASA's budget being a testament to our environmental policies, and tbh I haven't really heard of pruitt's new policies. I only know that climate change was taken off government website, his former view on the EPA, his wasteful personal spending and taking all that land from the national park service, which I know is more trump but still... I think that finding the balance between regulations to protect the environment and profits was just thrown out of wack.

And I dont think our long standing relationships have been hurt by this, but it definitely had to potential to, and given that it seems like Trump would rather cozy up to Putin and Kim rather than Trudeau or Merkel I think we're kind of riding a thin line. And, let's be honest here, I dont know how you feel about trump, and I know I'm against pretty much anything he would do, and I try to take that into account when I judge him... but hes such a fucking idiot. Maybe not classically stupid, but atleast when it comes to common sense or socially, and I find it hard to believe that many of our allies dont see that as well and are more hesitant to work with us because of that... he likes to play hardball, and thats fine, but that's not a very good tactic in some cases, especially with North Korea, or China with trade, or our allies... if he wants to sit down with our allies and renegotiate deals or treaties or tariffs or whatever it sit down with Kim or Putin to hash something out, then he has every right to do and he should do that... but his whole ""I'm just gonna do something if they dont like it, fuck them"" kind of mentality isnt the correct way forward, and it just shows how little he truly understands and how unwilling he is to listen to people that do understand it...

For instance his entire thing about trade deficits... I truly think he doesnt know all that money is in the private sector and it isnt just a piggy bank that other countries sit on. And it's the same story with Tariffs and that issuing them only hurts the middle class, as evidenced by today's news that China just issued 10% tariffs on us which the people are going to pay for...

I see your point with keeping it out of Europe's hands but it essentially was; it was in our own hands. And do you honestly think that if, just hypothetically, if they said ""we're allocating a portion of the climate fund to.. Kenya (idk) to build some solar plants"" we would have no say in that? And the alternative to not being in the accord isnt ""we'll do our own thing"" its ""we'll do nothing""... atleast from a federal government perspective and many states and companies have followed suit... that's where the issue comes from, atleast in my eyes and in regards to climate change. We had the EPA being ran by a EPA opponent who called for it to be disband, we have a president who's said the entire thing is a hoax created by the Chinese, a media group with a large following and voice echoing that and sowing doubt, and a country as a whole that's just sweeping it under the rug (at least from a representative standpoint) all in the name of ""less regulation"" and obstructionism to make more profits which 99.99% of people will never see or to get re-elected.

If we had exited the accords and created our own strategy to reduce emmisions, increase renewable energy or anything of the sort I wouldn't have nearly as much of an issue as I do, but that's not what happened and, I hate to be the classic liberal stereotype, but it's all because of greed and narrow-mindedness. 

The bit I was talking about in Fear was essentially we were in talks with south Korea about building a nuclear missile defense there, and trump was bitching about the costs to (I think) General Mattis and even after he explained to him the benefit of having a 7 second response time to a missile launch rather than a 17 minute one, he still wanted to stop the deal because of its costs and build it in Portland... that's the same short mindedness that's behind the wall, tax cuts, health care, and the accords... it's about far more than just the upfront cost of something, it's about how effective the thing is and how we can benefit from it... and since I'm sounding more and more like a liberal stereotype (which I promise I'm not) I'll try not to harp on him too much.

The US has never been one to take, and that has certainly led to some detriment in some cases. But as a whole we're a globalist centered nation if that makes sense... we've always helped other nations and we've always led the coalition if there was one. And backing out of such a comprehensive initiative just shits in the face of that... I understand what Trump is doing/trying to do and I think he's right in some respects. For instance I've always felt we spend far too much on international affairs, we shouldn't be the world's police, and in some cases we've been taken advantage of... but then again we have a unique place in the world. We are by far the largest 1st world country by population and economy. we have by FAR the largest military so while I dont think we should be policing the world, we do have somewhat of an obligation to do just that simply because we're the only ones with the capability and I do applaud our allies for doing what they have done and standing by us essentially without question. And that's another point; our allies... they're incredibly important to us, not necessarily from a monetary POV or in hard numbers but when it comes to intelligence agencies from the likes of Germany or the UK, or immigrants from the EU as a whole, south Africa, or Taiwan which allows us to still be the top innovators of the world with schools that are lucky to be in the top 30. We rely on them for defensive capabilities, South Korea or Japan for instance and I could go on... and I may have gone on a bit of a tangent but all of that stuff is connected. We give a little;we get a little and that, at its heart, is American foreign policy in my opinion... and I know ""globalist"" has negative connotations for some reason but I feel that's what we are, maybe there's a different term for it though, idk, but that's what Trump is trying to destroy because I dont think hes looking at the big picture, and pulling out of the climate accords was the start of that. And I understand why he did it... I really do, but I just feel the reasoning for that is flawed and can have untold consequences down the line.

However, in no way do the researchers consider this good news. The study also finds that there are 46 percent fewer trees on Earth than there were before humans started the lengthy, but recently accelerating, process of deforestation.

""We can now say that there's less trees than at any point in human civilization,"" says Thomas Crowther, a postdoctoral researcher at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies who is the lead author on the research. ""Since the spread of human influence, we've reduced the number almost by half, which is an astronomical thing.""

In fact, the paper estimates that humans and other causes, such as wildfires and pest outbreaks, are responsible for the loss of 15.3 billion trees each year ‚Äî although the authors said at a press conference that perhaps 5 billion of those may grow back each year, so the net loss is more like 10 billion annually.‚Äù",1.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

What actually will determine the global climate is the density and pressure of the gasses and energy output of the sun and interstellar radiation that causes cloud formation at times. You can determine what the possible temperature of a planets atmosphere will typically be from the pressure and density of gasses that are present to hold heat. Earth is something like 17psi at ground level and equations that prove to correctly predict surface temperatures using this data are real and work for Mars and Venus.  

Even if Earth entire atmosphere was CO2  it would not have much of an impact as the only so many molecules are available at the earths gas density and the rock and oceans would still absorb and emit the same amounts of heat as they do now. Gas is thin and not able to hold much of the heat the earth holds and it doesn't hold that heat very long after dark where it is radiated out into space and only kept warm by the rock and water radiating heat through the night to keep the gas temperatures from having extreme day to night temperature variability.

Last month had 100 units of rainfall, this month had 95 units, what was the percentage reduction? Are you seriously saying you can't answer this question unless I specify whether rainfall is in mm or inches?
The whole idea behind a percentage is that the units don't matter.
I don't say ""My car is 30% less horsepower powerful than yours"". It doesn't matter if it's kilowatts, horsepower or catpower, it's 30% less. 

Some grade 8 math below for your perusal. It is crucial that you know high school maths (and hopefully a bit more) before you can be taken seriously on this topic.
Any ratio scale (with a true zero value and a linear progression) can have a percentage difference measured. Rainfall in any unit is a ratio scale. Temperature is one in kelvin or rankine (so literally choose any unit where it's possible to take a percentage and the answer you get will be the same every... single... time).

If I say someone in particular can tell me within a few percentage points the weather in a particular area for a month a few years in advance. Is that the same as saying that the scientific community can only predict climate for an entire decade within a few percentage points?

Of course it isn't, but somehow you drew that conclusion.

OK, try to finish the fill in the blanks in the logic below.
An individual can predict with little accuracy the weather in a specific area at a specific time.
An individual can predict with good accuracy the weather in a specific area over a month.
A group of scientists can predict with ____ accuracy the climate over the whole world over a decade.

If the accuracy improves from being terrible to being within a few percentage points for an individual making a prediction over a day vs over a month, then you would expect much higher accuracy over a longer period with scientific instruments and supercomputers and such.
I really thought I wouldn't have to spell this out so blatantly.

Instead of trying to predict the climate decades from now, which they can't do to the precision that they give with models, they should be estimating climate ranges that they think are optimal or not optimal without trying to fit them to ""trends"" so much.

The only places where CO2 is going to affect greenery is where CO2 is a limiting nutrient. That's the only time where increasing CO2 concentrations would increase vegetation. And CO2 does have a proven warming effect, like its had over Earth's geological history.

What are you rambling on about. Since when did ""cosmic rays"" effect climate in recent history? And the sun is an important component of Earth's climate, unless you realize that the recent warming Earth doesn't correlate to the sun's cycles:

Since John is a faithful supporter of Trump, it's of course not surprising that he provides a shallow, false view of the Paris Agreement.

Measuring the positive impacts of the Paris Agreement is too complex for this channel. It is by now a central document for international climate governance, and is integrated in many multilateral processes. It is true that the initial pledges were not at all in line with the temperature goals - but those pledges were just that, initial. What John did not include is the ratchet mechanism central to the Paris Agreement, where the pledges must be enhanced every five years - the next deadline being the end of this year, 2020. The covid-19 crisis will obviously have an impact, unfortunately a negative one probably, but we would still likely see some increase in ambition.

That being said, of course, the agreement should ideally have been much stronger, containing binding targets for example. That is however not possible in an international political system in which there is no government, and where compromises have to be made. Binding targets would not have been agreed by many countries - including the US. 

The US pulling out of the agreement was indeed a very bad decision for the climate. 

To conclude, I of course hope that Americans understand the long-term implications of climate change, also for their own country and economy, and prioritize that in their voting in November. The United States is such a great country, with so much innovation and political power. Speaking from an EU perspective, we long for the day where we can once again be allies, so that together we can push emerging economies like China towards true climate action instead of being locked in to fossil fuels.",0.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

The population of successor Soviet states has declined significantly since the illegal dissolution of the USSR in 1991, you moron. Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus in particular, all have lower populations than they did in 1991. The GDP of Ukraine is 70% of what it was in 1990.

Do you really think I'm stupid enough to buy your horseshit claim that times under socialism have caused more deaths than under capitalism? If the USSR still existed today, it would have a population of nearly 350 million people as it was growing by 2 million a year until 1991 when it reached a peak of 293 million people.

According to your asinine and dubious logic, tens of millions of people have died since the dismantling of socialism and replacing it in 1991 with capitalism, with an additional 50 million dead because these individuals were never added to the population since they were never born--which would have not happened if the USSR continued to exist to this day with its population growth rate.

The PRC is facing demographic issues thanks to idiotic neoliberals like Deng that implemented the One Child Policy after gaining power when Mao died in 1976. It's estimated a maximum of 3 million died in the Great Leap Forward due to nutritional deficiencies caused by the famine, or 15 million at worst.

If you read my comment again you will see that I am questioning the actual data. Nobody is alleging a grand conspiracy but you. 
By manipulating the raw data to fit the latest vogue model, which is a cardinal sin in science, a few people can have a malign effect on most of the world's population - however well intentioned they think they are being. Take a look at the 'evolution' of the climate data from NASA where you will find that the further back in report date you go, you will find the same year getting warmer. In other words, as time passes, the years before 1990 have magically become colder thus demonstrating a greater 'rise' in global temperature since. In other cases, historical temperatures have been extrapolated for an entire continent from _just one thermometer._",1.0,1.0,,cVkAsPizAbU,

Yes, I have heard of temp stations located near or on concrete that are used by the various agencies to measure global temperatures. One more reason to question the accuracy of the hysterical claims made by the GW pushers. They can only get the local weather reports right about half the time(five days in advance), and yet they expect us to believe they know what it will be like 50 years in advance.

 It is food growing and forcing food growers to small numbers only. Many people just forgotten how to grow food. New techniques without fossil fuels information to create abundant food is accelerating. The reality we have abundant food growing capability and are able to accelerate it. The problem is governments have put barriers in the way. They have created laws and policies that heavily effect costs of growing food that benefits large growers and the companies that process the food have centralized it and therefore control it. A lot of food is wasted everyday.
