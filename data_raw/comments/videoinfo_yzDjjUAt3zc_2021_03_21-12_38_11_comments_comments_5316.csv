I don't think people will give them up without a fight. People won't put up with a $40.00 a gallon tax on fuel. There is so much about climate we don't understand. But we will all die, well whatever... I won't worry about it. I won't wait for a bus when I have a car. Except for my daily commute because downtown parking is too expensive. But using public transit to get around outside rush hour, to do errands. No. And Catastrophe is always ~30 years away unless we drastically cut emissions within ~10 years. I am in New York now. And SUVs are everywhere. We aren't getting rid of fossil fuels anytime soon. Look at what happens when the tax on fuel (and heat) gets too high. Revolts, like in France. I know it wasn't the only factor. You want to believe people will buy expensive EVs. Or that batteries can store enough energy for industrial economies, be my guest. But what 300x the annual production of batteries would be required to keep up with Germany's energy needs for one week of no wind. They are only about 1% of Earth's population. And batteries lose their effectiveness over time. I am tired of people trying to chip away at our freedom, to ""Save the planet."" Yes I agree that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. But what effect will restricting industry do. If the oil comes out of the ground it will be sold, and burnt. And ridiculous solutions like biomass and biofuel. The lumber industry must think we are stupid if they believe we think burning wood is carbon neutral... Yep destroy wilderness to plant fast growing trees. Destroy rainforests to plant palm trees. NO that is not a solution. Hasty decisions are often bad decisions. Maybe you can afford an EV, but I can't. Are you trying to ban my little car? Or tax me out of my car? And how efficient is a diesel bus anyway? So often the run with 2-3 passengers. We need cheap energy to thrive. If we tax too much industry will move to lower tax jurisdictions. If all countries adopt a tax, industry will move where taxes can be avoided by paying bribes. There is no solution every year, except during recessions, consumption goes up. What do you think the IPCC will say in 2040? I know, ""It's worse than we thought, unless we drastically cut emissions within ~10 years we face certain climate catastrophe within ~30 years.""

BUT coal power stations turn over at night producing excess energy so when electric cars charge at night the pollution is being made anyway, wasted while doing nothing. 28–40% of electric car owners have solar panel and far more are planing to install them. This also doesn't take into account the increasing uptake of RE. Next gen electric cars also will have the ability to output into the grid, reducing demand spikes at peak times and thus less emissions again. Over the life of the car, using current grid mix, they still produce less emissions than ICE do. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwMPFDqyfrA&t=638s Make sure your green solutions aren't just green on the surface.THEY ARE GREEN ALL OVER, rather than covered in soot. ""YOUR conclusion is ALWAYS the same:"" Science is wrong lalalala I can't hear you Lalala lalala only god can change the climate....but but but Al Gore.

And if it was, just because the physics, research, science and observation say so it JUST CAN'T it just can't be CO2. ""What caused the 3000 year long roman warm period?"" YOUR IMAGINATION. There was a ""slightly"" shorter northern hemisphere warming period. This was a time of fluctuating temperatures and had periods of both warming and cooling. ""The Roman Warm Period, or Roman Climatic Optimum, has been proposed as a period of unusually warm weather in Europe and the North Atlantic that ran from approximately 250 BC to AD 400."" Which ""suggests that southern Aegean mean SUMMER temperatures in the 4th and 5th centuries BC were WITHIN a degree of modern temperatures."" ie cooler by a degree. I was due, not surprisingly, to changes in solar and volcanic activity. Today, in the northern hemisphere, the end of fall occurs when we are closest to the sun, meaning milder winters. 2500 years ago, closest approach occurred in the middle of fall, meaning an elongated warm season. The reasons then are not the reasons now. Solar has been decreasing since the late 1950's while temperatures go in the opposite direction.

Only in recent years has China surpassed USA in yearly emission rate, and even then the per capita emissions for China are lower due to their substantially larger population. The atmosphere's thermal balance only cares about total amount of heat-trapping gases, total contribution. Furthermore, if one takes into account a good chunk of China's manufacturing sector emissions are based on exports for USA consumption, then China just recently surpassing USA is even less significant. Take into account manufacturing exports and the USA's yearly emissions would be substantially higher than China's. Furthermore, the Chinese have substantially more R&D money going into GHG sequestration and reduction than USA Energy Dept. They are taking steps in some ways already where the Paris Accord has their obligations delayed somewhat. The EU is in much the same situation relative to the USA, doing more despite having a smaller per-person contribution to the problem. Try as you might to escape responsibility, the facts show that on a per-person basis a USA citizen has had far more contribution to the problem than a Chinese citizen. The Paris Accord is fair, and in fact generous to the USA. That being said, the framers of the Paris Accord might have figured on anticipating a selfish backlash from high emission nations and planned on a same-time start date for all countries, but with differing percentage contributions.

Layback Studios and TheCatLord, there was a lot of careful planning and negotiation into the Paris Accord. It was based on the assumption that it is fair for the major causes of the problem to take on a bit of the earlier share. The USA is by a good margin the largest historical emitter, both per capita and the country as a whole. The agreement was fair, and in fact even generous to the USA in some respects given our country's primary role in the existing greenhouse gases. One could argue that nobody knowingly wanted to change the atmosphere in this way, but consequences are consequences. No amount of selfish economic interest posturing will change that especially when our country is most easily poised to make the biggest difference early on.

The people, plants, and animals have had less than 300 years to try and adjust to the rapid rise of the global temperature. Millions of creatures and plants have died, been cut down, or burned for human gains. All of the carbon, CO2, methane, and other gasses have been released from plants when they are cut down or burned, these gasses go into the atmosphere and raise the global temperature. There is so much land that is being turned into deserts because of the rising temperatures. There is only so much that I can put into a YouTube comment about this major issue.

The Gov cant really do much as they have their hands tied by corrupt individuals.<br />Governments act like the HR of big business world wide.<br /><br />When change happens it will be implemented by the big corps via the government. <br />Money will be made from global warming.<br />That does not mean it will be left to spiral out of control. <br /><br />The most important thing in life will be and will always be to keep the world economy going and for you to be part of that.<br />Not tackling or adapting to global warming would eventually lead to anarchy and to the collapse of the world wide economy. <br /><br />The rich and powerful are where they are because of the economy. They will never jeopardise their positions.They will do all they can to keep the system going that keeps them on top. <br /><br />Our lives might not be great in the future in the sense quality of life might go down and the earth maybe some what bland and desolate<br />But I can guarantee you humans will be alive working and most likely having to pay for clean air to breath. <br /><br />Rule of thumb <br /><br />Money is their bible greed is their religion.,UCj_tzsJxNoYgamg6APu69aQ,0,Ugymmr6zfqF_ark-rqt4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

I believe we are to think Dems are on the right side of this given the videos presented here, they are not. Nancy Pelosi deserves a fair bit of blame as well. In response to AOCs sit in for climate change attention, Pelosis response was to place Joe Manchin the guy whose campaign had had him shooting a stack of papers labeled &#39;carbon tax bill&#39; with a gun, as a leader on the energy subcommittee instead of say AOC or really almost any other Democrat . This appears to be retaliation for humiliation done by AOC in pointing out Pelosis record of taking money from the same special interests as newt Gingrich, Boehner, Ryan, and every other modern house speaker. Furthermore, the Paris Climate agreement was largely symbolic and Obama knew that, it never had teeth and the scientists said up front it wasn&#39;t even close to addressing the scope of the problem when you actually examine the proposals. My point is, the democrats, at least the mainstream neoliberal variety and almost just as guilty here. In some ways they are worse because symbolically they represent the opposite of what their policies detail. Why? They&#39;re just as bought as John McCain who within a few years does a 180 degree turn on his climate positions as shown in this video.

They are normal events that happen throughout Earth&#39;s history. The main issue is the speed of Global Warming. The ecosystems of planet Earth are not accustomed for a quick change in temperature rather a gradual one (we are talking thousands of years). However, Earth has it&#39;s own mechanisms to reduce CO2 in the environment. This is increase in it&#39;s cooling like hurricanes and storms, ocean absorption but they can do so much until they are ineffective. Another is due to Orbital positioning and Solar Minimum (Solar maximum would basically cause hotter temperatures). Last time I checked we were still in a Solar Minimum. Spring is when most of Earth&#39;s CO2 dissipates from the air. Which helps a lot in diminishing CO2 concentrations. The main problem is gases like methane and other high carbon chain gases. Though they dissipate fast, they cause heavy damage. This is where we should tackle the problem first.",UC0czClF30tik9fSwyFuGzkQ,0,UgyiEfBCmTRZ-0E7n4N4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

The IPCC has been wrong in all their prognosticatians from the beginning and yet somehow they seem to keep on putting out chicken little stories. Do some reading. There are many scientists who do not agree with the IPCC and there is no 97% consensus about global warming. BTW &quot;consensus&quot; is anti scientific as science is never settled by voting or group think. Look at some of Tony Heller&#39;s videos. The data shows that there has been no warming of earth atmosphere as documented by the use of satellite data since 1998 and no increase in surface temperature for 15 years. Do not be duped by these charlatans. The earth had been warming for past 200 years but this is a normal variation and in fact is beneficial to life. Cold kills more than heat. Carbon Dioxide is beneficial and essential to all life on earth. In fact we are carbon based organisms and every carbon atom in our bodies was at one time contained in a carbon dioxide molecule before it was captured by a plant and converted to a carbohydrate through photosynthesis. Look at the carbon cycle. Its a continuous loop. Even if we stopped burning all fossil fuels there would be no measurable effect on global temperatures. This is a fools errand.

In other words, not only does he know how to spin a lie as the truth, but he teaches it. The *falsehood* here is that they claim people are trying to say that ghg's effect does not exist. Yes, it does exist or we would not be alive. No one doubt that's. What has not been proven is the sensitivity of the atmosphere to co2 changes. Let me ATTEMPT to explain it. By itself, with nothing else, co2 can rise the temperature about 1°C to 2°c in AN ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENT. Add water vapor, or as they do in many cases, ice, and you can easily caused the ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENT to get 3° or even 5° warmer. BUT the atmosphere is not an enclosed environment. In order to get from the 1° to 8°c they have to add multiple POSITIVE feedbacks, and totally ignore the NEGATIVE feedbacks of the atmosphere. Lets look at one of them: clouds. If clouds form low, they are highly reflective of sunlight. This causes MORE sunlight to be reflected back into space. In addition, low level clouds are more TRANSPARENT to infrared. So the more of energy that earth radiates is lost to space. High level clouds are the reverse. They ABSORB more sunlight, warming the atmosphere. They are also more REFLECTIVE of infrared. That is why on a cloudy day, with high clouds, its warmer at night. They reflect the infrared the earth radiates back to the earth. The early computer models had ever cloud high level. Even today they will admit they do not know how to model the clouds. Another negative feedback the alarmist refuse to even consider is that co2 radiates energy into space. Every model they use shows the infrared leaving the planet being reduced as co2 goes up. Satellites from the 1990's prove the reverse. Increasing co2 means increasing infrared leaving the planet. This is a negative feedback NOT ONE of the models consider. ""for your very first claim"" The *falsehood* here is that I did not use greenhouse data. I used satellite data.

Here you go: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11362 WARNING: What you'll read in the opening three paragraphs is truth mixed with nonsense, because while the Director of the Earth Science Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center does indeed admit that pre-industrial times show CO2 lagging the heating of the planet, he does not explain why the planet would have heated in the first place during these pre-industrial times when CO2 started out low and then climbed along with the temperature increase. Think about it... If he did tell you why the Earth got warmer during those times without a preceing increase in CO2, you might just ask yourself if that same factor might be heating the Earth now as well, and that certainly wouldn't have served his purpose now would it? The answer? Whether or not you buy into CO2 acting as a substantial greenhouse gas, we can all agree that when it comes down to it, it is the SUN that heats our planet. Unfortunately, what the scientists fail to tell the Global Warming/Climate Change believers is that when the sun throws off more solar winds, it blocks cosmic rays, which all scientists know are integral to the Earth's formation of clouds. Less clouds = more heat reaching the Earth = increased temperatures. Bottom line? Human production of CO2 is a tiny part of all CO2 released and is negligible when compared to CO2 released from volcanos and the natural degredation of plant particles. The bad news is that we can't turn down the sun or alter its processes. The good news is that during Medieval Times, the Medieval Warm Period brought 300 years of added wealth and prosperity that actually resulted in a doubling of the world's population, so even if the sun doe bump up the overal temperature by a few degrees, it's going to be a boon, not a bust for the people of the Earth.",UCH5QdaEWA4vtua1K3gZCmWA,1,UgzvtcZGgPCGOsJ2vUx4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

What is your country doing? I was wondering how many people in this thread actually read the IPCC report? As in the report, not it being reported on on your favourite channel. How many people are able to explain what terms such as ""albedo"", ""radiative forcing"" mean or which gases make up the greenhouse blanket? I made sure I know something before starting criticising people. The arrogance with which climate change knowledge is denied, particularly when it comes to expertise of people who devoted their entire lives to it is stunning. How's Miami doing these days?

You can most certainly bet your last dollar on that...but just as any species (including and especially humans) Had to live accordingly to weather climates and water levels. They had to move. They had to migrate. It’s unfortunate and inconvenient thing to have to resort to...but don’t you believe it’s a little bit arrogant to complain about what nature is doing? As if...how dare Mother Nature change on us like this. We don’t manipulate that. If water levels are rising, either you cope with it or you get out of dodge. You don’t get to make that decision. Mother Nature makes it for you. It’s arrogant to think that we can dictate what is suppose to happen. Earthquakes happen. Lives are lost. Hurricanes happen...lives are lost. Sink holes happen...lives are lost. It’s inevitable and it always will be. It comes with the territory of living and being on planet earth.

It doesn't have to be. Global climate as said should not be moving st the pace it is now. Yes, you may live in a place were the winter climate falls into the negatives but because it is reaching such tempuratures it's probably either not on the ocean or very far north. The places having the largest climate impact are those on the ocean in moderate or high climates. They are seeing heat records being broken time over time and it seems like the next year it's gonna be hotter. And the ocean is even worse. It is estimated that if all the ice were to melt, it could happen by 2070 at most and would plunge all of our beaches 50 metres under water. And the more heat in the ocean the worse hurricanes there will be, and the more that will occur which will cause many billions and trilions of dollars of damage. 50 metres under water? Tens and maybe hundreds of trillions in damage and over two billion people will be homeless. Think about how many refugees that is. And world wide famine would occur because our most common crops cannot handle climate change. Not much and definantly not enough. There will soon be vast oceans of desert climate as aritable land recedes further north. Does this sound nice to you? Is this worth the few billions of dollars we could have spent today?

The laws of thermodynamics will show anyone that fossil fuels are, by far, the best source for energy bc of its yield for the amount of effort put in. I applaud the clean energy efforts...I truly do. Plus we would all LOVE to not have to pay big energy bills...but the jobs it provides, the benefits, the margins are far too valuable to give up or kick down and beat up.

They hear something that sounds logical and legitimate and bc it comes from a “reputable source”, it must be true, right?

The U.S. could double our emissions and still not even begin to scratch the surface on how much China pollutes and we can’t control their actions...and that’s the tip of the iceberg. Natural occurrences such as volcanoes produce far more emissions than all humanity can conjure up in several generations. People need to reconsider what their being fed and just try to open their mind to this “global warming” stuff actually being nonsense.

Once released, there is one chance in 41,253 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 71% of the Earth&#39;s surface, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate a body of water&#39;s surface, but will instead excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas which prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon. Consequently, the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 40% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity. The present increase in temperature due to this combination of additional H2O and CO2 in the atmosphere is approximately .9C at present.

At the time, this did not make sense, since no one was proposing more than spending a few billions to finance things to remove co2. Because they limited it to only those that believed age, 96% said yes. Then the Paris accord came out and the US alone was suppose to spend 3 BILLION dollars a year to support UN programs for global warming AND the UN had the right, according to the agreement, to demand more. This was ON TOP of the US spending many more billions on green energy, something many people do not realize. They think it was ONLY the 6 billion and most do not even realize it was only for the first 2 years. Then AOC, announced the new green deal and quoted that poll saying that all scientist believe we should do everything in our power to stop agw. So NOW we know what ""no matter the cost"" means. It means the destruction of the American way of life. ""I find this tremendously curious when the vast majority of climate scientists"" The fact is, the vast majority of climate scientist do not support agw. ONLY those that are accepted by the climate mafia are counted as climate scientist when they do the poll. Their limiting factor was to be published in a magazine that was controlled by the climate mafia, so of course those that were counted in that survey did support. BUT if you ask the people that are trained as scientist by an accredited university or college, and have worked as a scientist in the field, you find those that agree are in the minority. The majority 54% say there is no danger from co2. 22% say we should do everything no matter what the cost, to stop it. The rest say either we should do something, or they don't know. ""The scientific method! "" Do you have any idea what the scientific method is? 1) You use the same method of measurement from beginning to end. Agw refuses to do so. Since they do not have instrument readings from more than 200 years ago, and only have good measurements since the advent of satellites THAT is as far back as those readings can be used. Since they need to prove that the last 200 years are unusual, they have to use proxies. IF you use proxies all the way to the end, we have not had unusual climates. There are indications that specific years of the 1000 years ago was  higher than the instruments readings of recent years, but it can not be proven. 2) In proper scientific procedure you have to show EVERYTHING you do. People like Michael Mann still hide their data. EVEN NASA, refuses to show how they adjust their data. 3). When  you are publish data, you are suppose to be reviewed by your scientific peers. Climatologist say that no one else can possibly understand because their field covers a lot of area, but that is just a way to limit the number of people that can review their work.4) Agw is a theory. If a theory is shown to have holes in it, in proper scientific standards, it would be withdrawn and reworked to include all the new data, or dismissed. AGW proponents REFUSE to do so. They double down and demand that their theory be totally disproven or accepted as a law. Sceptics are not suppose to have to disprove it, only to show the holes. ""Fermi Paradox"" Well, I wasn't going to point out the similarities between people that believed in agw and those that believe aliens walk among us, but....:) The reality is, alarmist insist on ignoring all the evidence to the contrary, and demand their theory be accepted as law, despite the fact is has such huge holes.",UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g,1,UgzFfBfl3F9ttv_kP_J4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Notice how the end, the proxy data goes down. That called ""hiding the decline"" Its bad science and that is what its all about. I am not a climate denier. I say climate is always changing. YOU are a science denier. YOU insist that we ignore real science. Things like Dendrochronology which tells you that what they did with the graphs are impossible. Things like glaciology that shows that the glaciers started melting before co2 went up. Things like oceanography that says reefs are recovering after ships were blocked from being too close and people were banned from walking on them. Things like marine biology that says shellfish were dying long before co2 went up due to fertilizer and sewage. I do not believe in agw. I do not disbelieve in agw. Science does not care if you believe or not. RELIGION requires belief. It requires that you take a leap of faith. That you take what they tell you as truth and never look for it. ""If nothing is done now"" You mean like the New Green Deal, which would take away our rights to decide where to live. They want to destroy our homes so they can build super efficient housing, i.e. slave pens. I have seen the designs for things like that. A single person would have a home that was 10 by 5 to live in and would have to use a restroom down the hall. Anything bigger than that would be too inefficient and would take too much energy. They would decide if and when you could have children, or even marry, or if you had to a marry someone of your own sex to keep it balanced. They would decide if you could have meat or if you were a vegetarian, because cow farts are bad for the environment. They would decide everything for you. That is what they are proposing. All to stop co2 from rising and stopping the temperature from gaining .3°C. IF you were to take America out of the equation, all our co2 and everything, it would stop the co2 rising .3°c in 100 years and that is more than they expect. ""Im scared for myself "" That is what it is all about. FEAR. Its all they have. Science does not support agw. History does not support agw. All they have is models that are constantly wrong.

One written by a retired Highschool science teacher who was probably spending his career teaching from narrow minded selective and out dated text books which we know today much of the information in those books are incomplete, outdated or in some cases flat wrong and probably gets all his new science info from sources like FOX news. First off samples from tree rings from a particular area and age should display all the same data as any other tree in that area at about the same age. SO scientist selecting only 12 cores out of 47 because only those 12 showed the data they were ""looking for"" Is simply impossible. Now its possible that different tree cores from different regions and species of tree may show different results because different regions experience different climates. The second graph was titled at 150 year span but the data on the image only shows 99 years so credibility of this source material is dwindling fast. The Hockey stick debate source was written by the Department of economics and one could easily see why that department doesn't support the climate report. Willis Eschenbach is one of a select few ""climate scientists"" Actively sewing seeds of doubt on human driven climate change claiming that the vast majority of scientists are purposely falsifying observational data and claiming to run the experiments but never coming up with the same data. I find this tremendously curious when the vast majority of climate scientists have continued to publish there findings and data sources/ experiments and theories while other private investigators reviewed that same data and came to the same conclusions. Willis Eschenbach claims that none of the data holds while the vast majority are in complete agreement on the data. This to me shows that he specifically has vested interest in halting the type of progress we need to combat this very real issue. Climate deniers such as yourself have an air about them that says I dont even want to consider this as something even close to the realm of possibilities because its scary and the scale of the problem is so large that you will find any piece of information that validates and supports your belief or maybe disbelief in this case. Then you shout it out at the top of your lungs whenever someone brings up the subject. Oh but not before covering your eyes and ears to any info they may be trying to reach you with. Sounds like a perfect Trump supporter to me. TBH Im scared for you, Im scared for myself but I feel immensely sorry for the next few generations of people who get to struggle in the wasteland legacy of a planet in the name of profit, engineering & political biased. If nothing is done now to build a newer and better system across the board and we just go about business as usual we wont just be facing drastically changing environments but instead facing the real possibility of Human extinction. The planet will still be here though and probably simple life forms. Probably for the best I guess. With all the potential humanity has at its disposal and all the intelligence we love to flaunt in reality we are just smart enough to be suicidaly stupid. Especially people like you who refuse to believe the masters of the greatest tool to understand the world and universe around us. The scientific method! To deny science is to deny reality. Its people who stand in the way of positive progress or posses egos so large they ignore reality all together who just might prove the Fermi Paradox. This could very well be our great filter. Are you just gonna take eternity though blind faith or will you wake TF up and look the danger in the face and recognize it before its way way way to late?

""Sure a past extinction event could have been caused, and likely was caused, by global warming that made the Earth much hotter than it is today."" So where is the evidence of it? At no point is there any evidence that global warming caused an extinction. There has been 5 great extinction event, all of them blamed by alarmist on co2. 1 just happen to coincide with the earth being stuck by an asteroid that burned off a large portion of the worlds trees. Alarmist point out the sudden increase in co2 and say that was what killed the animals, but ignore the fact that it was briefly exceedingly hot and then suddenly cold for a long time. They ignore the fact that o2 dropped drastically. A second was blamed on the co2 put out by a volcano that erupted for over a million years, but they ignore the fact that the point that the life died was a relatively small period where o2 dropped drastically and methane skyrocketed, due to that volcano briefly emitting a lot of nickel that fed a microbe that created methane out of co2, water and o2. The oxygen dropped below the level that most of the animals needed to survive, but the alarmist do not consider this a reason for the die off. This pattern follows for the other three events. Alarmist blame it on co2, but ignore other causes. For instance the break up of Pangea caused a lot of environments to drastically change rapidly, killing off animals that evolved in those environments. YET alarmist blame it on the co2 increase. ""The change we are seeing now is orders of magnitude faster than anything in the past, "" Thousands of years ago, it warmed 5° in only a couple centuries. It did not cause an extinction level event. In fact life bloomed after it. How is the .9°C a drastic enough change to risk anything. ""we would still have Earth continuing to warm for hundreds if not thousands of years based on the past 150 years of emissions alone."" That flies in the face of history facts. At no point does an increase in co2 last long in history and there is no point where an animal like humans have caused an increase to determine that. The biggest problem is that the model all depend on high atmospheric sensitivity to create these false hoods and history shows the sensitivity is low. ""I'm sure you've seen the chart of the warmest decade on record being the past 10 years;"" The assumption here is that just because its warmer, it has to be caused by co2.

By getting people like you to push for a carbon tax on fossil fuels with a carbon credit that can be sold to offset the tax. IF that is pass nation wide, then they can produce algae fuel, which removes co2 from the air and they can then undercut the oil producing countries and or simply tell them to take a hike. Once their equipment fails from non use, they can raise their prices to any extreme they want.

The problem is not ""that the climate is changing"", the problem is the RATE at which we see the climate changing. Sure a past extinction event could have been caused, and likely was caused, by global warming that made the Earth much hotter than it is today. But that change ramped up over a period of hundreds of thousands of years, a very quick change on the geologic time scale. The change we are seeing now is orders of magnitude faster than anything in the past, which means it's likely to cause an avalanche effect with all the positive feedback for a warming Earth once it starts, which it has. It's a classic example of an under damped system with positive feedback, in other words if we stopped ALL C02 emissions TODAY, we would still have Earth continuing to warm for hundreds if not thousands of years based on the past 150 years of emissions alone.

All we have to do is pump sulfur into the atmosphere. It sounds crazy, but when you put sulfur into gas form, its got the ideal density for the ozone layer. All you need to do is find the hole, get a massive tube, tie a weather balloon to it, and start pumping sulfur. And we have enough sulfur to do it too. Sulfur gas is the primary gas waste that comes out of mining, and the amount of sulfur Canada and America alone pumps out is more than enough. It’s really that easy. Just a year or two to make sure sulfur doesn’t have a destructive reaction to the ozone layer’s gases, and that’s it. <br /><br />Now why isn’t anyone doing this? Ir’s Because artificially stabilizing a planet’s atmosphere is the first step to artificially engineering our planet. And people can’t seem to figure out Thad you can only do so much damage to something before they can’t heal by themselves. When an organ fails, we replace it. When a person gets burned to the bone, you artificially insert new skin. When an action figure’s arm falls off, you don’t put them next to each other and hope they reconnect, you glue it back on!

Unless you move those two, the temperature can not climb more than 3°C hotter than it is now. That is because of the earths albedo. There is so much ice and snow on the planet that it is reflecting a large portion of the suns energy back into space. 3) when both of those areas froze, the co2 levels were at 1500 ppm. How can the co2 increasing from 350 to 410 cause them to melt? EVEN if as the scientist predict, the co2 goes to 750 by 2100, it will not be more than half of what the atmosphere  held when those froze.

The reason is there is more moisture in the air and that means more rain. More rain means more water for plants. More co2 means they can hold the water better. Greenhouses keeps their plants warmer to encourage them to grow, so your theory that hotter temperatures will cause them to die is wrong. 10000 years ago, the temperatures were hotter than they are now, and yet the Sahara was a garden, as was the American southwest deserts.

He is the one that said we would have cannibalism by 2005. ""When they talk about climate change causing droughts (maybe you were referring to that) they were pretty spot on."" Quite the contrary. IF anything they are fewer. https://goo.gl/images/3Yvhv8 here is england results. Here is the alarmist own view of it. show me where droughts are getting worse. https://goo.gl/images/nTuvgV Here is one from canada. Again, increasing temperature does not cause worse drought. http://pcag.uwinnipeg.ca/Prairie-Perspectives/PP-Vol02/mcginn-bryant.pdf The only reason that drought SEEM worse is the news reports them now as 100 years ago, if you heard about them it was months later. Even the Sahara desert is NOT getting worse. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2012/10/25/contrary-to-what-you-hear-global-warming-has-been-good-to-africa/#343985b427f6 Satellites have shown that it is greener in the last 30 years due to co2 increase. ""The past century has already seen drought severity increase in places like the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the eastern coast of Australia."" The increases in ""drought severity"" is in fact not due to increases in co2, but failure to take care of the land. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4OBcRHX1Bc The truth is, in an attempt to increase the food the land produces, people are getting rid of things like willow trees and preventing the water from standing on the land. The result is that the land dries out. Many places have channeled rivers or flood plains trying to make them carry more food. The result is the land doesnt have the water to grow the food. "" because who is they?"" James Hansen, the first IPCC, and groups like that. ""the coverage of ice in both artic and antartic were going to decrease significantly and in fact this is what is already happening. "" Quite the contrary. While ice is disappearing in the north, its increasing the same amount in the south. Its not disappearing, its moving from one pole to the other. I would love to have you show me the satellite graph of the ice in Antarctica disappearing. Several years ago, someone tried to do so, but as someone trained by the USAF, I immediately saw the lie of what they said. The NASA blog said it was disappearing, but the graph did not show what he said it did. The graph showed increases of 1-3 inches per year as light green, increases of more as dark green, and decreases in red similarly. There was a good bit more dark red than dark green, which is where they got their claim, BUT the dark red showing 3-10 inches of decrease were tiny compared to the area increase. Perhaps 2% of the map showed a decrease, while 90% showed an increase (about 5-7% showed no change) Even if the entirety of the decreasing area was the full 10 inches (not likely) and even if the 90% only had 1 inch (not likely), you still had more than snow falling each year than disappearing. After I pointed this out, the graph and the blog both disappeared from NASA site. I cant find any place that still has the graph. "" Miami saw an increase of sea levels equal to five inches and new york sea levels raised by 275% since 2000 (9 inches growth) and thats A LOT."" Water does not build up in one spot. It finds the same level. So why is New York and Miami seeing a lot more change instead? The answer is subsidence. https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/glacial-adjustment.html All the east coast (New York and Boston) are sinking as the magma beneath them moves towards Canada and Ohio, where the glaciers were 15000 year ago. Miami was built on top of a brimy aquifer. They could not drink it but they drained a swamp feeding it. Thus they emptied it and the land settled. It has caused an increase in subsidence of 3 mm a year. That is over half the increase they have seen in Miami. http://www.ces.fau.edu/arctic-florida/pdfs/fiaschi-wdowinski.pdf In addition, it has been know for over a century that there is an Atlantic oscillation. What this means is that there is a 60 year wave that goes back and forth across the Atlantic. For 30 year, one side will get an increase in sea level while the other side will see a decrease. For the last 20 years years the water has been moving west, so it shows an increase in New York and Miami. In 10 year, that will reverse and the water will move towards Europe and England. This increase is most of the last half of what Miami is seeing. This does not mean there is not an increase in sea level. World wide has seen an increase of about 6 inches over the last century. This is the result of glaciers melting. ""the IPCC reports because they NEVER wrote about the 97% consensus"" The very first one did. They removed it after it was proven that the person that wrote the report was NOT a tenured professor and someone that had worked in the field for 25 years as they claimed, but was in fact a 22 year old student in political science who flunked out because he deliberately lied about his report. ""because the study that was published was made by a team not a single person."" The first three reports were all done by single people. Only later ones were done by groups and that does not mean they were any better, considering that every one was from a course in political communication, what laymen call spin doctoring.",UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g,1,Ugy4868Wohwz29w8GCN4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

You said that scientists predicted by 2005 that there would be food riots and cannibalism...unfortunately, especially the cannibalist part, no scientist ever said that. When they talk about climate change causing droughts (maybe you were referring to that) they were pretty spot on... not even talking about all the terrible droughts in california or australia or africa especially, by looking at the datas the surface of the sahara desert increased by over a million square kilometers from 1970 to 2000. The past century has already seen drought severity increase in places like the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the eastern coast of Australia. So Its already happening. But referring to the 16% food productivity increase I literally searched everywhere and I found no evidence on that data because the only studies about the link between CO2 levels and food growth where all projections and not actual calculations. Its true that an increase of CO2 can increase vegetable growth but its just a very reductive point of view: you have to include the influence of water evaporization, of the higher number of floods and droughts and especially of the region you are taking in consideration. For example in tropical regions cause of higher temperatures the plants growth decrease by over 50% instead in a region like europe crops can increase their growth by 13%. On the other point it depends on what study or organization you were referring to.... you can’t just say “they said that polar ice caps were totally melting by 1995” because who is they? Not even today any scientific organization predicted that polar ice caps will be totally gone by 2020.... and also are you referring to just artic Ice pole? Or also antartica? Or both of them? And you are considering the entire year or only summer? You can believe everything you want but scientists predicted that the coverage of ice in both artic and antartic were going to decrease significantly and in fact this is what is already happening. Oh and the north pole is nearly ice free during summer there is a reason why russia and other countries are pushing to invest in that region because now they can. “They said that miami and new york would be flooded by 2005” again I didn’t find any report asserting that but Miami saw an increase of sea levels equal to five inches and new york sea levels raised by 275% since 2000 (9 inches growth) and thats A LOT. You just have to look on what is happening in many parts of miami where now is literally normal that they get flooded even when it doesn’t rain. And its also clear that you never read the IPCC reports because they NEVER wrote about the 97% consensus lol. They didn’t reported the study and they didn’t fund it. And I really don’t know who you are referring to when you talked about the 22 year old political science...also because the study that was published was made by a team not a single person. But if you really think that the ipcc is lying you should look up at their reports since the first one in 1990 because they predicted results that were pretty close on what really happened.",UCjqISNuJA3W6L4oJYpKC5Eg,1,Ugy4868Wohwz29w8GCN4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

When I was a kid, the area I grew up had several years where the winters got so cold we had to have snow days. Now, they dont have them any more. I was told this happen 60 years before, but they had not had to have them in decades. IF im being paid, I want to talk to someone, as I havent gotten any paychecks. What I have also been paying attention so is so many of their predictions are failing. They said by 2005, there would be food riots and people would be resorting to cannibalism because of the heat killing off the cattle and plants. Instead the increase in co2 has caused a 16% increase in food production. They originally said that the polar ice caps would melt by 1995, and when they didnt, they moved the goal post to 2005, then 2013, 2017, and now 2020. They said that Miami and New York would be flooded by 2005, yet 13 years later, they have barely lost any land to the sea. I have read the IPCC reports and its obvious that there are lots of lies. For instance, the 97% consensus was first reported by IPCC as being created by a tenured professor who had worked in the climate field for 27 year, but it turned out to have been written by a 22 year old POLITICAL SCIENCE student that flunked out of college. When that happened, several other POLITICAL science students and professors replicated his work using slightly more accurate results. Not one of them has ever been more than 10% accurate. They are all filed with 90% lies at least. If my ""betters"" come looking for me, they better bring plenty of weapons. As a USAF vet, I know a lot about warfare and as someone trained in non standard weapons and tactics, they better hope they know more about it than I do.

Pollution is due to our overconsumption, not to the economic system in place, knowing that non-capitalist economic systems doesn't mean that we won't overproduce stuff. Everything will change when all individuals, include you and I, will change the way we live. We need to buy less, but also to make choices that have smaller impacts on the environment (example: stop buying big 4x4 SUVs with big engines and buy smaller cars or stop wasting 1/4 of the food we buy). Then, since we're in a capitalist economy, the market will simply readapt itself to the new demands of consumers.

The proposed change also makes liable persons who conspired to engage in the prohibited conduct. This means a person who attended a meeting during which a peaceful protest was planned against construction of an oil and gas facility could also be prosecuted for committing a felony - the same grade of offense used to define capital murder.<br /> <br />Please OPPOSE this attack on the rights of Pennsylvanians to stand up for their clean air and clean water. This is an attempt to silence Pennsylvanians who oppose environmental degradation, the potential consequences of natural gas infrastructure, and the reckless behavior of the oil and gas industry.",UC5Uklar6xMo2oKQ_E___IUw,0,UgyvcWRDJiBTWCg542F4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

All over the world, temperatures are getting hotter, sea levels are getting higher, rain has been getting heavier. More and more natural disasters have been devastating our earth, and even those against climate change can&#39;t deny we are seeing these natural disasters not only more frequently, but more quickly too. <br /><br />If you don&#39;t trust numbers generated and/or agreed upon by 98% of the world&#39;s scientists, trust the anguished cries of those trapped by natural disasters. <br /><br />Trust the grief of those who have lost someone in a natural disasters, regardless of where it has happened. Trust the billions of dollars lost because we don&#39;t take a stand against emitting carbon dioxide gases that are warming our planet and making that one child in California lose all he or she knows on a devastating forest fire. Trust the exhaustion of so many rescue workers who have to see the same scene over and over again because we are too busy trying to denounce each other&#39;s political ideologies and bickering amongst ourselves to even CARE. <br /><br />People all around the world are TIRED of having to deal with their family members dying everyday.

I believe it started as a tactic to put themselves in the best position to win the next election. This is because after the bush administration they really found themselves in a world that was becoming more progressive and voters shifting to the left. This shift caused the Republican strategy to become hindering the president's ability to do anything to make the Democratic party less appealing to swing voters and ensure they can win the presidency in the next cycle (by cycle I mean 8 years as in recent elections more often than not president's served 2 concecutive terms unless they were really bad or did something really illegal). I theorise that this might be the reason why politics has become extremely divisive and polarised in the last decade. However when there was a sudden unexpected rise of populism cause by the positions the Republicans were taking (as more often than not party affiliation and tribalism shapes your beliefs) trump was elected by riding the wave of populism and hijacked the Republican party. Causing the Republicans ability to push once agendas that they would have done in the past but opposed for a time while Obama was in offfice (such as immigration reform and tackling climate change) and taking the whole party to the extreme.

Gradually replace coal-fired plants with nuclear and natural gas. The renewables like wind and solar are nice, but are auxiliary sources, not primary sources of energy. Actually, we could become the world&#39;s exporter of nuclear reactors and fuel, which could be a huge boon to the economy.<br />3.

The problem with solar and wind is that they pretty much are forced to run at 100% capacity due to how they operate (a windwills power output is dictated by the wind, not the operator, same with solar panels). This causes problems with scalability. If your wind farm has 10 mills, generates 50mW, and the power consumption increases to 52mW, you now have to construct a new mill. So now our farm has 11 mills, and 55mW of output, but only 52mW of consumption, so 3mW are being wasted. In the case of a traditional fission power plant (or any other power plant for that matter), the output can be adjusted by the operators. If my power plant has a maximum output of 100mW (at 100%), but the requirement is only 50mW, then the operators can limit output to 50% (50mW), no power is wasted in this case. If the requirement increases to 60mW, then the output limit can be adjusted to 60% (60mW). Again, no energy is lost, as energy output is controlled by the operator, not by natural forces. Because standard plants maximum capacity is typically significantly higher than the demand, they are able to easily react to increases in demand, without energy loss. Since output can be changed on the fly, as opposed to installing new panels or mills, the costs of increasing output are also much lower than standard renewables. Furthermore, since operations are centralized, maintenance is easier. This is the advantage of traditional power over renewables. Renewables are still useful. They provide very cheap power, and for areas with low power demands, such as suburban or rural areas, they are superior to standard plants. For large metropolitan areas or areas with heavy industry, power requirements are immense and fluctuate, so standard power plants are preferable in those cases. Now, let's not forget about Hydroelectric! Hydro actually has all the benefits of traditional plants without the drawbacks of other renewables. The only tradeoff is that construction and operation costs are staggering compared to other sources of energy. Now as for nuclear energy being non-renewable, I actually disagree. It's technically non-renewable, but it's about the most renewable non-renewable source of energy. Nuclear fuel can be reused and recycled quite a number of times before becoming totally useless. Disposal of spent fuel is non-trivial. Literally, just dig in a salt-rich mountain (ie somewhere out in the middle of Nevada), throw the fuel into the hole and forget about it. The salt provides radiation shielding, and desolate and arid climate will prevent potential leakages due to erosion. For the US, due to our massive power consumption, I propose that about 40% of generation be Nuclear, 30% be Hydroelectric, and the rest be Solar, Wind, and Geothermal. With this model, our energy sector would emit no carbon, and still provide huge amounts of energy. Some smaller nations, like in Europe, could get away with almost 90% being purely hydroelectric. Those nations have some very large rivers and generally, have smaller populations with lower power requirements.",UC4WlVvd9VnGtVBNG55xqqJA,1,UgzcqBo_urkAIG5Pylp4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Natural Gas is what a lot of environmentalists call a middle ground of some sorts. It's much cleaner and better chan coal or oil, but it still has a lot of environmental concerns. Natural Gas still causes emissions even if it is a lesser amount. Fracking is also believed to do a lot of local damage, notably to water supplies and leads to more earthquakes. Nucleur, Solar, Wind, etc. are much more environmental friendly. Most environmentalists dont have as big of an issue with nuclear energy. It's much more safe than what we do now, but thorium is not a renewable energy resource, while solar and wind energy are. Thats why many of us prefer to 'skip' nuclear and jump to renewable energy. And certain GMOs are not environmentally friendly. Specifically ones that have pesticides implemented, those seriously damage the local wildlife.

Which are basically all of the governments which have stalled and dragged there feet on the matter since the first conclusive evidence and case were made for global climate change back in the early 70s. Its been nearly 50 years we have known about this problem and the amount of study and evidence since then further proved not only that it is indeed happening but its far worse than we could have imagined. The green tech that we are finally starting to see take hold should have been here 20 years ago which would have considerably slowed the progression of green house gasses and the general efficiency of all tech would be better and cheaper & society would have had more time to adjust and avoid a collapse which at this point I believe is imminent and completely necessary to ensure the survival and continued progression of Humanity. I knew when I was a kid in Middle school learning world history studying the collapse of Rome and other empires through out history that our current civilization shares many parallels with but on meth with Nukes. The more I learn about the world and our universe the more convinced I am that we are quickly driving this train off the tracks and a collapse is almost entirely certain to occur probably within my life time even. SO yes I believe that these disillusioned super wealthy billionaires who stand in the way of climate progress should be killed and brutally at that, then to have there companies and assets either completely striped down or transformed to create the kinds of infrastructure we actually need to deal with this, at the very least to survive it. As to shooting smokers on sight you need to remember that they were tricked into a very real addiction with very real medical consequences promoted by one of these industries I have been mentioning. Wanna shoot someone on sight? Shoot the leaders of the Tobacco industry, Big farma, Oil, Coal and while your at it the idiots who built Fission Reactors near the coastlines that are almost certainly gonna be under water within the next century liable to melt down after years of no upkeep and will poison huge regions for thousands of years after. Not the best legacy to leave behind IMHO. I dispute shooting smokers on sight because I was addicted to tobacco for about 15 years. Thankfully I finally quite last year and have no intention to returning to that habit. Im 4 months from my official 1 year mark! ^_^ Dont just simply lash out in a semi general direction. Lash out with purpose at a well defined target.",UCd577ZI8QaMuZpg_M8n8sbA,1,Ugy8Hs-t_lBbK0TaMdV4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

I think its kinda obvious that the kind of denier being referred to are the ones who are actively trying to halt climate progress. Most of us are caught up in a system and life style that take the conscious choice for serious change away from us. People who deny that climate change is even a real thing are what I call enablers. The real and serious bad guys here are the dirty politicians who deregulate dirty industries and those industries who pay those politicians and lobbyists and bribed scholars who publish false papers to sew confusion and distrust of credible field scientists & actual experts. These are the people I would like to see drawn and quartered with each body part then collected and preserved to be put on display for the world to remember the greatest evil to ever walk with humanity. If you think Hitlers Genocide was pure evil this one is global and cross species. No one and nothing is safe. If the past 50 years has taught me anything its that the best and most likely scenario that doesn't involve the extinction of humanity is as follows. Our leaders are absolutely not going to do a damn thing about this problem. They will do a little then change there minds and revert back. This is the trend we see. Why because who actually owns our politics? The major corporations who have vested interest in keeping things exactly as they are. Why you ask? Because the #1 cause of all these problems is something nobody wants to touch with a 10 LY long pole. Population! Its understandable why nobody want to talk about that because we only have a few options available to control population and they are all pretty dark territory. War, genocide, famine, ecological disaster, limiting 1 living child per couple, sterilizing large portions of the current population. Or my personal favorite Amassing such wealth and technology that secret organizations build Arks and fill them with hand picked populations of a sustainable size while at the same time crippling the natural world to cause Intended eco-disasters to drastically cut population and bring down all the major empires we see today. Then they wait. Or perhapse they actually have viable tech and plans to reverse this process over time. I call it the amassed wealth and power society restart button. Kinda explains why it took so long for aid after Katrina right on the mainland of the USA. Also explains why little to nothing is being done about all the cancer causing products circulating in our market & why Universal health care will never be taken seriously. Why? Because they dont want us healthy and they dont want us smart to them we are a cattle work force but now with the emergence of automation robotics a large population for the purpose of labor is obsolete and so are we in the eyes of the mega wealthy.

What was brought up as Democratic/Republican has completely changed. Those are only titles for an idealogy and mindset. Even though it's true to lean to the left or the right is to have an conservative mindset or etc, the titles themselves are completely subjective to change (And DO change), because what they project and mean/ etc will always be present. If in the past to lean Right meant to be a person that supports progressivism, and in todays world the left leaning supports progressivism, no matter what the title is the meaning and what is projected is the same. You are still a person in support of progressivism. This is a lesson in Human psych, history, and comprehension. This is not an argument about the technicalities of ones vocabulary. The definition of words WILL shift and change depending on how the people who say thus words use them. And ""left leaning""/""Right leaning"" has changed. The left TODAY were never ""like this at some point"". Those people who were ""like this at some point"" are right leaning in TODAYS world. The title may look the same but what they mean is completely different, so your argument is irrelevant. Your argument is like saying the Opium trade/smuggling wasn't horrible for china all because ""It was legal in Europe the 20th century"". All because it is legal does not make it a positive thing. Morality is subjective, but theres a fine line between positively affecting peoples and negatively affecting peoples. Before the late 20th century, horrible things that went against a whole group of people (EI: Minorities' African Americans) were legal. Does that make it right? Course not, and this isn't entirely subjective as it did negatively affect the lives of those group of innocent peoples.

No, we did not come through the asteroid strike that killed the dinosaurs ""as a species"". Yes our ancestors did, but they were tiny little things, little bigger than rodents, that didn't need the food supply the bigger animals needed. The ""nuclear winter"" that would have happened would have lasted no more than a couple decades and since it was so hot, its effect would not be that long lasting. Because it was so  hot before the asteroid impacted, the planet did NOT go into an ice age. ""If you wanna stick your head in the sand and ignore the reality around you fine by all means."" I am not the one that is ignoring reality. I read the REAL scientific journals, ones that you can only post articles about the scientific disciple IF you are a trained and working member of that disciple and it is reviewed by members ONLY of that disciple. Because those scientific fields are so well establish there are plenty of people in that field they can call on to have people review your article. As comparison, look at an article written by a marine biologist, published in nature, who claimed that since it was about the climate's effect on reefs, and since there aren't many people that study that, he needed certain people to review it. They allowed him to choose his reviewers, and he reviewed their papers so of course he was going to be 'nice' to them and allow their paper. No one questioned why he used CORRELATION to determine the death of the reefs. NO one asked for proof that it was the ph that was killing the reefs. NO one question if they had recovered. IF he had posted in a marine biology/oceanography peer review, it would have been shredded because there were plenty of LABORATORY evidence of it being due to pollution from ships being too close and from people walking on the reefs. There were also many articles that showed that when they restricted the ships to a certain distance and people banned from walking on the reefs, they recovered.

The earth warmed up 1° in 25 years in the late 1600's. It has only warmed up 1.1° in the last 120 years. There were periods where it has warmed over 2°C in a single century. There is nothing unprecedented in what has happened in the last century. There was a time sea levels rose by feet per year, where we have only had 3 MILLIMETERS in 5 years. The last 20 years rose the same amount as the first 20 years of the 1900's. ""natural change occurs over hundreds of thousands of years. "" No, they don't. There was a period 12000 years ago when the temperature dropped 5°C in a single 250 period. After a short time, it rose again. After the mwp, the temperature dropped 3°C in a matter of a century or so. Changes can happen rapidly. The only place you will find that the earth does not change rapidly is the much disproven hockey stick graph. "" This is the warming that brought us out of the last ice age"" No, that is the beginning of the Holocene maximum period. I was talking about the little ice age of a few centuries ago, not 12000 years ago. During the little ice age, the ice expanded a lot. After the little ice age, the glaciers began to retreat, but that was in spirts. The first was after 1650, and the last one was 150 years ago. THAT is when the glaciers began to retreat in the artic and in Canada and places like that. Look at this graph. http://www.co2science.org/subject/other/figures/temp10000.jpg As you can see it rose rapidly in the first few thousand years, then for a long time it was much hotter than it is now. Then the little ice age hit and it fell a lot. It has not recover that since. In proper scientific procedures you do not change the method of measurement in the middle of a graph. The only way they can FAKE the hockey stick, is to stop using proxies at around 1950. ""For example the first Ice age was caused by the over population of photosynthetic plant organisms pulling so much C02 from the air and adding so much O2 that it spiraled and caused a deep freeze."" No, it didn't. What cause the ice age we are currently in was the impact of the Indian and Eurasian plates creating the Himalayan mountains and the Antarctic plate drifting over the south pole and freezing. Co2 was 1000 ppm at that time. Co2 has been falling for millions of years but for the most part temperature were stable. Then the plates collided and the temperature fell. Then Antarctica drifted of the pole and it froze.",UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g,1,Ugxn6xKcWkcIW3GWLxp4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

That's the ONLY way they can create their alarms. Take for instance the insistence on ONLY using the data from the END of the little ice age, as if the LIA was the NORMAL temperature instead of the EXTREMELY COLD it was. OR when they talk about the ice cap disappearing they ONLY count the years since the 1970's the bottom of the 60 year cycle. ""just because you believe something and can find some evidence to support and validate those beliefs doesn't mean you are right."" Maybe, but what it means is that your THEORY has holes in it. AGW is a theory and if a theory has holes in it, according to standard scientific procedures, you remove it and either remaking where it takes into account all the data or you discard it. AGW zealots refuse to do either. They insist that it be given the status of scientific law. ""they feel superior in there personal beliefs over the beliefs of others."" Did you bother to read what you wrote? It has nothing to do with belief. Belief is religion. Science is data. IF the data does not match your theory, you adjust your theory. Agw zealots ADJUST THE DATA to match what they BELIEVE. The truth does not care what you believe or do not believe. The fact is, the warming started long before co2 went up. The fact is, temperature increases do not track co2 increases. The fact is, the co2 based model are all wrong. The fact is the north pole ice cap was at its greatest at the end of the little ice age, not 1970. It has melted every since. None of that cares if you believe or not. They are scientific facts. They are PROVEN facts. ""The real facts have long proven that human activities have drastically changed the environment."" Yes we have. With farming, with damming or channeling of rivers, with building cities, with mining, with pumping water out of the earth to irrigate deserts and more. BUT NOT with co2. We have polluted rivers and the skies. We have used pesticides that kill off insects and birds. We have destroyed animal habitats. We have fished some fish and hunted some animals to the edge of extinction, and possibly over the edge with a few. But we can not tax any of those and that's what this is about.

The problem is you need to look at all the facts not just the cherry picked ones that when pulled out of context can be used to validate what ever you believe to be right, but just because you believe something and can find some evidence to support and validate those beliefs doesn't mean you are right. In fact these days with the support of the internet you can find data to support any outlandish belief. Of course it doesn't really matter to people what the real truth is because they feel superior in there personal beliefs over the beliefs of others. The real facts have long proven that human activities have drastically changed the environment. Oh and what causes weather patterns? The environment! Human activities have in the past present and most definitely the future caused massive ecological disasters effecting entire ecosystems causing massive loss of life to plants animals and even humans. If you truly believe that humans have little to no effect on the planet and its systems then your scope of cognitive thought must be very close to the nano scale. You are however correct that the glaciers started melting long before the industrial revolution though. In fact that warming was part of the natural warming cycle of the planet. This is the warming that brought us out of the last ice age and made possible the Agricultural revolution which is thought to be the event that spawned modern humans & civilization. And very slowly over thousands of years the raise in temp continued. The difference between then and now is vast! The Industrial Revolution brought us into the tech age and mankind boomed like never before. Our population has risen so high that we have indeed invaded every facet on the surface of this planet. Individuals and small projects hardly seem like they could have an effect on this planet like this but when you scale those activities across the whole of the planet and the whole of mankind those numbers tell us something entirely different. The speed at which our planet is changing is indeed unprecedented in the entire known history of the planet. Yes climate naturally change over time but natural change occurs over hundreds of thousands of years. They dont happen over a few hundred years or even in several decades unless some outside direct traumatic force sets off runaway climate disasters. For example the first Ice age was caused by the over population of photosynthetic plant organisms pulling so much C02 from the air and adding so much O2 that it spiraled and caused a deep freeze. This still took hundreds of thousands of years to occur. Massive volcanic activity can set off both massive warming and mini Ice ages in various regions around the world throwing climates around the world out of wack. Big meteorite killed off dinosaurs and did pretty much the same. Caused extreme weather across the world and set in motion the Ice age that we came though as a species. My point is that the Human entity is large enough and effective enough to make real lasting effects on our world and climate. WW2 ended and the famous warning from Einstein and the other physicists who worked on the Manhattan project stated that for the first time in history human beings have the technological capacity to effectively end life as we know it on planet earth. It was the study of math, physics, chemistry, biology, Astrology and ecology that enabled people to develop all the tech you see and use today. If you doubt the intelligent findings of the people who made the modern world possible through testable experimentation & observation on a matter that scientists and scholars across the board over vastly different studies have found massive amounts of data that all point to rapid climate change and mass extinction and all because humans have tampered with the natural ecosystems across the planet. Sorry to pontificate so radically but when things go well pass the point of no return. ""we may already be too late!"" It will be people like you who stand in the way of our life boat that will be beaten by the mobs torched & dismembered limb from limb. If you wanna stick your head in the sand and ignore the reality around you fine by all means. Just don't stand in the way of the rationally intelligent who actually understand to a reasonable degree what is happening and what needs to be done. Don't let this beautiful blue marble teaming with life go the rout of every other astral body in our solar system just because its too big for you to wrap your mind around therefore must be some crazy hoax conspiracy. This is the classic frog set to slow boil situation. The frog only knows somethings wrong long after its too late to jump. Global climate change happens so slowly in regards to our time perspective and is driven and effected by so many different variables that the scale of it is understandably difficult to understand and therefore believe. Its also immensely terrifying so I understand not wanting to believe its possible. Fact is though there are a lot of terrifying things in this world and universe that are frankly very real.

Water is necessary for us to survive, but drinking enough of it is lethal. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. And again, the CO2 issue is one of many problems. Combined with rampant deforestation, human-led mass extinction, ocean acidification, and disappearing ice poles, it contributes to a massive problem that needs immediate and drastic attention. If the IPCC are exaggerating, which you haven’t proven they are, it’s to a necessary end. The fact is that we need to address this problem before the planet is uninhabitable, which will impact low-income and developing communities before major world players. Wealthy countries will likely wait until issues effect them before acting, at which point the Earth’s most vulnerable populations will be decimated.

The IPCC stated they dramatized the report because they did not get a strong enough response last time around. They are doing what all the media is doing now, which is using fear to sway public opinion and drive viewership. PS. I believe we should focus of pollutants prior to focusing on CO2. The Earth has a robust CO2 cycle, which can and always does modify itself to achieve balance. CO2 is not a pollutant, in fact it is a driver of the life cycle. Furthermore, fossil fuels are already out of date. As such, based on our current rate of advancement, they will be replaced with something cheaper, more convenient, and abundant or renewable in the near future regardless of fossil fuels' effects on the climate. For these reasons, and many more, I believe our efforts would be better placed reducing toxic chemical exposures, better recycling technology, something to replace plastic for disposables and packaging, reducing particulate emissions into the air, potable water infrastructure, sanitation, etc, etc, etc. CO2 should not be anywhere near the top of the list.",UCVY9USLHXDonuBWy-AlzgAA,1,UgxCD8RVam-vGz02F4B4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Those bastards have been using their fossil fuel money to deflect any and all attempts to tackle the issue of climate change. This is something that could have began in the nineties. It would have had to start slowly but it would have gained steam over time and by now would have meant the need for urgent action on climate change wouldn&#39;t be as dire. And it would have presented energy alternatives for rising industrial powerhouses china and India. Some thing as simple as putting a price on carbon can have a massive impact over time. Coal is cheap because the infrastructure to harness the energy in it is widespread and already in place but without factoring in the long term cost of global warming the price of coal is an illusion that masks its true price.,UCuSSg-3xxkTOvclvXx0gCWQ,0,UgxgE0w_fywSr18n2dF4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Trains are all fed from the electricity grid which can be replaced by renewables so unless you are living in the steam age with steam trains there is no reason trains can't be emission free if using green energy. The electric car revolution is just beginning. Cars as they are have been around for 100 years, give electric another 10 and they will be more than competitive - even TESLA has a new more affordable car now ($30K). Do you burn all your energy on site for your home? Idiotic reasoning to think solar on your roof will be the only energy source. Massive solar farms covering deserts will easily provide enough energy for households. No I blame republicans for not wanting to do anything.

This entire 12 min video is dedicated to portray the Republicans as bad and the Democrats as good.<br /><br />I have two problems with this video. First of all, it assumes change can be visible in the course of twelve years. This is false, especially when it comes to a problem that has been going on for 200 years. Besides, the awareness of climate change has improved and we can expect this to show results in the following 3 decades.<br /><br />The biggest problem however with this video, is how you make use of those two graphs to enforce your biased opinion without any context.<br />The thing is, the temperature rise and polar ice decrease hardly has anything to do with US politics. The truth is that countries such as China and India, both the most populated countries in the world, have been developing intensely for the past 12 years. This leads to more consumption of energy and thus more carbon emissions.<br />Leaving this fact out to share your badly argumented opinion is sickening.<br /><br />Listen, I know climate change is real and I find it a serious issue, and yes, our politics have to adapt to this problem.

There is no organization and everybody ends up just doing a negligible amount or the bare minimum (often nothing) due to refusals to make larger sacrifices than any given neighbor or other citizen.

So i will defer to your opinion. I was in no way trying to imply that nuclear waste is as big of an issue as climate change. I was trying to ask the right questions, questions that you most certainly have answered. I had no idea that 20 percent of the U.S. power source came from nuclear power plants. I only knew that nuclear power is a major supply of power in France. i think to most people who are not aware of the existential crisis caused by climate change, the possibility of a nuclear meltdown on the scale of three-mile island is far more intimidating than climate change. I used to live in long island in NY where the shoreham nuclear power plant was built. But due to the three-mile incident that happened during construction and chernobyl disaster that happened shortly afterwards, the power plant was forced to shutdown because not enough people would sign off on the evacuation plan. Even though the powerplant was paid for and built by the Long Island Power Company, the 6 billion price tag was shouldered to long island residents. what a shame.",UC2GuJaqSJJo5OrZGZxJpKSw,1,Ugw89DEoBVUU3oK3yNd4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

I can't be bothered to track down a thoroughly reliable source for those stats (although I have in the past). but to give an indication of relative scale is the median estimates produced by a 2014 IPCC report; Coal - 820 Gas - 490 Solar PV (utility) - 48 Solar PV (rooftop) - 41 Offshore wind - 12 Nuclear - 12 Now, I can't defend those precise figures (the emissions involved in Solar energy relative to other forms, in particular, is probably complicated and down to the manufacturing process), but they do chime with what I've seen in other sources. According to official US EIA, nuclear makes up 20% of electricity generation in the US. I'm not going to sit down and do the maths, and how bad the effect would be depends on whether you are switching to coal or natural gas, but the increase in emissions clearly wouldn't be trivial. Would it single-handedly be responsible for global climate change? No, but it might be enough that we see, say, a fraction of a degree more warming by the end of the century than if that had not happened. That means a little bit more sea level rise, a little bit worse drought in the Sahel, a little bit worse flooding in South Asia, a little increase in global food prices (leading to a little increase in the risk of civil unrest in some countries)...etc.. Putting a firm number of lives on that is impossible, or at least, not something I'm willing to do, but on a global scale over a long period of time, I'd expect numbers in at least the six or seven figures. Now you say 'catastrophic incident'...what catastrophic incident? Calculating risk is about measuring the severity of a hazard against its likelihood. A hazard which is very severe, but is very unlikely does not constitute a risk - hence why governments aren't constantly in a panic over asteroids or nearby supernova. If nulcear waste is buried deep underground, in spots far apart geographically, nothing short of a planetary collision would cause all of it to leak. And at that point, radiation would be the least of our problems. It's not in anyway comparable to climate change - we *know* would happen, if emissions increase, and it is obviously realistic that they could. Seriously though, if you can name me one hazard, other than human tampering, that could cause stored nuclear waste all over the US to leak at once without also wiping out human civilisation, I would be eager to hear it.",UC2irH5qC_klr4yzEZBZy25A,1,Ugw89DEoBVUU3oK3yNd4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Suppose you decommision every nuclear powerplant in the U.S. and replaced with fossil fuels. Yes, it will accelerate climate change. But by how much? More to the point, how much earlier will we reach tipping point threshold and what would be the difference in human fatalities? Now lets consider the reverse scenario. Lets say some catastrophic incident results in all the nuclear waste in all nuclear plants to be leaked into the environment. how many lives will be lost directly or indirectly? is this number greater or less than the former scenario? I have no idea. but if the latter is higher, then i must conclude the threat of nuclear contamination is greater than the threat of a accelerated global warming due to replacing nuclear plants with fossil fuel plants.",UC2GuJaqSJJo5OrZGZxJpKSw,1,Ugw89DEoBVUU3oK3yNd4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Firstly, as crude as it sounds, digging a very deep hole and burying the waste is actually a pretty effective safety measure - sites are carefully selected based on their geology so that, even if humans were to disappear tomorrow, no additional radiation would be felt at the surface - in some places they even design them with the return of ice sheets in thousands of years in mind. Secondly, nuclear waste and climate change are on completely incomparable scales as hazards - nuclear accidents/waste residues are localised, the effects are predictable and quantifiable, and dimish to levels that aren't _that_ harmful, to humans or especially the environment, pretty quickly. At worst, people can just move away from the affected area. Climate change screws over humanity and the environment in so many ways, it's hard to know where to start. Nuclear power stations aren't the only way of generating electricity, but until we can find a way of _storing_ electricity or efficiently transmitting it long distances, intermittent renewables present issues if you want to move to 100% fossil-fuel free electricity. As it stands, when the sun isn't shining and the wind doesn't blow, you _need_ fossil fuel or nuclear plants to keep the lights on - this isn't a problem when renewables make up a minority of the energy mix, but we need to do better than that.",UC2irH5qC_klr4yzEZBZy25A,1,Ugw89DEoBVUU3oK3yNd4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

We, as human beings, should adapt just as we shouldn&#39;t build houses near the coast so the next hurricane just don&#39;t blow the whole thing up. It&#39;s always weird when we talk about &#39;natural disasters&#39; we don&#39;t ask ourselves how &#39;natural&#39; they are. And that was only an example because we know that there&#39;s no scientific evidence, according to the IPCC, for a correlation between climate change and hurricanes and storms. In the last century temp went up 1°C and that wasn&#39;t the most important event of the century, think about the catastrophic events of WWI and WWII. So even if things change in the future that doesn&#39;t mean is going to be worse. The other way to see it is that the whole scientific premise is wrong: is way too difficult to even measure the planet temp. There&#39;s a scientific and a social and moral problem to the &#39;consensus&#39;. And finally what is it that I should be convinced? Climate change is real, probably getting warmer, not so sure but let&#39;s say man-made is part of it, but the lack of encouragement to adapt, instead of trying to keep things as they are which is very costly, and the moral argument make it difficult to digest.",UC7kqXbmMQ4_MS6mGwLTkkJA,0,Ugx0l2iPLA4OWtb76Jp4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

We know we cannot count and rely on our government so we need to find ways to take matters into our own hands and work together. Yes, one thing we can do is go out and vote that does help. But what a lot of people also don’t realize is that one of the easiest ways to help combat climate change is our consumption and I’m not just talking about oil and fossil fuels I’m also talking about the actual food we eat. <br /><br />It is known that the animal agriculture industry is one of of the top contributors to greenhouse gases in our atmosphere so we, as a collective can make a conscious effort to consume less. The less consumption, the less demand there will be and therefore less supply will be needed. <br /><br />I’m not saying you need to be 100% vegan or vegetarian but at least taking one or two days out of your week to not consume animal products can make a huge difference! I know people hate vegans and they always think they’re all righteous and what not but please do your own research and see how much of a difference we can all make if we just made minor lifestyle adjustments. <br /><br />Same thing goes for waste, be conscious of your plastic use and try to use reusable items when possible. <br /><br />Don’t wait for these clowns in Washington to save us. They won’t, most of them are going to die soon anyway and just care about how much money they have in the bank. <br /><br />WE HAVE MORE POWER THAN THEM. <br /><br />They rely on our fear and ignorance to push their ridiculous agendas, don’t give them that power.

In other words, the hotter Earth becomes, the more CO2 is released from various natural sources. [It's well known that in a warm El Nino year, more CO2 is released by the ocean into the atmosphere (and less taken up by the ocean from the atmosphere), while during cool La Nina years just the opposite happens.] Read that again, the hotter Earth becomes, the more CO2 is released from various natural sources. In other words, the entire premise of anthropogenic or ""man made"" global warming (AGW) where increased atmospheric CO2 causes the temperature to rise is flawed from the beginning. To reiterate, global temperatures have been rising for the last 300 years since the Little Ice Age (LIA) and even climate alarmists cannot blame human activity as the cause. Now the scary part; there has been no increase in the earth's average temperature for over 18 years despite the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. This recovery from the LIA is completely beneficial. Earlier springs and later falls means longer growing seasons and longer growing seasons means more food. Then there is that well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle and the undeniable effects of solar fluctuations and cosmic activity that just may have some small effect on our world's temperature. Need I remind you cold winters kill more people than hot summers? You're asking for more taxes, more laws, less freedoms and creating a market where only the largest conglomerates will survive. It is everything I am against. You unknowingly do this as you have been indoctrinated at school and at home via the television; both of which are controlled by the same people.

Due to industrialisation, the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere has increased dramatically over the last 150 years. Carbon Dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, is produced by burning fossil fuels. A fossil fuel is a natural fuel like coal or gas which is created from dead organisms buried under the ground for millions of years. These fuels are not created fast enough to keep up with our current demand and we will run out of them some day. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity and power transportation such as cars, airplanes and boats. In 2007, fossil fuels made up 86.4% of the world’s energy consumption. Due to this, a large amount of carbon dioxide is released into the environment from the production of energy. Plants are naturally supposed to convert Carbon Dioxide back into oxygen. Unfortunately, due to deforestation there are less plants to do this. Climate change will cause sea levels to rise, causing massive flooding all over the world, cause the average temperature to increase and will inevitably make it harder for life to exist on Earth.",UCrHuQnPJBtClH3aHUXlDGIQ,0,Ugwo2ZEK131pA4212Jx4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

President Obama's efforts to fight climate change were opposed by the GOP as part of a broader effort to undermine his presidency and protect their political power. And perhaps most of all, there is a growing sense of despair as we come to realize that measures to stop global climate change are increasingly harmful to our way of life. 30 years ago, it may have been possible to stop climate change with a cap and trade bill and investments in renewable energy. Now, however, extreme financial burdens would really be required at this point to ensure that we stop climate change. Unfortunately, this isn't going to change without a true sea change within the GOP, and among the nation at large.

I keep hearing oh population explosion and fossil fuels mean were doomed but it just doesnt make sense, Europe's population is steady and in some cases declining , who is to say Africa india and China won't do so aswell when they catch up to the level of development Europe is at now. Every year solar and fusion become more viable (wind is stuck behind a physics barrier) and as soon as its actually cheaper than coal and NG it will be immediately implemented so companies can make the most money. The precautionary principle better safe than sorry doesnt apply here either. Renewables are just more expensive than fossile fuels and mandating their usage means that less people get power. Maybe our cities have to move inland but millions of African lives are cut short burning wood fires indoors because of lack of electricity, electricity we could easily make with coal plant technology and African natural resources.

You can't simplify this issue to oh we burnt fossils and made co2 that's causing this until we completely describe the carbon dioxide cycle. Why was there 10 times the co2 as now before humans showed up, how did earth fix itself then. How does the amount of clouds and plants on earth change as co2 changes, cooling earth.

As for your second argument, it’s pretty simple really. The carbon dioxide is causing the ozone layer to become thinner and in some places, disappear altogether. The ozone layer is what protects the earth from the sun’s radiation. Without the ozone layer, the sun’s rays can reach the earth’s surface with little to no interference, causing the earth’s temperature to rise at a higher rate. Also, the ozone layer is NOT what keeps heat or gasses inside of the atmosphere, dumbass. The carbon dioxide will stay in the atmosphere regardless. So, 1. The thinning of the ozone layer is causing the earth to heat at a higher rate, and 2. The carbon dioxide is preventing that heat from leaving the atmosphere.

With the magnitude of outrages claims he is making, there are only two possibilities: He's running down a rabbit hole, to protect his ego from certain break-down, after discovering his own foolishness, or he is trolling you. Most of what you mentioned, I heard on several ""climate change isn't man made""-debates. There was a study that found the ice surface at one of the poles was increasing, which was caused, by melting ice dripping into the sea, where it froze again (due to difference in freezing points between salt and fresh water). This was pulled horribly out of context by media, and especially conservative media like crowder. What they failed to mention was why there was seemingly more ice, and that at the other pole ice was melting 3 times as fast. So I assume this is where his ""Russian model"" is coming from. The google is part of the free masons stuff, that is just him channeling his inner Alex Jones.

He has argued the planet isn't warming all the way to it is warming, but not ""catastrophic"" warming, a term he refuses to define.

He still hasn't explained how, if you can't sell it at $4 you will make a fortune at $1.50. He also is yet to explain how if everyone has converted to RE, like he claims the FF industry is trying to do, where the market for algal fuel will be. He also hasn't explained why the FF industry is the major funder of the denial industry supposedly combating the ""hoax"" they invented. He also tries to project a hate for the FF industry because of this ""hoax"" yet defends them at every turn, including the far larger subsidies to the FF industry is not a subsidy it's just tax breaks so can't be counted. He even claims they need more, such as for algal fuel. The exact reason he hates the FF industry and why they started the ""hoax"".

He claims to have a Russian model that explains how this causes less light to be reflected to space and this decreasing ice coverage is causing the warming. Yet he has argued glaciers are growing, which according to his theory, would be cooling the planet not warming it. He yet can't explain how glaciers started to melt, they just did. He has claimed this peer reviewed study is readily available in libraries. I haven't found it so asked him for the source so I could look at it. He said it was in a journal, probably sold and probably had it's name changed anyway. I asked him to link a copy. He claimed impossible, I showed him it wasn't. He claimed Google is part of the world wide conspiracy with the FF industry to bankrupt themselves so they changed all the peer reviewed studies, and apparently the copies in libraries and everyone's personal copies as well, to give the opposite conclusion of what they originally said. Because all studies, according to Robert, show AGW is a ""hoax"", it's just Google has changed those conclusions.

""You are one of the only stupid people who want to pay more for things just because they are made by the FF industry and other large polluters"" First off, I am one the smart people that does my own research by reading REAL peer review journals, from REAL scientist using REAL scientific methods. I don't let others tell me what to think, unlike you. I do not pay more because they are from ff companies. third co2 is not a pollutant. Its a plant food. It is responsible for a third of the almost 50% increase in food production in the last 30 years and it will just continue to do so.  ""YES THEY DO, $5.3 trillions a year."" Those are tax cuts, not hand outs. Every company does so. Incentives is a discount on governmental cost of doing business other than to taxes. For instance, a small business might have to pay for a right of way to be added, while one of the incentives would be to pave the road for the business and wave the right of way fees. Not every fee is a tax and not ever tax is a fee. So they get incentives which are NOT hand outs. Hand out are when a company gets money form the federal government in the form of a grant, like RE companies do. http://insideenergy.org/2016/11/04/ie-questions-how-does-the-government-subsidize-oil-and-gas/ Notice that coal and gas get tax cuts not handouts. ""Then unless you are a fool bloody native american I'll assume you will pack up and go back to where you came from then?"" There is a big difference between illegal alien and legal ones. Those that came legally paid do to so. Those that did not are leaches. Besides some of my ancestors walked across the land bridge. When the English got here they paid for the land. ""which found AGW was happening. "" So which is it? Are they spending billions on research or did they only spend a few million and stop? You cant have it both ways. ""The science of AGW was around long before algal oil and it is not economically viable and electric cars will soon replace the ICE long before it does."" The science of agw used to be the science of agc. Then it was climate change, then it was drastic weather changes. Its so hard to keep up. The only reason algae oil is not economical is the price of gas is below $4 a gallon. If the carbon tax the ff companies want push through happens, that will drop the cost to below $1.50 a gallon. Then electric cars will not be able to compete. Unless the tax goes through electric cars can not compete. So electric cars are nothing more than a fad. ""No it was not."" Yes, for 200 years they have know of the oscillation and every science EXCEPT man made climate change knows its there. ""it is not responsible for the underlying warming trend."" Sorry but your ignorance is showing. There is a definite warming BUT the trend itself is controlled by a 60 year cycle. Add the warming with the 60 year cycle and add the solar sunspots, and you get the warming for the last 350 years. Its natural, not man made. ""So you agree with the hockey stick now"" Quite the contrary. The tree ring shows CLIMATE change, and that is in a 60 year pattern. It doesn't matter if the earth is in a cooling or a warming, it still shows the 60 year cycle in the climate. This include rain, temperature, clouds and more. The hockey stick says you can forget all the other dozens of things that show up. During the mwp, the 60 year cycle showed up in tree rings. During the little ice age, the 60 year cycle showed up in the tree rings. This is because whether the climate is warming or cooling, the 60 year is being affected by something bigger. ""YOU have no idea as the data is managed and were ""changed"" by Christy and Spencer"" And WHO told you this? Dr. Spencer stated multiple times he has never alter the data since it was not necessary. Dr. Christy has also stated in the congressional hearings that he did not alter the data. All the ""altering"" that either of them did was via an algorithm that compared the altitude of the satellites using the geostationary and gps satellites and that was only once a year. They predicted nasa would alter them and they were correct. NO ONE asked them about the alterations. ""They have corrected their ""mistakes"" several times."" No, if you listen to the admiral who used to be in charge of NASA he will tell you that it was their team that altered the data to ""correct"" the data to match the models predictions. ""NOTHING compared to the $5.3 trillion a year in taxpayer funded handouts for the FF industries DENIALISM and the constant wars for oil to protect those assets."" And not a penny of that goes to research. so what does the 5.3 trillion lie have to do with the fact that more money is paid by alarmist organization for research that supports agw. Not a penny from them is paid if  you don't agree. FF companies do not pay much money for anti agw, since they do not need to. They actually want the carbon tax to pass since it will give the ff companies a monopoly. ""Such as another planet to live on after your overlords get done destroying this ones environment. "" Sorry, I don't have any overlords. What it like having Al Gore crack his whip over you all the time? ""Well get out of the mirror then or stop making stupid comments such as the only reason coal power stations are loosing money is the haven't been built yet. Stupid."" Do you seriously not see how stupid that is? They cant lose money until they are built and the reason they are is they cant run at efficient levels because there is so little demand, compared to the supply. ""Yet they have cancelled over 150 coal power plants and are rapidly expanding RE"" I would have to see the evidence of this. I have seen the evidence that they have shuttered a lot of older, i.e. 5 year old plants, while they are still building more. IF they were shutting down coal plants and going to RE would they have rising co2 level worse than any the US ever had? ""No war is too big to protect the FF industry."" You need to learn to read. This isn't about going to war over ff industry, but a war with china, likely ww3. One of the first thing anyone does is bomb the power plants. Ok, so we bomb some of china, and what does it do? Nothing, it has such a huge over stock that it would not have to worry. Then if you continued to bomb them faster than they can rebuild, they take some out of mothballs and get them running. China is preparing for ww3 for decades. They want to rule the world and the current leader is intent on it happening while he is alive. ""Good a reason for war as any right?"" Idiot, it isn't a reason for the war, its in preparation for the war. If we go to war with china, they can bomb our power plants and half the country would be shut down for years.

Do you have any data to back this up? Climate data from thousands of years ago to set a standard? Of course not. Everything you think is your best GUESS. There is no science in what you said. Our best climate data barely goes back a century in most places. The earth is over four and half billion years old. The snapshot we've seen is nothing in the long run. Hurricanes too. We don't know how bad they were 200 years ago, or 2,000 years ago. What you're doing is actually closer to fear mongering. Stoking up emotions. It's a common enough tactic, if a bit juvenile. Your bias has clouded your judgement, and mine too I'm sure. The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle. By the way, it's not the west that will ruin the world.

I think how the USA is currently behaving is ridiculous with all this tariff crap and trying to destroy the Canadian economy because Trump is bored.

A new era of life can begin. The continents the climate, the earth, the biota of this world, will march forward and carry on with out us. Evolution by natural selection, will create new, and bizarre forms of life. We will drive ourselves extinct before we even begin to do real damage to the planet.

Yet he supports the idea that the oceans are rising as a result of human activity. Make up your mind, Mitt.<br /><br />But even if it was unintentional, he is correct that human behavior doesn&#39;t lead to climate change. Meteorological changes are occurring on all of the planets, not just Earth.Are humans causing the changes on Jupiter?<br /><br />The climate IS changing but humans are not causing it and CO2 is not a factor.<br />- Temperature change precedes CO2 levels, it doesn&#39;t follow it.<br />- CO2 is good. It is plant food. When CO2 levels have been highest, plant life flourished.<br />- The climate has always fluctuated, both long and short term. And no matter what the global norm is, there are areas of deviation. The Earth has systems that mitigate the human contribution. <br /><br />Learn the real science:<br />- Why &quot;Global Warming&quot; Failed &amp; Why Climate Change is Real<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c4XPVPJwBY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c4XPVPJwBY</a><br />- Global Warming in a Climate of Ignorance | Space News<br /><a href=""https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/03/04/global-warming-in-a-climate-of-ignorance-space-news/"">https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/03/04/global-warming-in-a-climate-of-ignorance-space-news/</a><br />- Global Warming and Our Electric Sun | Space News:<br /><a href=""https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/03/11/global-warming-and-our-electric-sun-space-news/"">https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/03/11/global-warming-and-our-electric-sun-space-news/</a><br />- Sacrifice, Delusion and Climate<br /><a href=""http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2011/arch11/110509climate.htm"">http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2011/arch11/110509climate.htm</a><br /><br />Finally, before you place too much stock in news reports, check this to see how easy it is to let bad science and fraudulent data slip into the science journals:<br />- How three MIT students fooled the world of scientific journals<br /><a href=""https://news.mit.edu/2015/how-three-mit-students-fooled-scientific-journals-0414"">https://news.mit.edu/2015/how-three-mit-students-fooled-scientific-journals-0414</a>",UCxzqcCXq9x-W7KFfDQG-G8Q,0,Ugxxn-fY42EKJ7g_fdV4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Most countries have increased their forests, including Europe. It's true, that it's not the case of Brazil but, deforestation has decreased dramatically in the last 15 years. In 2004, 27.000 km2 of deforestation happened. In 2013, last year with data), 5.000 km2 (+80% less). What I mean is that deforestation was a BIG problem the last decade, but it's been already better addressed than expected, and the global trend is increasing forests. In Europe, Agriculture is 8% of the total emissions. Actually, if you don't spend your holidays using the plane, you save much more CO2 than not eating meat. Or having efficient fridge and air condition.

The simplest way to cut greenhouse gasses is to just consume less. You don't have to buy anything to cut your own consumption. If you consume less you are helping the environment and saving money. And if you have to buy something like a car isn't it better that that car was made efficiently and it consumes less? And if you are scared you don't need to buy anything. Why don't you want a car that consumes less and makes more power with less fuel? I don't understand. We have 1l (1000cc) engines today that produce over a 100 bhp. I think that's incredible. One reason for this is because companies are conforming to regulations. Without regulations and public demand for lower consumption there is little incentive for companies to develop more efficient engines and push the limits of technology. This applies to other industries too. But not oil, gas and coal. The less efficient your car is, the more oil or electricity you spend the more money they make. They have no incentive to have you consume less. This is the conflict of interest. And you can see politicians will tell you w Every new technology is expensive in the beginning. Think cell phones and computers in the 90s. But once these new technologies start being mass produced they will bring jobs and economic growth without polluting. Why is that a bad thing?

Merely generating the relatively small proportion of our energy that we consume today in the form of electricity is already an insuperably difficult task for renewables: generating huge amounts more on top to carry out the tasks we do today using fossil-fuelled heat isn’t even vaguely plausible. Even if one were to electrify all of transport, industry, heating and so on, so much renewable generation and balancing/storage equipment would be needed to power it that astronomical new requirements for steel, concrete, copper, glass, carbon fibre, neodymium, shipping and haulage etc etc would appear. All these things are made using mammoth amounts of energy: far from achieving massive energy savings, which most plans for a renewables future rely on implicitly, we would wind up needing far more energy, which would mean even more vast renewables farms – and even more materials and energy to make and maintain them and so on.

This is by far the most important point - the rich and powerful control the world, at least try to make it so the powerful are not deniers with that little power of choice that is afforded to you - don't let China get away with saying that authoritarianism beats democracy on climate change 2. Reduce your meat consumption and/or prefer chicken to other meats - 1Kg of chicken takes just 20% of the resources compared to 1Kg of beef 3. When possible try to prefer green alternatives in everything you buy, but for god's sake RESEARCH what is actually 'green' before marching down the roads with ""no nuclear"" signs (nuclear is actually great for climate change since a few tonnes underground are better than billions of tonnes in our air and lungs) 3.1. Point 3 withstanding, remember that it's almost always better to KEEP a functioning non-green product over buying a new shiny green one if you don't actually need the replacement. Green things are great but producing them also harms the environment. EG don't throw away your 2-year-old gasoline car to buy a Tesla 4. Transport modes from best to worst: - Bycicle/foot - Subway/Train in states and countries that use at least some nuclear and/or renewables - Bus/Other public transport + Subway/Train in states and countries that run only fossil - Electric, hydrogen, methane, LPG, diesel*, gasoline car in this order - Airplane (yes this is WORSE than gasoline and diesel) * On diesel: diesel is far WORSE than anything when it comes to _pollution_ , that is, poisonous particles that directly harm your body. However, from a thermodynamic standpoint it is more efficient than gasoline, which means it emits less CO2. Contrary to popular belief, CO2 and particulate are two separate things - particulate harms us and animals immediately like a poison, CO2 worsens global warming and harms the planet in the long run. With diesel you are trading our immediate physical health for a slight CO2 reduction compared to gasoline - I'd suggest not having to make that trade in the first place. Note: because particulate is really bad in cities, don't get diesel if you drive in cities as critical levels will cause it to be banned more and more in there.",UCSbuEcfgJRPFGncGHXA2rOA,1,UgwYSuVLW7nnSFEmKix4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

I don't doubt the potential of fusion power or the potential for leaving fossil fuels in the near future - provided the political obstacle can get over it. And I admit. I'm a marine conservation scientist so I have my field of expertise and there are many others I would have to investigate before I could call myself a full climate expert (especially since I look into the biology side more than the physiochemical side) but that doesn't limit what I've read and seen. I'd like you to link me to these confused papers you describe so I can see if it's just interpretation or if it's the sourcing that's a little off... I know when I started reading around one subject I was googling the definitions of every other word just to keep up with the paper but as you get used to the language used, it gets easier to read them... And coffee helps immensely... The problem with climate change is not that 'it's happening' but that its happening way too fast. Imagine this: The last little ice age around 10,000 years ago was a cold point and after that, the world started warming. Then we hit the medieval warm period and it began to cool again until the got industrial and global temperatures began to pull up and as the human race industrialised, our carbon output magnified exponentially. You can understand that there is a limited amount of carbon on earth and that before we started burning coal, it was largely contained underground in oil and coal deposits. When we began to dig those up and burn it, we started bringing that carbon out of the ground stores and into the atmosphere. From there it has to deposit somewhere so it can dissolve into the oceans through a process called 'atmospheric deposition' and yes, for a while it will result in an increase in plant growth - but I'll get back to that later - it's not as simple as they want you to believe (every time I hear that argument my inner ecologist just screams). This carbon source and sink theory is pretty well founded and yes, it does reflect reality. It can be simplified to the simple idea of 'concentration gradients' - if anything is highly concentrated and there is nothing causing it to hold together (temperature is uniform/no static charges etc) then the concentration will diffuse 'down the gradient' and alike molecules will separate (it's the same concept that means oxygen will diffuse into your blood and carbon dioxide with diffuse out of your blood in the lungs but the gases don't stop each other from diffusing in opposite directions) so the oceans act as a giant global sink for just about anything in the atmosphere - ocean acidification is a simple chemical process that occurs when carbon dioxide is diffused into water - a polar molecule (as in it has little micro-electric charges on the molecule due to a concept known as 'electronegativity - this means that it only allows things to dissolve in it if it's molecules can be made equally polar - so salt dissolves into it's ions of sodium and chloride and in this case - Carbon Dioxide dissolves into carbonic acid. That's the chemistry bit done so if you're all good with that - let's move on to why this screws marine life. Limestone is Calcium Carbonate - it is made of the fossilised remains of calcium based lifeforms - largely a kind of phytoplankton called 'coccolithophores' but impurities remain in the form of anything also fossilised that isn't explicitly calcium carbonate based (- a fish skeleton isn't a carbonate and sharks don't have traditional bones) and this (in case you haven't seen the White Cliffs od Dover in the UK) makes up quite a huge amount of marine organisms - crustaceans (all crabs, lobsters and shrimps) have an exoskeleton made of this stuff (and shrimps or krill make up a hugely important component of fish diets (it's the reason salmon is pink, ask if you're unsure) which would have a drastic knock-on effects on fish stocks globally. Not to mention all shellfish in general would suffer and struggle to maintain populations - marine snails, clams, starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers (lovingly nicknamed the 'trashmen of the sea' for their role in material recycling. I include Echinoderms like starfish because they too have calcareous skeletons). Hope that's not too much, it's just about 6 textbooks worth of reading condensed into a rather specific topic. (Don't even get me started on corals - it would be another paragraph just like this one). Let's get to the feedback argument. The stability argument you make (or as I interpret it, clearly communicated ideas and answers are hard to come by but that's what's so great about the internet - near instant communication! We'll figure it out, don't you worry) comes from the point that the earth is a continually feedback influenced system. If albedo was to increase due to less sea ice - the water would be absorbing more of the sunlight than would have been reflected by the ice. Agreed? (Sorry, I need to know at which point this stops making sense to you, okay?) The water absorbs more sunlight and thus warms up more than with the sea ice overhead causing the water to expand (that's right, water expands with increasing temperature, water at around 4 degrees C is the densest water and it's why deep sea water is usually that temperature it sinks below colder and hotter water - not certain about the exact hydrodynamics though, I'm not an oceanographer). The expanded water takes up more land under it's area and the global ocean area is now a little bigger - allowing for more heat input from sunlight and causing further expansion. As the temperature increases at the surface, more evaporation takes place too, resulting in more sudden and violent storms (again, not a meteorologist but by understanding says this heating up is in no way good for land or for sea). Now, the actual problem with all of this climate change debacle is the pace it happens at. If the oceans only got slightly more acidic a little bit over a few thousand years, the species' as a whole that live there would have evential adaptations to let them survive and live into the next epoch. Same goes for terrestrial changes - if the oceans where to rise slowly over a few thousand years, then salt marsh species would be able to retreat with the land and nothing would really go extinct until an ecological collapse occurs (when enough species vital to the existence of an ecosystem - like trees in a forest or corals for a reef - where to stop living and stop existing. Essentially ending that environment and leaving the organisms that depend on that environment with adaptations that do them no favours at all - resulting in a chain of extinctions). What humans do however, is find news ways to force things to happen faster and more efficiently so of course we found almost all of the world's carbon deposits and released almost all of it into the atmosphere in just a few centuries (no normal volcano or even chain of volcanoes could do what we have already done). Humans have one thing I appreciate greatly - we can do things like no other species ever could. No beaver can make a dam like humans can, no bird can fly as high, no worm can dig as deep, no fish can swim as far and through technology we have almost broken this world. The least we could do is give at least some other organisms time to evolve and catch up with the new epoch we have created. By now, I hope I have outlined some of the mechanisms, of course having my oceanographer friend alongside me would help but she's on the other side of the planet right now currently investigating the effects of ocean acidification of coccolithophores. I realise that you will still have many many questions about the specifics of why this is such a bad thing and I can do my best to interpret exactly what it is you don't quite click with and why but that's why we need to end the shouting war and start communicating clearly and honestly. If there is anything I've described that doesn't quite make sense to you, reply with a clear and concise question on what it is you don't quite click with and I'll do my best to help.",UCmBM_zY0kzQI3MCFayEbzAw,1,UgyUf_jP4BM6sdsK6fJ4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

As we get more co2 vegetation increases and absorbs more c02. Is that the only negative feedback factor besides our radiation increasing? If what your saying is true and the system is balanced and any perturbation of co2 will be unbalanced the system is unstable. Then how did life survive back when there was tons of co2? Did they not have bones or shells ? I guess the Crux of the question is, the earth system is inherently stable somehow, If it were not we would get snowball earth with runaway albido. Or become mars with runway heating forever ago. So what makes earth stable, why cant this factor fix the issue, how is aquatic life structurally different now than in the eocene or other high co2 periods and how do we trust the predictions of models which seem to always include a ""tipping point"" when we know such a thing would have tipped us already by now. Isnt the essence of science that if our theory doesnt hold up to reality even once it's wrong? I'm not gonna argue about complex food chains and biology... that I'm just curious about seeing as your the expert. I'm pretty scientifically literate and I've read the atmospheric studies for global warming and seen them updated again and again, at some point it's not a constant in front of the variable you gotta change it's the variables your considering. I believe we are causing to some degree climate change and I believe it will damage the earth and the ecosystems. I just dont see the evidence of it being catastrophic or unprecedented. I strongly believe in my lifetime we will have fusion power and ubiquitous electric vehicles, China already had a fusion source going for over a minute. Lockheed says 2025 there's will be running. Then we will need no more co2 for power production, how can everything fall apart before then. What am I missing ?

Think again, read an actual paper on the subject by a major journal and you'll be sorely disappointed in your politicians. CO2 is a natural gas, but the system usually consists of both carbon sinks and carbon sources. There are natural sources like volcanos and natural forest fires and there are sinks like growing forests and the oceans are both depending on the relative saturation between the atmosphere and the water. But even if humans only add a small amount, it's a small amount that has nowhere to go in this already balanced system. Things where in equilibrium for a bit but now it's got a much heavier input. Now the oceans and atmosphere are receiving most of our input and the effect of CO2 in atmosphere leading to a greenhouse effect have been recorded and known for over 120 years. It's basically fact. What's more concerning for me (as a marine conservation scientist) is that it also saturates the oceans and as the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the water, it disaccoiates into carbonic acid. In case you hadn't noticed, the majority of marine life uses calcium based shells and skeletons. In an acid medium, these will all be dissolved which isn't just cruel and painful, it means the end of all marine snails, crustaceans and corals as well as many more delicate organisms (ever seen a nudibranch? One of the most amazing slugs you'll ever see, but they could quite easily be wiped out by this). Just remember, it's not that climate change is happening. It's that humans are making it happen way too fast.

The rate is just how quickly we get more total in the air. I get that is quicker now but it's only like 50 times quicker than previously and previously it warmed for 10,000 years. do you really think that many animals die because of overheating by a few degree Cl?

Firstly, they discuss how the melting glaciers have already led to the flooding of coastal cities, and cut to an image of a flooded neighborhood. I think it is safe to say that no neighborhoods are permanently flooded yet, right? I'm sure that they took this picture from after a horrible storm, so that is blatant misinformation on their part. The graphs that they show aren't a very strong argument to me, and here's why. They show the increase in temperature, then the increase of carbon dioxide. The hockey stick-looking increase in the Carbon Dioxide graph has already been statistically disproven, yet we still show it in textbooks and youtube videos. Lastly, here is something I found very interesting the first time I heard it, and NatGeo was pretty ignorant to this. NatGeo claims that the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would end in world-wide drought and the lack of accessibility of clean water. But that just isn't reality. The Sahara desert, millions of years ago, was a rainforest. If you raise temperatures, you raise the possibility of evaporation and precipitation. If you raise that possibility of evaporation and precipitation, you receive a wetter climate. If anything, we would facilitate more of a jungle world than we would a desert, because it isn't like all of this water can go anywhere. It is stuck in our atmosphere and has to return as precipitation eventually. I feel that this video was either intentionally uninformed or new facts have been discovered since its filming.",UCpw3r5SFUCdPTPmtKi4PORg,1,Ugzx32qtcpNR8d3RZqN4AaABAg,yzDjjUAt3zc,2018-10-10 23:05:05

Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere haven't reached today's levels in hundreds of thousands of years.

I thought we all agreed that things had to change, but then nothing changed. I see more and more people living indulgent lifestyles: Driving big trucks they don't need. Buying big homes they don't need. Eating more than they need. It's all a part of the same issue. Americans don't understand minimalism and reduction. The Christian values in this country have corrupted our culture. We simply believe we should take what we want, because it was given to us by God. Nothing has changed. 75 Percent of Americans identify as Christian... 75 percent of Americans still believe that they can take what they believe they need from God's green Earth. No matter what advancements we've made in science in the past 100 years, we still act on the same old fashioned desires. The idea of a big family with a big home. The strong dad that knows how to handle a hammer and drives a big manly truck while he eats a lot of meat and drinks beer with the beautiful wife that stays at home and cooks all of the meals for the family. I'm not being ironic here. This old country lifestyle that people so badly want in America is the reason why NO ONE wants to act on climate change.

They keep saying that they do not know what creates Climate Change, that is bull, I know and so will you after watching this geological documentary. And if we know, then they should know, certainly the scientists. Climate change is a natural mechanism of nature, we can't stop that even if we put all the money we have on earth in it. We can't stop the wobble of our earth, but humans are just unwilling to accept that nature is stronger then them. NOT saying we shouldn't be less polluting as humanity, but there simply are things we can not change, and nature is one of them. We do not cause precession as the soil research proves this mechanism has been influencing Earth for centuries. It happened before we build cars and factories, and it will happen long after humanity is extinct. So the whole idea that we humans can change this is an illusion. Instead we should focus on how to deal with it, instead of thinking we can prevent it as we can't ! This scientific geology documentary will show the cause of climate change, and you can verify it in the Chinese and US deserts as well, as the desert belt is not only located in the sahara. So there various ways to verify this further, but since humanity is in denial, i guess it will take years before the mass of humanity will know about this.
