If you were to undertake the classic path of Bachalor's -> Master's -> Ph. D. and then got employed fresh out of your Ph. D. programme (although it's usually better to do some postdocs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) before doing that), you could be permanently employed at the age of 27-32 (with the average somewhere around 29). However, the whole point of Ph. D. is learning how to properly do research (reducing the number to about 25), and the final year of your Master's is also spent doing research, although it's usually under guidance from some advisor, so the final answer could be 24. That being said, most countries offer some option for high school students to have an internship at some research institute, so I would advise you to look for something like that, as you could get a sense of what does it take to be a researcher and test whether it's right for you :) If you have any more questions, definitely ask away :D",UC2exk5uWPUnGBgxuAbnHMBw,1,Ugw60IpL4O6tjAlFUyd4AaABAg,KkmNUK-kwmM,2021-01-21 10:51:47
