I'd say here it's absolute humidity. It would have to be. Apparently the water vapour goes up a lot with increasing temperatures. Unbelievable? Maybe. Don't forget I'm just repeating what Monckton pointed out. I wouldn't have had a clue as to what he says was going on, but now he has pointed it out, it makes sense. He says in one of his talks that they applied control theory (which involves feedback effects) but didn't apply it correctly. That's pretty plausible, after all one of the touted benefits of science is that it is self correcting, and sure enough, along comes Monckton to point out an error, eventually. But I can absolutely understand how an error could slip through at first. Especially when scientists go outside of their field of expertise. I remember when I was in university and in lab. experiments, we'd be reading about work we had never studied before, all these results and equations we were told to use in the experiment, and to be honest, most of the time I had no idea how those equations were derived and sometimes didn't even know what they meant, but you plug in the numbers and get results. A certain amount of ""faith in the work of others"" comes into play, and if that work is complex, and if there isn't the time or interest, and especially if it seems to make sense after a while, there could be mistakes in there and you'd just never know it. It takes someone competent and with the motivation to really dig into the work and check it all out. Remember that science can be very wrong on a subject for a long time before errors and flaws are realized. And sometimes the only reason things change in science when the disagreement isn't so cut and dried as an error in an equation, is because the old guard with a vested interest in that way of doing things, dies out! Also, given the current political push to ""fix the climate"" I dare say that even if a scientist with vested interests did spot such an error, he may not be inclined to point it out. After all, if you believe it, the choice is - keep on helping to save the planet, or point out an error which may help ""the enemy"" who is likely ""working for oil companies"" etc. See what I mean? There are a lot of factors at play here.

Most common scientific measurement for that is called relative humidity. That's the metric used for weather forecast for example. 50% relative humidity = 50% chance of rain tonight. But what you're talking about sounds more like absolute humidity, which is a very different measurement. Absolute humidity is basically how much water vapour there is in the air by volume.

Monckton is saying they are not accounting for that 270 K (or whatever the no water vapour surface temperature would be) to be causing any water vapour to enter the atmosphere. They seem to be assuming that initial temperature causes no water vapour to enter the atmosphere. Why? Probably because the math is a bit complex and if we've buried an error in there and for a long time no one has noticed it, it can be hard to uncover it. The only thing that caused Monckton to suspect something was wrong was that the modles were predicting much more warming than what was being observed, causing Monckton and other scientists to look into it to see iof they could figure out why. According to Monckton, any proper treatment of water vapour feedback estimations would first calculate the amount of water vapour feedback (the amount of water vapour able to be dissolved in the atmosphere without there being any other greenhouse gases present) due to what would be the total temperature if the atmosphere had no greenhouse gases (also meaning - no water vapour). So assuming an atmosphere with just oxygen and nitrogen, you'd have a base temperature value (caused by the sunshine). Then based on that temperature for a dry atmosphere, a certain amount of water vapour could enter the atmosphere, which would then increase the temperature somewhat, which would then increase the amount of water vapour a small amount more, etc. until an equilibrium temperature and amount of water vapour are reached. THEN adding some CO2 greenhouse gas as well, would cause some further warming of the atmosphere, which would cause more water vapour to be dissolved in the atmosphere, so a little bit more warming would result, etc. until a new equilibrium amount of water vapour is present corresponding to the actual temperature we have, which is due to the warming caused by sunshine, CO2 and water vapour in the atmosphere. So this means that the initial temperature causes some water vapour to enter the atmosphere. And then adding some CO2 causes a little more water vapour to enter the atmosphere. Each of which increases the temperature a bit. But according to Monckton this was not what was being done. He says that only the CO2 greenhouse warming change in temperature value was being used (not 270 K but something like 30 K) to account for all the water vapour feedback, so all the water vapour feedback (increase in water vapour) was being attributed to this change in temperature value. Meaning according to him that the 270 K was (in the equations they use) assumed not to cause any water vapour feedback! So all the water vapour in the atmosphere is being generated (he says they assume - probably without realizing their error) by the change in temperature due to greenhouse CO2 in the atmosphere, not the total temperature. Meaning that whether they realized it or not, their calculations assumed the sunshine caused no water vapour to enter the atmosphere, but when the CO2 was added, then THAT greenhouse temperature increase due to CO2 alone, is assumed to account for all the water vapour entering the atmosphere. But that's wrong because even with no CO2, the heat from the sun alone will cause water vapour to enter the atmosphere. So he says they fouled up the water vapour feedback calculations! The takeaway point is - when that mistake is made, the models will over-predict the amount of warming due to water vapour feedback because the models parameters are wrongly tuned, because they are using the wrong temperature term to calculate the amount of water vapour entering the atmosphere due to additional CO2 added. In summary he says that, for a doubling of CO2, instead of expecting to get from say 3.5K to 8K of additional warming, we are instead only going to get around 1K to 1.5K additional warming, which isn't a climate emergency (and may actually be beneficial). But for a more precise explanation (from someone who knows a lot more about it than me!) watch the video links I provided in the other comment. of course, other factors - such as a change in the solar output, or cloud cover, etc. could cause warming (or cooling) that is independent of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.",UCL48KQs7LWlEOSWKA2q8h4w,1,UgzU6h0UBSr0DeEC9514AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Humans reducing the number of trees on Earth does raise the CO2 equilibrium point, the same way humans contributing more and more pollution (actual CO2), raises the CO2 equilibrium point. But eventually there comes a point where humans won't produce more pollution, in fact this will happen as a sudden drop when we run out of fossil fuels. Likewise there is an equilibrium point where humans won't cut down more trees than we grow, which would could be the point where there are so few trees that they're as expensive as gold for example. Remember, my point is that no matter how bad it gets, it must stabilise. It can't simply get worse and worse out of control forever nothing we can do. But I'm not saying it's not going to get worse.

Ok there are 2 halves to your comment. I'll start with the 2nd half first, that the small changes now will have devastating impacts on the environment, which us humans will struggle to adapt to. I don't agree or disagree with this. I have no idea what the impact of climate change will be on us. Take your example of the poor being displaced by rising sea levels, what will happen? Will they become more poor? Will they all die? Will they all turn to anarchy and start attacking the rich? Definite possibilities, but I don't know. And yes the impact on humans could be our extinction or worse. But that wasn't my point. I was talking about negative/positive feedback loops. I'm saying that no matter how much CO2 we contribute, as long as it is a constant amount, there must be an equilibrium point where it is stable, where CO2 doesn't grow or shrink.  In other words, sure, seas and temperature will rise, natural disasters will get worse, but not forever. There will hit a point where the temperature cannot increase further. Maybe after +1° C, maybe 10° C, maybe 100° C. Now to the 1st point half of your comment. There's a difference between the equilibrium level of CO2, and the actual level of CO2. Equilibrium level of CO2 means the level of CO2 which is stable under all planetary forces (including human). A severe drought could cause there to be a temporary spike in CO2, but over the long time the drought fades away, CO2 would go back to the equilibrium which hasn't changed. And after the severe drought(s) you would get more humidity-heavy events like rain and floods, because there is an equilibrium for water as well. The only way you would change the equilibrium for CO2 with droughts is if the planet was on average in a constant state of drought, which defies the definition of being in drought.",UC4ksCts5h9D4kl5cwZ07qcQ,1,UgzU6h0UBSr0DeEC9514AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Yes, shifting equilibrium points are what happens all the tie, or else, we'd be Venus (which was likely caused by catastrophic volcanism, not gradual greenhouse gas heat buildup). Also see Monckton where he points out that humans have been basing their CO2 warming models based on the wrong temperature term. As more CO2 is added it causes additional heating (it's a greenhouse gas) which causes additional water vapour to go into the atmosphere which then causes additional heating (the water vapour feedback). Well guess what? It turns out that (dumb as it may seem in hindsight - but perhaps an error not so easy to spot initially) that the temperature term the modellers were using wasn't the actual temperature of the atmosphere, but an additional warming temperature term due to the presence of greenhouse gases. Meaning that instead of reasoning something like - due to CO2 in the atmosphere the temperature has increased from 270 Kelvin to 300 Kelvin causing increased water vapour to go into the atmosphere, which the - INSTEAD, according to Monckton, they've been arguing (without realizing it) something more like THIS - due to CO2 in the atmosphere we now have a temperature of 30 Kelvin which is causing additional warming due to additional water vapour. See/ They're attributing ALL the additional water vapour feedback to the extra 30 Kelvin of temperature, but NO FEEDBACK from the already existing 270 Kelvin of temperature due to the sun shining! When that is done, the predicted water vapour feedback which loops into everything else is massively exaggerated, causing the models to all predict catastrophic warming (which we haven't seen and won't see). In summary while there is a tiny amount of warming due to additional CO2 being put into the air by humans, it's not much warming, and therefore is nothing to destroy economies and lives over. And certainly no reason to avoid eating meat! In fact it's likely all political in nature, as the arguments to try and curb climate change dovetail precisely with the aims of those who wish to rule the planet and regulate it with an iron fist of control over your life. THAT NEEDS TO BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.

CO2 is very dynamic in our atmosphere, it is depended on various factors and various factors are depended on it. I'll give you a simple human example (although I could think of hundreds of examples), if certain parts of the world are getting warmer (or colder) because of climate change, that is influenced by CO2 levels, humans will use more air conditioning, which then increases electricity demand, which then increases CO2 emissions which in turn causes even more harm to the climate. It's a positive feedback loop in this case. By the way, comparing the atmosphere's CO2 levels millions of years ago to today's levels is completely void of logic and reasoning, life and the planet back then was adapted to those conditions, life today is not, they are uncomparable because of the immense separation in time. At 4000 ppm of CO2, you would die of suffocation within several hours, you would die 400 millions years ago just like most life on earth today, how do you think some mass extinctions happened?

Science is a method for discovering truth/reality. The scientific method is an excellent tool for scientifically confirming hypothesis. Understanding science is understanding logic and reason and identifying evidence that will confirm or disprove whatever hypothesis you care to make. Some hypothesis cannot be confirmed nor falsified such as is there a god. Given that science is a method, it does not take ten years to learn that method. It actually can be understood in very little time at all. Perfecting a technique for employing the scientific method may take slightly longer but anyone with reasonable intelligence can do it. You do not advocate science. You, in fact, advocate the opposite of science. You say go to school for about ten years and acquire a piece of paper and Viola! You are a scientist. A simple test will prove that is NOT how science is conducted. It is simply a colossal waste of time. You could more simply spend ten years employing the scientific method to conduct one experiment after another and achieve a far superior understanding of the natural world. YOU ADVOCATE NOT DOING SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS AT ALL BUT INSTEAD YOU ADVOCATE JUST BELIEVING WHATEVER SOMEONE WITH A PIECE OF PAPER SAYS. Not only that, the someone ought to be in the news or in a text book. Not one thing in the world could be further away from science than that.

Faced with ongoing catastrophic fires, and the certainty that they will only worsen in the future, California finally demonstrates some common sense. Without admitting that they were wrong, and actually the cause of the conditions that have resulted in the catastrophic fire threat, California Governor Jerry Brown has relaxed logging restrictions “to mitigate climate change fire risk.” Somehow CO2 prevented California from thinning our their forests and maintaining healthy and safe conditions. Timber industry officials say the changes are needed to cut red tape and increase incentives for landowners, particularly in the Sierra Nevada, to thin pine and fir forests that have become dangerously overgrown after 100 years of fire fighting. (Source) “I’ve heard the climate change argument back and forth,” Zinke told Sacramento-based KCRA. “This has nothing to do with climate change. This has to do with active forest management.” Many of California’s forests are overgrown, some areas with 10 times the number of trees than the space can support. Historically, wildfires were a staple through the California landscape, popping up about every decade and burning through excess fuel while leaving the oldest, healthiest trees to continue growing, The Mercury News reports. In recent decades, fire suppression has taken priority over active land management, allowing fuel to build up.

You created three ""non - senses"" out of one. Here is what you do not get: Scientism is relatively new to our society. It is the notion that ""scientist say"" therefore it is true. This is wrong on many levels but to be brief I will mention two. What ""scientist say"" is ""filtered"" by a few people aka mainstream media/official public education etc. That is to say a few people decide what ""scientist say"" and distribute it to those mediums. For the first time since the dark ages, these ""pronouncements"" are declared to be the official stance of scientist and therefore they must be true and to deny these pronouncement is to deny science itself. The obvious logical fallacy is an appeal to authority. The population is being so completely dumbed down they really have no choice but to accept what ""scientist say."" Also, for the first time in some time folks who also happen to be scientist but disagree with the official pronouncements are finding themselves without a job. Those who speak out against these official pronouncements are now being threatened with lawsuits and even jail. This is our new world of scientism in a nutshell. It is also serving to replace any and all religion. It is thought that scientism can solve all of man's problems given enough time. Of course anything built on a lie can solve nothing but that it is a lie is denied and anyone claiming it is a lie is a heretic. We basically can no longer debate the science. We either agree with the official pronouncements or suffer the consequences. Of course ""peer review"" is supposed to save the day but it has the exact same constraints though it is claimed to be ""pure"" science. Another total lie. So, you have accepted the idea of scientism and you use the false premise of ""look at all the advancement scientism has made. You cannot deny its efficacy!"" Which of course is a classic straw man argument. CAGW is a TOTAL LIE! It is UNTRUE! AND THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! Yet! Scientism makes even debating it a sin! Now, skinner's box. The same people who have dumb'ed the population down and who is selling them on scientism is creating a virtual surveillance state. The result will be absolute control.

Both are trapped in a huge global game of ""whack-a-mole"". The IPCC stated that population and GDP are the biggest drivers of global warming. Global Warming or global mass extinction isn't even the worst problem, extreme global water scarcity is! ""Cowspiracy"" is pseudo-science money scam filled with mistruth and narrow-minded vegan ""moral superiority"" prejudice. There is lots of sugar, carbohydrates and starch in vegan diets so vegan diets aren't 100% healthy. Vegans and the media love to dumb down the facts and bash poor farmers, yet farms account for only maybe 10% of greenhouse gases. Most greenhouse gases come from the cities. Americans use five times more energy and resources and have an astronomical amount of national debt compared to other countries. CO2 lasts in the atmosphere about 300 years, methane lasts about 15 years in the atmosphere. There is about 4000 times more CO2 in the atmosphere than methane. Electric motors aren't the ""be all and end all"" technology than the elitist regressive Left and the technocratic crony capitalist controlled media wants you to believe. Algae farms are being researched for food, biofuel, bioreactors, building materials, ink, textiles/clothes, space exploration science projects, cleaner waterways, CO2 recapture, and to replace over 900 fossil fuel based products. Algae is nature's greenhouse filter and provide about 50% of the world's photosynthesis. Support our important agricultural industry so important for every country's financial future and national security. It is critical for our own best interests to develop back up alternative power and food supplies, and avoid ""greenwash"" industry monopolies. What is everyone's problem and what is wrong with them? Everyone is pretending to be someone they are not, and underneath is it just sad!

Mostly effected by the sun, but to a much smaller extent, the increase in cities/populations can and do have some affect. Steel, stone, concrete and asphalt used in construction for buildings, roads, and other construction, retain heat from the sun’s energy during the day and dissipate that heat during the cooler hours. While attending the University of Arizona, during the early 1970’s, many “climatologists, meteorologists, scientists and other weather ‘experts’” were hysterically protesting and demonstrating (while professing) that we were entering another ICE-AGE. We obviously were not entering an ice-age then, and are not suffering “global warming” now. These are political hoaxes to attempt to separate your money from your wallet. Former Vice President Al Gore predicted that within ten years the oceans would rise about twenty feet. That was ten years ago and so far they have not risen even inch. Nothing, no, Nada not even a mili-meter! Let us use some common sense: Fact 1: Humans can not change (or make) the weather, we cannot even accurately predict it much less change it. Maybe we can seed a cloud here or there, but we can not stop or change the direction of a tornado or a hurricane or even a thunder storm or cold front or any other weather phenomenon. Fact 2: The air we breath (the Earth’s atmosphere) is made-up of about 77% Nitrogen, 22% Oxygen, and less than 1% argon. That leaves LESS than 1% of ALL OTHER GASSES and airborne materials (such as water vapor, dust, etc). Carbon Dioxide makes up less than 2/100’s of one percent of Earth’s atmosphere. Like spitting into the ocean, not enough to make ANY difference no matter how many times we spit. Fact 3: Global warming “experts” say that animal (primarily cow) flatulence (FARTS) help to increase the threat of global warming. Cow flatulence are NOT Carbon Dioxide. Like most animal flatulence, that gas is a methane gas NOT C02. If you are one of those people falling for this hoax, I live in Arizona and I do have some beach front property for sale here.

With so many cows, you also get a lot of cow dung, farts, etc, all of which have methane. I'm fuzzy on this, but from what I remember methane has a higher greenhouse effect on large numbers than other gases. This would be bad already, but it gets worse because the more methane is released into the environment, the warner it gets, and that melts permafrost in areas like Siberia, which of course have massive stores of methane. It's too late because...it's already starting to melt. So technically, not eating meat would reduce the demand for livestock and ultimately reduce the methane they produce. But that's a bit unrealistic to ask of people in certain areas. With lab-grown meat, however, you wouldn't need to stop eating meat, and could probably by a cut of meat made a certain way (more fat, or higher density). Long story short, meat animals release harmful gases, so not eating meat over time will reduce the need for them, so people will raise less of them and less of those gases will be released. Or we should switch to lab-grown meat.",UC0nR4kWZtdStwAp2CCOzzMQ,1,UgzU6h0UBSr0DeEC9514AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

In the US most feed for cows and pigs and chicken is primarily corn based. Think about a field of corn, one field of corn takes a LOT of space and a lot of water (costs money and electricity ie CO2 to move it around) and a lot of farming equipment (burning gas) and chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers that disrupt already weakened ecosystems). So we have this huge carbon investment where we're making all this food for livestock. The problem is that livestock have generally a 10:1 ratio for weight of food in vs weight of food out. In essence every 10 kilograms of corn you feed a cow you get one kilogram of steak. Think about how wasteful that is, 1 kilogram of steak is roughly 2000 Kcal of food, so like one day but 10kilos of corn is nearly 10,000 Kcal of energy or 5 days of food (roughly). In addition storing and preserving plant based food is much easier and less prone to food safety problems making it easier to grow food in one area and then distribute it around the world. To move a steak from texas to NYC you need refrigerated trucks and food safety inspectors. To move dried or canned corn to NYC you can put it in an un-climate controlled truck and as long as it doesn't get wet keeps for like 2 years.",UCBv_0cDqtniHdSRLF4I6q5A,1,UgzU6h0UBSr0DeEC9514AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Basically, as you may have heard before, it creates a sort of ""blanket"" in the atmosphere that traps the Sun's heat. And we're pumping metric tons of it into the atmosphere every day. That lag you've seen in previous records is due to CO2 in glaciers and the ground being released into the atmosphere over time, but that CO2 does lead to more warming due to it's ""blanket"" property of trapping heat.

Atmospheric CO2 has been >4000 ppmv over last 550,000,000 years. There were no polar ice caps (also the present continents didn't exist for most of that time you are referring to). Great uncertainty due to being so very long ago but likely ~1,500 to ~2,000 ppmv from 250,000,000 to 100,000,000 years ago so nothing soaring much above 2,000 ppmv over the extremely recent past of the last 1/4 of a billion (that's with a ""b"") years. From 53,000,000 years ago to just 5,000,000 years ago the atmospheric CO2 did plunge back down from ~1,000 ppmv to ~300 ppmv over an eye blink of just ~48,000,000 years as you've typed (""still capable of returning to the low CO2 level we are at now"") as the Himalayas & Tibetan Plateau were pushed up & rock weathering increased, and ""life much better than it does now"" also correct.

The main problem here, and not refering to you, (I´m Spanish, so maybe I write something wrongly, sorry), is the fact that the worst enemy Earth has is human IGNORANCE. It´s taken to the disaster we have today and it´s the worst thing that is stopping us to do right the things we know are wrong. Ignorant people listening to ignorant anothers in some cases and, the worst, listening to very clever greedy ones in anothers. Earth is very complex, there are tons of factors which are not able to be calculated by the best supercomputers we have. But we know lots of things we are doing wrong but do nothing or little to fix them. I studied Environmental Science at university, so I have some ideas about this, but always know that I know nothing, then I listen to scientific comunity, scientific data, instead of digesting infomercials and taking own conclusions as many readers do. As Earth is so complex we can´t just take one simple solution or one simple thing to fix, because there are tons of them that interactuate each others. So when I find someone who says ""the solution to Climate Change is blablabla"" it´s probably a hoax because there are lots of solutions to be working together and solutions that we must be sure they will not generate secondary effects in other ways. To me, sincerely, it´s not time to waste time here knocking the keyboards trying to convince ignorants about how real Climate Change is because it´s taking us nowhere and wasting our preciated time TO ACTUATE. It´s time to DO THINGS, not to talk. If there are people outthere who don´t believe the ice is melting, species are dissapearing, temperature is rising, etc etc etc... what more can we do than Ignorate them? we must listen to scientific comunity and do constructive things. if there are still people who think diesel doesn´t produce cancer by NOx, plastics are killing Nature, or have no idea about where electricity comes from and what it generates on Earth, and after explaining them things on scientific fundamentals still keep on saying it´s a hoax... it´s a waste of time paying attention to them. Of course... when it´s about a president of a country, then... it´s a huge problem. (As we´ve had here in Spain). My position about Meat. I wrote about it yesterday. I think occidental population has a big health problem: very high meat consumption. But it doesn´t mean I should say ""don´t eat meat"". And I´m talking about meat in it´s extension, not just cows. In my personal case: I eat something like just one cow steak per month... don´t think even two in the highest case. But I do take other protein sources that my body needs like Fish, Pig, Chicken, though actually I´m taking a very high vegetable diet. (Mainly because, though I practice much sports I have genetic high cholesterol tendency). (Actually even milk and milky products in very low consumption level). So the solution is not to go from deforesting to farm huge amounts of cows to nothing. It would be another discussion to estimate how bad it would be if we all were Vegan then ""our so terrific"" cows will have no predators/competence... ummm... BIO tendency. Like all tendencies it always have too much about snobism. It´s stupid to go to the supermarket and see shelves full of BIO products when what you have is a lot of plastic covering them and too far away origins. (It´s a fact that harving respecting the ecosystem as much as possible generates a more constant production in time, though smaller, but without highs and lows like intensive one. So that´s the way to go.) In my opinion, if I was at the top of the world at the ONU or stuff like that... I would inmediately start TEACHING PEOPLE (we have wonderful ways to do it today). Not by me, but the most relevant scientifics on each country. What would I push to teach? ECOLOGY, with any doubt. At the time people in mass will arrive to understand about Energy, Matter and how they work on Earth I´m sure they will automatically start doing steps on the right way. Because that´s what Earth needs from us, DOING STEPS INMEDIATELY. We have no rights to kill Life on Earth. ANY. People will ask for dramatic solutions when things will go worst. And I would ask them then: what did you do when the scientific comunity advised you several times your egoism and the things you were doing will lead you to a catastrophic point? KILLING OURSELVES? NOT THE WAY. It´s a coward way. The brave way is to find solutions that allow us to coexist on Earth for a long time. If I kill my self now thinking I will cut the contamination I generate I will go wrong. Why? BECAUSE I WILL HAVE LOST THE CHANCE TO TEACH PEOPLE THINGS TO FIX. AND BECAUSE I WILL HAD STOP THE CHANCE OF FIGHTING AGAINST ""EARTH KILLERS"" as I do. I wouldn´t be able to go on planting the hundreds of trees I´m doing. I won´t be able to teach my nephews about living respecting the place we live in (a very important key: the next generation education)... Superpopulation is a big problem society must realize have to fix and find ways to do it. But no matter how many we are as a whole because just one occidental person contaminates more than lots of people from other places. So we can´t avoid to admit our responsibilities and the big role we play as individuals who make a big whole. How much are we able to SACRIFICE? Do we really need to travel around the world to be happy? Can we try to go by bike or foot instead of using the car? Why don´t we consume Local products? Why don´t we say NO to plastic overuse when we go to the mall? etc etc etc etc... WE ARE NATURE. WE ARE PART OF IT. IF WE DESTROY IT, WILL BE DESTROYING OURSELVES. If someone thinks it´s a political religion or stuff like that... all I can is...

Then the meat is transported from the slaughter house to the factory actually producing the food you're eating, this might in some cases involve several factories and several stages.

The level of the lake can stay constant even with different forces acting on it (like the terminal velocity in your analogy, but that only has two forces that constant or heavily bounded in our world). Even small changes will change the equilibrium level, and big changes like a dam or a drought can have massive, irreversible impacts. To suggest that with this simple model the world would either be frozen (lets say zero CO2 in your analogy) or baking hot (infinity CO2 in your analogy, which doesn't make physical sense at all btw) is reduction to the absurd. The bottom line is that the world is quite different than at points in the distant path, how we got from there to here was natural feedback mechanisms over millions and billions of years, but humans have made measurable changes over a very very short period of time. If we change the temperature by even a few degrees, it can have a huge impact on the oceans, jet stream, water cycle, sea level etc. that the planet would survive and adapt to, but humans would struggle to adapt to. Just imagine the number of people who live in poverty and within 5 miles of the ocean or 50 feet from sea level. If they start being displaced, what impact will that have on humanity? How will we keep ourselves healthy and safe even if we are not affected? (which we will be because the food system will be disrupted by climate, disease and desertification).",UCIVpjuhn4-V60oY8oH_QQCw,1,UgzU6h0UBSr0DeEC9514AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

As the climate gets warmer, rainfall increases and so does erosion and weathering. This acts as a negative feedback, although on a significantly longer timescale than humans are emitting CO2. Thus if anthropogenic CO2 emissions stopped now and never resumed, processes like silicate weathering would, over many hundreds of years, draw CO2 out of the atmosphere. I have heard it theorised that without anthropogenic emissions, this process would aid in transitioning towards another ice age, but with human emissions, the next ice age has likely been delayed for thousands of years. Eventually, human CO2 emissions must slow down and cease, even assuming we survive the next 1000 years, because fossil fuels are finite in quantity, and once they are gone, we have to move on to renewable (and low carbon) energy sources.",UCL-VKI5Sg6Cv5nSl2rhU72w,1,UgzU6h0UBSr0DeEC9514AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Since he's the go to man, figured I should repost his reply and mine for honesty's sake. Simon Clark Because it's not that simple - there are both positive and negative feedback loops. For example more CO2 -> warmer, wetter planet -> more photosynthesis from plants -> less CO2. But then at the same time more CO2 -> warmer, wetter planet -> more water vapour absorbing thermal wavelengths of radiation -> warmer planet. There are feedback loops all over the place, hence the need for complicated models! Zacharie Etienne Holy shit a reply from the man himself!! If there are both positive and negative feedback loops - that only means they would either cancel each other out, or they average out into one positive feedback loop, or a negative one. If it's positive or negative, the Earth would've been screwed from the get go regardless of humans. Therefore, when there's no human input, the Earth's CO2 levels must be self correcting , i.e. when CO2 levels are too high, the negative feedback loops have more punch, and when CO2 is too low, the positive feedback loops win over. Only this scenario would create an equilibrium allowing CO2 levels to remain stable over time, any other scenario would have CO2 levels spiral exponentially to either 0 or infinity due to effects of chaos. And if that's the case, then while an additional human input of CO2 will produce a temporary rise in temperature, eventually we will again find a natural equilibrium, because although we've increased the CO2 levels, because we've done that, the net negative feedback loops will become more pronounced, while the net positive feedback loops will diminish, and (as long as human CO2 input is constant), they'll be a point where the loops once again reach equilibrium. I can make an analogy with air resistance vs gravity. As you know, falling objects have air resistance, and the faster the velocity, the more air resistance. Therefore this is an example of a negative feedback loop, because if a falling object momentarily goes faster than the terminal velocity where air resistance and gravity are in equilibrium, then the object slows back down to terminal velocity. Likewise, if the object momentarily goes slower than the terminal velocity, gravity win over the air resistance, creating a positive feedback loop, and making the object speed back to terminal velocity. Any other universe where the object didn't have a positive feedback loop when going to slow AND a negative feedback loop when going to fast, would inevitably result in the object either coming to a complete stop or speeding up indefinitely. Now in this analogy, human input of CO2 is equivalent to reducing the object's surface area. By doing so, you'll have decreased the force of air resistance, making the object fall faster/have a higher terminal velocity. But the same positive/negative feedback loops apply, so although the object will temporarily fall faster, it will inevitably reach a new terminal velocity again, where the feedback loops cancel out and it's all ok.",UC4ksCts5h9D4kl5cwZ07qcQ,1,UgzU6h0UBSr0DeEC9514AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Big companies need the most resources and make up the biggest polluters, so local and smaller is better.<br /><br />4) universal basic income so people dont have &quot;to make a living&quot; at any cost and follow their passions- no damaging, stupid or unnecessary work<br /><br />5) make hemp biodiesel (and other biodiesels) make up 30% of all fuel compulsory in the economy and make investments. Tackle food waste and make it maximal 5% of all produced. Go towards 0% fossil fuels with improved technology. Swap most plastics for hemp-derived materials<br /><br />6) sustainability index- make an index of the worst environmental offender-practices. Ban those that are not needed and bring within limits those that can be made sustainable. Use taxes to incentivize/disincentivize<br /><br />7) go towards a bio-adapted infrastructure such as passages for the wild under highways and so forth. Go back to natural farming, drop all intensive farming, is healthier anyway. Decrease production of animal products. Abandon chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides, all not sustainable. <br /><br />8) we need a working UN back in some form, to protect areas such as the amazonas and other strategically important parts of the world for the ecology. Besides that we need first nation countries to invest in countries that are lagging behind, as the investment would yield much greater results.

As carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases are added, this amplifies the greenhouse effect which further raises temperatures. Besides hiking evaporation rates, the warmer air is able to hold additional water vapor. Warmer global temperatures, also, ramps up the rate at which permafrost and oceanic hydrates melt, thus releasing more and more ‘methane’. This further amplifies the greenhouse effect and increases temperatures that again, in turn, causes increased levels of evaporation and melting.

First, every quarter century, fools like Trump or Bolsanero come along & allow their cronies to cut down what you've planted. See what's done to Bialowiecsa Forest, Poland by the PiS government. Woods are on fertile soil, timber is value, even stabile govt can't keep it safe- even swedish old growth is dwindling. More important, there's simply not enough open land to plant them co2 Capture trees. Farm folk live there, if not, it's already forest or it's unfertile or too dry. Greenpeace calculated about 2 times the surface of india is needed for current offset schemes using trees. We don't have that kind of empty land surface. Third, emissions are enormous. The average Car drive of 10-12 miles emits ca. 2 kilo CO2 gas, about 1m3. To reduce 1 cubic meter to 1ppm, you need 1 million m3 of air, that's twice the payload of a major container ship, for reducing one commute emission to one lousy ppm. 400 of those rides, doubles the CO2 content in 2 big container ships, or equals the emissions of a single flight, or about 30 cubic feet of cement concrete.

The answer is that the light coming into the atmosphere is composed of different wavelengths to that which is leaving the atmosphere: light from the sun is full of short wavelengths (like UV) while light from the earth is full of long wavelengths (infrared). This is basically because the sun is much hotter than the earth. And CO2 only absorbs long wavelengths of light (in a certain spread of wavelengths, specifically), while not absorbing short wavelengths like those from the sun. This is because of the way the CO2 molecule is built. I hope this helps!",UCRRr_xrOm66qaigIbwFLvbQ,1,UgwzPcEXNRgrsS-LOY14AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The only part which can have that is in being alive. Non-experience, non-pain, is always neutral state. You can't lose with that. Likewise, you might be thinking, 'well, then you can't win either!'. Yes, that may be true, if you think pleasure is _winning_ , but if you realize pain to less pain creates the illusion of a reward through relief, then you will realize 'the game' is duped and we're not playing any important role, at all, that I am aware of. It's all cyclic. Anything we believe is of urgency or purpose, is designed to keep us to fight for our survival and continual reproduction, because that's what DNA does best. It's physics. Nothing _wrong_ with that, but that's what it is. Most people probably won't wanna play after they realize it, so don't. Just step outside of ego and want, and the void will be open. The fear of the unknown keeps us from it. Obviously, since those are the main mechanics of our motivation, you can't step out, without being dead. There's no reason to rush the process, just flow. Your trip will come. Don't get too attached, if ya don't wanna wake up here, again.

How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) As human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime.

And I'm not sure you can get the world's population to adapt to even 50% of what in on the list in any event. And this list does not address the problem of China and India. These two countries are building coal fired power plants as fast as they can, and they are both competing in the world market with the US. There is no way the US is going to spend the kind of money we need to to get to zero carbon and then watch China and India take away a bunch of business from us because they have a huge energy cost advantage. And unless you can get China and India in line with this program, everything everyone else does will be wasted. Yet China and India are smart enough to know that you cannot expand your grid with wind/solar, they are unreliable sources of energy.

Stopping all economic activity is a straw man, but we do need a fundamentally different economy and fundamentally different lifestyles to secure the survival of humanity, and there are actually hundreds of solutions for cutting CO2 by 75%, starting with reduced consumption of both energy and material goods, and then reducing global trade and this Earth-destroying way we make things like tennis shoes. After that, here are 80 of the best researched ways of drawing down atmospheric CO2 levels (we have to reverse warming and to do that, we need to REDUCE atmospheric CO2 levels): https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank The book that grew out of this research project is fascinating. However, in the past, increased efficiency seems to have fueled further consumption of energy, and we have to put an absolute lid on carbon emissions just as a family would put an absolute lid on spending. It's worth noting that when a group of five retired GOP senators and five retired DEM senators were put together on a task force to solve America's biggest problems, one of their solutions was a gas tax of 10 more cents every year, ending up at around $1 more a gallon.

This rush to net zero in 30 years is a total joke, it will never happen unless there is a huge technology breakthrough very soon. You do realize that because wind/solar are undependable sources of energy, the highest they can ever get is 25% (24 hour basis, isolated grid with no ability to buy and sell power in/out of the grid in question). If not nuclear, where are the other 50-75% of the power going to come from? Hydroelectric is great, but there are only so many rivers to dam up, so that is capped at about 10%. Any method of storage is way too costly to store enough power to light up the entire US East coast for more than about one minute.

After overestimating climate sensitivity to CO2 in the late 1970s, climate scientists have it figured out quite well now, and their models have been quite accurate, and we know that our burning fossil fuels offset the cooling that should have occurred plus created all recent global warming (whether you look at the last 65 years or the past 150, all net global warming was due to us burning fossil fuels [with a helping hand from deforestation]). How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures predict global warming with reasonable accuracy. 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures find that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime.

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth&#39;s overall temperature 800 years ago. World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to &quot;fight&quot; climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle. The following is the source of this information:<br /><br />Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core<br /><br />Investigators<br />J.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius<br />Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l&#39;Environnement,<br />CNRS, BP96,<br />38402 Saint Martin d&#39;Heres Cedex, France<br /><br />N.I. Barkov<br />Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute,<br />Beringa Street 38, 199397,<br />St. Petersburg, Russia<br /><br />Period of Record<br />417,160 - 2,342 years BP<br /><br />Methods<br />In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the &quot;Grenoble analytical setup,&quot; which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).<br /><br />Trends<br />There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.<br /><br />References<br />Barnola, J.-M., D.

Put 66 million large herbivores in America, Asia, and Africa respectively and we are still 800 million short of the number of cattle we have on Earth today. There are just TOO MANY CATTLE (plus sheep and goats) to keep Earth's ecosystems viable long term. They just take up too much land, and if people ate must less meat, 70% of the deforestation that has happened in the Amazon would never have happened because our more plant-based diets wouldn't have created any demand-side pressure to chop down/burn rainforests to graze cattle or grow cattle feed. I've watched Joel talk--interesting guy, but he tends to talk about isolated patches of land and doesn't REALLY reason globally. Yes, it will be great when our population goes down, but it is what it is, and if you have to choose between and vegan/almost vegan diet or a typical (not even high meat) diet that uses FIVE TIMES as much land to feed a person, only one end of that continuum is feasible on a planet of this size. We don't have to ""hope"" the wilderness isn't exploited by people: If we sharply reduce meat consumption (and palm oil too) we simply have no reason to chop down all that rainforest. Then enact tough laws to protect them, but that's easier when you aren't working against the profit motive from Big Meat.

Remember that prior to human agriculture vast plains in Asia, Africa and America were grazed by enormous herds of herbivores. Buffalo in America numbered in the tens of millions. Today we still see this play out in east Africa. Watch Joel Salatin {on YT} talk about this at length. Secondly, we cannot expect people to allow forests to grow unmolested. We can see what is happening to the Amazon. Where food is being grown and the land properly managed, this will be of greater benefit than hoping lands left to wilderness will not be exploited by people. I have a personal prejudice against wheat though I know it feeds a lot of people. I also believe animal derived foods are an important part of our diet. Of course a reduction in human population is the real solution.",UCoIZLB1bKAxKjyz_KGQEjww,1,UgxmidvJKZMeFGoKuZp4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Basically, to save the Earth, people have to start eating a LOT LESS beef, lamb, and goat meat. We need to do much more than that, but there's no way to get our economy/way of life within the Earth's limits without cutting down on beef. Beef is just an incredibly and unsustainably wasteful way to get calories and nutrients. In terms of land use, wheat is 25x more efficient for providing protein than beef/lamb are, and pulses/legumes are 100 TIMES more efficient. (For providing calories, the advantages of plants are even greater). So the reality is that the only way we can get the greenhouse gases problem under control and save the planet is for people to sharply reduce beef consumption. Here's media coverage of two very large studies published in top scientific journals in 2018 basically reaching that conclusion: https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/11/save-planet-climate-catastrophe-new-study-says-put-down-damn-meat https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/save-planet-meat-dairy-livestock-food-free-range-steak For some simple charts showing just how wasteful and unsustainable beef consumption is, see https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets As you can see from chart 2, if everyone the way Americans did, we'd need 2.7 times more agricultural land than we are using now, and that's more habitable land than even exists on the Earth. Similar patterns hold true for other developed nations--are diets are one big part of what's destroying the health and livability of the planet, and cutting down on beef consumption is the #1 most impactful act people can do to help the situation. Also, it's well-established that eating a plant-based diet kills fewer animals than raising animals does, and more broadly speaking, eating plants uses far less of the Earth's land, meaning less deforestation and loss of biodiversity, less global warming, less and smaller dead zone and toxic algae blooms. So, yes, WHERE beef is raised, it should be grown using the managed grazing methods that sequester more carbon than do lousy grazing methods. However, forests sequester VASTLY more carbon than do grazing lands of fields of livestock feed (and are far better for biodiversity and ecosystem health). So if people worldwide sharply reduced meat consumption (or went vegan), we could reforest an area the size of the US, ultimately sequestering hundreds of billions of tons of CO2. Thus, after having fewer children, reducing beef and lamb consumption is the next most beneficial thing you can do for cooling the planet and healing Earth’s ecosystems.

Co2 as having impact on the greenhouse effect was disproved in the 1900 by Knut Angstrom. It wasn&#39;t again taken seriously until the late 20th century when the co2 rose. Co2 rose but temperatures have never followed. We should have evidence of temps going beyond the cyclical variance seen over the history of the earth. However, we don&#39;t.

How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) As human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All recent warming and climate disruption is due to us burning fossil fuels. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards the degradation and then collapse of ecosystems and thus the collapse of ecosystems, and thus the collapse of our food supply, society, and population. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage).

You did go over what to do as a person, and yes being aware of your implementations on the environment is important, but there are countries that are producing a lot of Co2 such as, China, USA(mainly Military), and India. Climate change is a political question and always will be due to the fact that it can cut into a countries GDP heavy such as China. China will most likely never try and reduce carbon emissions because they are getting a huge amount of money form production, and manufacturing. USA is quite suborn with a strong military and thus will have a hard time lowering carbon emissions, and India is the same with china. You sort of glanced over renewable energy which I can under stand why you did not put much effort into discussing it or if the main point of the video was on the Co2 extraction machine. Although renewable energy is almost a complete scam. Solar panels use extremely toxic materials inside of them for the chemical to electrical process and have a life span of about 10-20 years and the toxic waste is essentially unusable. Wind turbines are expensive while also taking up a huge amount of land to make a wind farm. Also wind farms have been know to kill birds indiscriminately. Hydroelectric dams also emit methane from there reservoirs with decay plants and animals. We need to stop pushing the false products that will end up doing more damage than good and find a better solution. You did mention that in the year 3000 the radioactivity of nuclear waist is reduced by 3000x which is a great point that i would move into. Nuclear energy is possibly our greatest option for our energy crisis, besides fusion reactors, where the nuclear waste is the largest issue. <br /><br /><br />I hope that some people will read this brick of text and learn or question something about the topic of climate change and it would be amazing if this comment got pinned.<br />For clarification I am not insulting Simon Clark or anyone.",UC2I8w35fIR4S5fIBp-giBPw,0,Ugyr_9KLQZoSlbJIX_N4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Keep reading, you might find this highly interesting. <br /><br />First off, there will come a day where biblical prophesy tells us that the earth will eventually come to the point of cataclysmic destruction. During this event, something really good happens! all evil will come to and end, and those found worthy will find eternal solace in a utopia beyond their wildest imagination. For every negative, there is also a positive.

Now water weight displacement from arctic Ice Melt and more ice piling up in the Antarctic, which will inevitably cause more continental plate shifting (Land weight displacement from earthquakes with magnitudes well beyond what we&#39;ve ever before heard or witnessed) <br /><br />There&#39;s more to come! with further increased axis tilt, Windage will increase beyond imagination, so great (earth spins at just over 1000 mph) in magnitude, the sheer wind speed creates friction heat which further increases wind speed (imagine the space shuttle entering earths atmosphere and greater) causing such a fervent heat will burn all surface elements down to it&#39;s carbon state, leveling every hill and every mountain with not one grain of sand left standing. <br /><br />&quot;But the day of the Lord will come like a thief.

Global warming is the subject you have to use if you talk about carbon emissions and the whole process around it. Climate change is the subject you use if you are talking about the causes and effects of global warming which is rising of sea levels, the impact on ecosystems, hurricanes, tornados, changing entire climates,... Global warming first, then climate change. Climate change is irreversible I agree on that since the causes and effects have already happened or are happening. Global warming is reversible by reducing carbon emissions, but most scientist are aware that global warming is irreversible as well since humanity is NOT succeeding in taking drastic measures to save the biosystems. Not because the tools and ideas are there, but because of the essence of humanity itself. Humanity is a vile hypocritical being that only leeches. There is no such thing as a collective hive. Humanity is selfish, ignorant, fools that only think about their selves. And thus global warming will keep occurring. Earth will end up having the same effect that Venus its atmosphere has, basically a big thick atmosphere filled with greenhouse gases which makes it extremely hot with no chance of life at all. Earth will go through that process as well. It will end up having a similar case as Venus but will then slowly gradually get out of the irreversible loop that Venus has. By then of course humanity and other sentient species will be already dead. I’m talking about this century and the 2 centuries next to come. By god, I hope your ideas you present in your video about the nuclear waste is true, but just imagine how it would fuck up everything if the climate is going through some bad shit. That scientist of yours is bit optimistic, but she is not facing the reality of the fact that carbon emissions still keep rising. Her data needs to be updated. But besides that, you made the video on 2018. Now it is 2019 September. The scientist her paper is from 6-7 years ago? Why didn&#39;t you used scientific research of 2017 - 2018?

Climate could have changed before without us and we could change the climate too, couldn't we ? The best example of our ""might"" is what we are doing to the climate, but as you don't believe we are having that much of an impact, I'll just say that life, in all photosynthetic forms, has made very important changes (for example, almost all the rocks with oxygen come from the oxygen of the atmosphere which comes from photosynthesis). So why couldn't we be able to impact the Earth ? And what you said about the dinosaurs is right and wrong : One of the five great extinctions (the permian one) is thought to have been caused by massive eruptions (which released CO2) which change the climate rapidly. So yes, fast climate change can be bad for life. And if you don't care about that, I don't what to say. As for the Earth, it doesn't care.

They complain because the current phenomena is understood to be caused by humanity and is threatening the livelihood of people as well as the ecosystem. For instance, the reduced ice in the Arctic has allowed for the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic to push farther north and shifted the arctic winds over Canada to push farther south to more habitated areas periodically, resulting in the ""polar vortex."" For a second example, in Cambodia droughts that are believed to be caused by climate change threaten the livelihood of fisherman who live and work in the country's delta. More sporadic rainfall has resulted in lower water levels to the point where even in the rainy season regions that are supposed to flood are bone dry, except in the occurence of floods. This means severe economic losses for the nation and the likely relocation of tens of thousands of workers within an impoverished region. And don't get me started on the Pacific nations that have swaths of territory vulnerable to rising sea levels. You might think that the environmental movement is all about primitivism and ""save the whales,"" but honestly that's not the reason that almost every nation on earth has declared it to be a problem. It's because billions of lives and trillions of dollars might be lost if nothing is done. Perhaps I should've used a different analogy; cancer has always existed, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't stop smoking. But that's just me.

Assuming 10¢/kWh, that means the theoretical minimum <b>cost</b> of carbon capture is $10/tCO2. The problem is that CO2 is so diffuse in the atmosphere that you have to process a huge amount of air in order to capture a ton of CO2, so most proposed systems sacrifice a significant amount of operating efficiency to keep the capital cost manageable. For instance, you don&#39;t need as much surface area for absorbing CO2 if you increase the flow rate of air over a smaller surface area using a fan, however; operating that fan uses more energy. So, sadly; no the cost of CO2 capture can&#39;t fall by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude.<br /><br />Unless of-course you had some sort of magical CO2 capturing system combined with a factory that used solar energy to capture CO2 AND build more of itself out of that CO2!

We need to plant more greenery and allow the ecosystem a chance to actually work like it is supposed to instead of increasing carbon emissions and decreasing plant life. The oceans are also extremely important for oxygen production and yet we continue to defile those. Unfortunately humanity has no hope in uniting with people like Donald trump, who literally does not believe in climate change or pretends not to, leading. He appointed somebody who doesn’t believe in the environmental preservation cause as head of the environmental department, this stripping the apartment of the ability to combat the issue. Despite numerous warnings over the years, even from brilliant minds like Stephen hawking, thousands of experts in the field, and public faces like Harrison Ford, people continue not to care. It’s because humans don’t see threats that aren’t imminent, but this is the biggest most imminent threat we will face. Lastly, I’d like to direct you to Ecosia, a search engine which uses its profits to plant trees. With more greenery we will be able to reduce the amount of carbon. But another thing that is important is the increase of certain microscopic underwater populations which have the ability to suck carbon out of the atmosphere at an astounding rate. Until we have good, thoughtful leaders who care about the future of our planet and people willing to unite against the issue, we are completely and utterly doomed. If we continue like this without action, I wouldn’t be surprised if the predictions of the ocean going empty and the amazon rainforest converting to a desert (desertification is a HUGE issue) within the next 100 years come true. If the global temperature rises a little more, we will lose huge coastal cities, which results in more crowded populations and loss of tons of money, business, and houses (we better not lose universal studios man). There is a slight chance that the temperatures will rise even more, resulting in the land being completely covered over and the extinction of the human race. Even if this doesn’t happen in our generation, we want to build a good chance for the future of our species. It is saddening to think about, and often difficult to go about our every day lives with this knowledge, but we just have to keep living with the time we have and hope that we can find a way to unite against this global threat. If anyone has ever read the Watchmen, I don’t think bringing in some sort of imminent global threat to unite the earth would be such a bad idea right about now. Hopefully we can decrease carbon emissions for the future and use this technology to decrease the amount of carbon.

While there is increased growth in their weather-controlled hermetically-sealed greenhouses as CO2 levels increase, in much higher concentrations the plants do die. Energy consumption dramatically increases as CO2 levels increase to maintain constant temperature/humidity levels, and oxygen masks are provided to researchers that enter these sealed greenhouses as concentrations above 500ppmv is considered to be toxic to humans (according to this study's safety procedures). Unfortunately, I can't provide you an online source for these current results as it's part of a restricted journal, with the full public report expected to be released in the next couple of years. By the way, the computer performance required to calculate the variables you have identified simultaneously is beyond what any supercomputer is capable of processing. Unfortunately, with traditional statistical analysis (aka what every ""skeptic"" relies on) is not capable of even processing let alone representing the results expected.

When looked into the child would be persuaded (as they all are eventually) that it was his parents or someone else putting the present in front of the tree. But when it comes to the science of origins, there is no feasible ""natural"" explanation that accounts for our ""biological presents"". In the Christmas example, that would be somewhat analogous to proving to the child that he is alone, his parents are not with him, and could not have made the trip to where he is, that no one else could have either, and yet, regardless, presents still appeared below the tree. The kid wouldn't be able to prove Father Christmas placed those gifts, but he'd know no human did either. So, knowing the Christmas story already, he'd think that maybe the story of Father Christmas was true after all. See, he can't prove Father Christmas put them there, but he can prove no one else did. That's the situation we have in biology. It's not religious tradition that proves God made life, it's science that proves nature is incapable of having done so. It's not mental illness to believe in god under such circumstances. But why were some church leaders so nasty in the past? And in the present. And not just church people, but people from all walks of life? For all the usual reasons. Back in those days the church was a chief route to political power, so many more were in the church in leadership roles then for the sake of power, than they are today. Now the equivalent is congress, business, the military, etc. The same holds true today where up to this point, in large institutional churches (and in many other large organizations) being in a leadership position gives one access to institutionalized children, and the power over them to do what one wants to do with them. It's not so much a case of mental illness as a case of the pursuit of power for evil motives. Christianity outlaws the abuse of children, but many church leaders do and did that anyway, because they believed they could get away with it, and were never all that interested in being obedient to the Christian ideology, which outlaws such behavior and threatens the worst consequences for doing that. As Jesus said, it would be better for people who abuse children to have a millstone put around their neck and to be cast into the deep ocean, than that they should interfere with the little ones.

Of course it doesn't work, but that's me. You'd need to really want to discover the limits of what evolution can do (and what it can't), but that's up to your curiosity if you want to find out. I'm incapable of arousing that interest, but again, evolution lacks the resources of time populations and mutation rates to really create anything new, because billions of years are too short by factors of hundreds of zeroes. Evolution sirts the vast amount of pre-existing variety but it's not much of a creative force. It selects from minor variations of what is already there. Evolution truly is SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST (mostly though not always because natural selection isn't all that efficient). The big question is, where does all that FITNESS come from? THAT is what abiogenesis and evolution were supposed to explain but they can't. All the examples you provided have to do with taking advantage of minor variations of what already exists. That's what evolution is. Where all that functional information came from in the first place? That's what evolution cannot explain. The best explanation is intelligent design. Only engineering (intelligent design) explains the origin of functionally complex systems.",UCL48KQs7LWlEOSWKA2q8h4w,1,UgxWHNyWVuvxyBiovSN4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

How? Maybe with reference to evolution? Darwinian evolution? I discussed the drawbacks of natural selection, which is the chief explanation for how evolution can replace design. Yes, I know how the theory goes. Here it is in brief: We have an initial functional biological system (we won't discuss how that arose just now, as it evolution we're talking about which requires life to already be in existence. That system then experiences a mutation. In it's DNA if it's a one celled organism, or otherwise a mutation in it's reproductive cells. Sometimes that mutation will change the DNA coding. Rarely it will cause a fatal effect, killing the reproduced creature quickly or slowly. Mostly it will have a nearly neutral effect. Less often it will have a clearly deleterious effect, making the organism less fit. Much less often it will have some kind of a beneficial effect on survival fitness. All this has been studied at length. We now know that in almost all known cases of beneficial mutations, the fitness benefit (which is a benefit that increases the representation of that mutated organism in the population) is due NOT because the mutation somehow helped to build a new functional system, but instead, the fitness benefit came about because the mutation damaged the organim in a ""beneficial"" way. Huh? Yes, that can happen. For example if a fish lives in a dark cave with no light at all, and can never swim to an area with light, then the eyes of that fish are subject to damage, such as infection of injury. but if a mutation takes place which damages the ability of that fish to form eyes normally, then even though the fish is now blinded by that mutation, in the environment (niche) of the dark cave, it was already blind anyway (no light) so the mutation actually gives that blind fish a survival benefit compared to other fish with eyes, because the blind fish isn't going to get an eye injury from bumping into something. Over time these fish may increase their representation n the population and may even take over the population altogether! But if the cave ever experiences a cave in, now exposing it to light from the outside, all these blind fish are now at a great disadvantage compared to any remaining fish that can still see. The point is, this is how evolution works just about all of the time. And as you'd be able to figure out, this kind of evolution doesn't build new functional systems, it only makes the best of a bad situation. To build new functional systems is not easy for mutations to achieve because functional systems are very complex and finely tuned. One might imagine that new systems are slight modifications of existing systems, but that is only true to the extent that we have slightly different variations to the same molecular machines. When it comes to building new machines, there are no easy evolutionarily traversible pathways of functional interconnectedness. Instead the various different functional machinery we see in life are isolated from each other by great gulfs of DNA configuration space. For example, if all the different molecular machines were evolutionariy related, we should observe that the DNA codings all fit onto a branching tree showing how the coding of the oldest original molecular machines changed bit by bit into other machines etc etc and you'd be able to place it onto a tree. The tree of life. Guess what, that assumed tree doesn't exist in reality. Of course, evolutionists have built many trees that attempt to link organisms and machinery, but these all conflict and do not resolve. Any such data can be fitted into non resolving trees of course, but that doesn't demonstrate evolution. To do that you'd need trees that resolve, but that isn't observed. See: https://www.sott.net/article/173647-Why-Darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life These people still believe in evolution, but they have had to admit (since 2009) that the data doesn't fit what the theory predicted. There are even what are known as orphan genes, which are proteins (molecular machines) that do not fit onto any known trees. They are isolated and yet form a quite large percentage (10% to 30% or more) of proteins! They actually look like they were specifically created to do what they do, with no hints of evolution (although you would find very slight variations within each orphan gene family as they have mutated a little over time). In any case, building new functional machinery (including orphan genes) means you need to make many many mutations. That is easy to do, but the problem is, there are so many more mutations that do not end up doing anything useful, compared to the small number which would. And natural selection cannot aid in that process. If you need to form the DNA sequence tcgcatagcttgctacgaatcgcattcacggatataggaaccgggtggccagctcaaagc acttcggagtcttacaagtcactcagcaacctcaggcagt to get something functional that will be beneficial then until you actually have a series of mutations which can build that sequence over a long period by altering an existing sequence. That can be done, but imagine how many other sequences exist which could be built, that won't do anything useful? Of curse, some sequences will cause death, and natural selection can easily weed those out, but most sequences are neutral. These mutations are thought to take place in unused gene copies, so the mutations accumulating don't interfere with the actual gene being used (or happen in so called junk DNA). But the problem is, the ratio of functional to nonfunctional sequences is astronomically small. This is known from experiments on proteins, see Doug Axe's work: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15321723 So in reality it really is rather like the lottery analogy. When nature is mutating a gene sequence, it does so randomly. How can natural selection guide the process? Since many mutations need to accumulate to build a new functional gene, protein, protein machines (which need mutations to link together the various protein parts that make up these machines, sometimes dozens or hundred of them) then how can we guide the process by natural selection? Natural selection acting on mutation IS Darwinian evolution (the new synthesis - that is) so how can natural selection pick and choose which mutations are going to work in the sequence ahead of time? But natural selection works by comparing different functional systems effects on reproductive fitness. How can it choose the mutational pathway to a new functional protein etc? Answer: IT CAN'T! We really are in a random lottery like situation. For ALL of evolution that is interesting, because evolution doesn't just explain slight variations, it needs to explain the origin of new function. But it cannot! There are too few mutations available, too little time to have them take place in, and too many nonfunctional DNA configurations versus functional ones, for evolution to ever be able to find them. Well, once every now and then evolution may ""find"" a simple protein sequence that has some effect on something else, but that is not what we're talking about. How are new protein machines that perfom complex biological functions evolved? No one knows! And don't forget, all these arguments presuppose the existence of amazingly complicated protein machines that make reporduction and life maintenance functions possible. The simplest possible life form takes about 400 enzymes and machines in order to be biologically viable. Any fewer and that life is short lived as it cannot function adequately enough to survive. But how did all of that appear? Abiogenesis has no explanations. All this needs design. See ICONS OF EVOLUTION https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZh-VJ20uC8 As to why God allowed destruction and evil? Who knows, but I'm guessing that at some point God's creatures (theoretically speaking, in an imagined perfect universe run by God) are going to ask the question, what if we go against God's will? What happens then? Might things be better than they are now? Is God holding us back? Our current world may well be an ongoing experiment allowed by God, to answer what happens when God doesn't control what takes place. God doesn't compel behaviour but allows free will. It appears this may in fact be the case, that God allowed things to run out of his control in order to teach us a lesson we can never forget, while at the same times providing a means of salvation. You already know you don't like the results of this experiment. neither does God! But he isn't going to stop the lesson until it's complete either. There will be no ""yeah but what if we had tried ..."" excuses. It will all have been tried. Some want to try to re-establish order via novel utopian central control schemes, to make things work properly and relieve suffering, but they don't work either, usually many many die as a result of misguided attempts to do good that nonetheless ignore what God has to say on the subject. Choices we make are not unlike biology or any other system containing functionality. There are many many more ways to foul up our existence than there are ways to improve existence. Best to stick with the original. AND - don't get sidetracked by prior church systems that weren't about God, but about people seeking political power. Not many people in politics can avoid corruption, including church leaders. If such leaders choose to pursue power and wealth by ignoring what God says on the topic, they will be doomed to fail eventually.",UCL48KQs7LWlEOSWKA2q8h4w,1,UgxWHNyWVuvxyBiovSN4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

We then should arrange our lives around what God wants. The argument for why there is a God that created the universe, and not just the universe itself I'll go into shortly (I already have before, but I'll recap it). But who created God? The question is really this: If the universe is all there is (no God) then what created the universe? If God exists and created the universe, then what created God? Do you believe in the eternal existence of the universe in some form? For example, for the big bang to take place, some kind of quantum system enabled that to happen. Perhaps you believe it has happened many times. Some believe it's happening all the time. Whatever you choose to believe along those lines, what created the ""system"" that can originate universes? I take it you don't disbelieve in an eternally existing system that can originate universes (or sets of them). Right? It's logical to believe in a first (itself uncaused) cause which was not itself created, which can then gives rise to effects that are in turn causes for other effects. Logically, the only entities that require creation are entities which had a cause. It is illogical to believe in an entity creating itself. Logic demands either an uncreated God (which is an intelligent and personal entity) as a first cause, or else an impersonal non-intelligent system, capable of originating universes as the uncreated cause. Take your pick. But I choose God, because as argued previously, the nature of biology (and perhaps the structure of physics as well, but for now most obviously in biology) requires the phenomena of intelligent design (the conscious and knowledgeable manipulation of reality) to explain the origin of life, rather than evolution / abiogenesis, because such ideas relying on chance arrangements (with some natural selection effects thrown in) fall far short of adequately explaining the origin and development of the functional chemistry of life. Academia as a whole nowadays says evolution and abiogenesis are adequate to explain life, but they're not. When pressed in detail, you'll see it's a conclusion based on lots of faith with little hard evidence. There are too many nonfunctional configurations of chemicals to choose from, compared to the number of functional configurations for processes such as abiogenesis and evolution to have ever found enough of the functional ones. Natural selection can't explain this since natural selection cannot even begin to work until functional chemical arrangements have already been found (via chance mutations). See? Now we have a big problem. We first need mutation to ""find"" our functional arrangements first, by random chance, before natural selection can appear to try and preserve such new functional systems, and there's the additional problem that a new functional system isn't likely to be functional until there are multiple components of the new system that can all work together. Also we now know there are no natural tendencies for chemistry to pre-select functional arrangements to help non living chemicals get to be living chemicals, other than the machinery of life itself. Outside of the functional chemistry of life, nothing drives chemistry towards functionality, but there are many many tendencies that drive living functional chemistry towards non living chemicals! Meaning that only life is observed to give rise to life. And once life exists, it has a tendency towards ageing and death and breakdown, rather than a tendency towards greater functionaility! SOMETHING such as BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING (a form of intelligent design) must have taken place to get life going in the past, because there is no known natural tendencies that drive chemistry from non life towards life. Hence an inference to God. We never see life appearing from non living chemistry for some fairly obvious chemical and physical reasons. It's logical to attribute that design to God. If we attribute it to aliens of some kind, we have to then go back to their creator(s). So we can skip that step. Here's an analogy of what I'm saying: We believe a certain person can win a lottery of the usual kind (a winner per hundred thousand lottery tickets) once, or maybe very rarely twice in a row (or twice or more) in their whole lives, but we do not believe a person can win 10000 lotteries of that kind one after the other with no break. if a certain person were to win 10000 lotteries on a row (or even 10 in a row) we would suspect some kind of cheating had been taking place. It's theoretically possible they could win any number of lotteries in a row, but in reality, that's not feasible, it is never going to happen because there are far too many ways to buy losing tickets in comparison to the small number of ways to buy all the correct winning tickets. So lets pretend we have a scenario where someone actually does win (if they could live long enough ;-) 10000 lotteries one after the other. Do we conclude they did so by luck? Or do we conclude there is some kind of cheating scheme or conspiracy to buy winning lottery tickets? I'll just say that the second operation wouldn't be called a ""conspiracy theory"" because there would be hard evidence to conclude there was actually an actual conspiracy. So here, an inference to a conspiracy to manipulate the continual purchase of winning lottery tickets equates to an inference to the intelligent design of chemical systems which operate biology. Concluding that winning 10000 lotteries in a row equates to pure luck, is like concluding abiogenesis and evolution are responsible for the origin of life.

A brisk breeze would sort this out. Oh and each human exhales 2.3 tons of CO2 each year. We have 23mill cattle in the UK and 67 mill people, guess who is doing the polluting, if CO2 is a pollutant, which it isn&#39;t. I developed a bio-system to reduce CO2 on an industrial scale 14 years ago. No one was interested. Why ? Because far too many are being paid to campaign against CO2 emissions. The last thing they need is a smart arse coming along with a solution. I have newspaper cutting from 2005, saying we face a global catastrophe in the next 10 years, and another, antarctic sea ice melting would raise sea levels around the globe ( yes its a globe and not flat ) by 16 feet. I was at the seaside yesterday and levels were at and around the same levels 40 years ago ( I know the east side of the UK is sinking from the last ice age melting ). So where is this 16 feet of sea level rise. Have you got it in your pocket. Arctic ice melting was going to kill polar bears. It didn&#39;t, indeed polar bear populations grew from 16000 to approx 39000. So scientists ask why the lies to our children ????

CO2 concentration is largely due to combustion processes in industry and automobiles combined with massive deforestation over the past few centuries. Most all plant life, both terrestrial and aquatic, convert CO2 into O2, among other compounds to provide themselves with energy throughout the photosynthesis process. It&#39;s not about too much of certain elements in the atmosphere as much as the global increase of heat and pressure through the enormously massive amounts of combustion from industry/big tech dumping millions of trillions of PPM of (insert compound here) on top of the simple fact that almost all forms of combustion result in an increase of heat and pressure as the energy from the combustible materials is released. Besides, anyone who has learned anything about the Earth knows that it has gone through several climate cycles so climate change in itself should be expected. Anyone with a thought-capable brain should be able to see that humanity itself has been exponentially accelerating climate change over the past century or more. And people act surprised or freak out that we are seeing climate change... Too busy focused on themselves to realize that the climate we have now is vastly different from what it was even hundreds of years ago. Biospheres have changed, plant life and animals have gone extinct due to either natural or man made changes in environment, this all has an effect on climate. And I didn&#39;t even get into how all the nuclear bomb testing in the 60s affects the ozone, and ultimately, the climate. The USA alone spent billions of dollars punching holes in the atmosphere.

At the same time global warming is the solution for the very same problem. Global warming WILL be fixed- just not in the way you would like for it to be fixed. Before the industrial revolution people died by natural causes keeping the population down to a reasonable level. However humans, just like bacteria, will gobble up any possible resource until it is finally extinguished.Finally, just like bacteria, when those resources are used up, human population will naturally decline to a sustainable level again. History will remember our generation as the &quot;population blip&quot; of the 21st century. It will likely never be repeated for 100s of years. We are simple following a natural course of population evolution. We may be able to conceive of alternative courses, but history has proven that this will not actually happen.

Global warming is not the issue, the earth has been slowly warming since the last ice age and will continue to do so until it starts cooling for the next ice age. The question is the effect of CO2 released into the atmosphere by human activities. This effect is essentially trivial. This point cannot be argued with someone who does not understand the scientific method and is governed by his feelings. Open your mind and listen to the real scientists and you will learn. FYI, computer models are NOT science! They are a technological &quot;crystal ball&quot; that is just about as accurate. I think it was the great sage Yogi Berra who said, &quot;Making predictions is difficult, especially in regards to the future.&quot; Though we have all met people who have an uncanny ability to predict the past, unfortunately, the current models are unable to even predict the past behavior of the earth&#39;s climate. <br /> <br />Politicians are throwing money that they do not have at a problem that does not exist in order to finance solutions that make no difference. <br />Michael Hart <br /> <br /> <br />We were warned in 1961 about government funded &quot;Science&quot;! <br />President Eisenhower warned of a &quot;Technological Elite&quot; in his farewell address to the nation.

A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government. <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />The prospect of domination of the nation&#39;s scholars by Federal employment, project allocation, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded. <br /> <br />Yet in holding scientific discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.[1]?",UCb7uHuFEMj1XsIVkFriqsXA,0,UgzWz7e5lj4WtNV0z5l4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The primary cause is lack of access to affordable clean energy. Without energy, you can't grow food effectively, you can't cultivate or irrigate and you are at the mercy of the climate, which may not always cooperate. Several billion people have no electricity. Many of them cook food over wood or biomass fires which are responsible for respiratory diseases which are the leading cause of death in developing nations. All of these things are real and happening now, and we can fix them by allowing them access to affordable clean energy (that would be oil and gas). Fortunately, CO2 has helped quite a bit by significantly""greening"" the earth and making crops more drought resistant. This (along with modern agriculture technology) has helped increase crop yields by over 25% in the last 30 years. Unfortunately, developing nations without access to affordable energy have not enjoyed these increased crop yields as much. If your motivation is rooted in altruism, and keeping people from starving to death, you will pray our climate remains warm and rich with CO2.

What this means is that as we raise people out of poverty around the world the population will start to level out meaning it isn't really a problem.

I whole heatedly encourage you to look up the latest research on solar forcing, along with the latest research showing the overestimation of heating effects of carbon by 50% and the underestimation of cloud cooling by an equally astoundingly 50% . This means that a good portion of the warming that has been attributed to carbon had to have come from the increased solar activity, which by the way around the year 2000 was the highest it had been in around 9000 years. People like to say the suns total solar irradiance only changes like .01 percent. Tell me, If I offered you .01% of a billion dollars, are you really going to turn down $10,000,000? The point is scale matters.

CO2 is not causing the atmosphere to heat.<br /><br /><br />Earth radiates at peak wavelength of 10 microns which corresponds to 59 degrees F, which is the average temperature of our planet. Most of this radiated energy( about 63 % of the total) is centered about 10 microns and within a couple of microns above and below 10 microns. That means whatever is absorbing the majority of the infrared radiated by Earth should have an peak absorption in the 8- 12 micron bandwidth. CO2 absorbs strongly at 2.7, 4.3, and 15 microns. Most gases including CO2 all absorb in very narrow bands around their peaks, no more than 2 microns on either side of the peak.<br /><br /><br /> This means that CO2 is absorbing only very negligible amounts of energy from the Earth. Coupled with that and the fact that Earth is not even close to being a perfect blackbody radiator(a perfect blackbody radiator does not exist in nature). The Earth is at best radiating with an emissivity of ..8 to .9. This means that the radiated energy of the Earth&#39;s surface is only a small percentage of the total infrared held by the surface of the Earth.<br /><br /><br />Furthermore, when CO2 absorbs a photon it vibrates over a period of time in the microsecond time range and then emits a different wavelength that is not in the CO2 absorption band. That photon has less than a 50% chance of being reabsorbed by the Earth since CO2 emits in a solid angle in all directions which includes back into space. What all this boils down to is that 1 molecule of CO2 is absorbing such extremely small amounts infrared that it&#39;s vibrations would be completely incapable of heating even a few molecules( say 4-5 molecules) of N2 and O2 around it to a temperature of even a fraction of a degree, let alone the 2500 molecules that surround it.",UCUSq-TyoXHgOAt7swGYSPyw,0,UgxvMkFgDhgr8Xvvm4J4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

This means that most of the heat producing radiation escapes it. About 8% of the available black body radiation is picked up by these ""fingerprint"" frequencies of CO2."" source: https://nov79.com/gbwm/ntyg.html , lol I suggest you try the second one on google, or better try a report from the IPCC, it has a bit more science in it :). Also, don't believe a backyard website made by a guy who also claims the earth is flat... Or better, do it at home, it's a very simple experiment to do. all you need is a light source, a bottle of CO2 a somewhat close chamber and a small detector to measure the intensity per wavelength that pass through. Fun fact you can do that with any gaz, try water vapor for example, you will find quickly that given a sufficient density practically nothing passes through. (Try driving in a dense fog in the morning if you are not convinced), I will do you a favor and copy here the second link that you find on google when you type CO2 absorption, http://jvarekamp.web.wesleyan.edu/CO2/FP-1.pdf since apparently your extensive bibliography research did not go that far. Enjoy. (No need to thank me) Oh and also,2.7, 4.3 and 15 micrometers is in the middle of the infrared bandwidth.

They were also grazers and produced methane as a result of this. No they did not deforest the plains but they did stop the plains from being forested. This is also true for parts of Africa where the populations of Zebra, Gazelles etc have been drastically reduced by humans to make way for agriculture. Yes cattle produce methane and graze, but are they present in numbers which match their predecessors? I think not. As for a vegetarian diet being healthier, that is very debatable. Those that have studied human anatomy know that our dentition and gastrointestinal systems are more adapted to meat eating than plant eating. We naturally digest meat while we depend upon bacteria to digest plant material. That is why cow farts have so much methane in them. This is also true for vegetarians if you are honest with yourself. That is because all of the energy contained within plants is not digested and released as methane.<br /> As for runaway greenhouse gasses, take a close look at Venus. I believe it&#39;s surface temperature is about 700 degrees C. This is mainly caused by its thick cloud cover which acts like a blanket holding in the heat. Yes the earth will still be here regardless of what we do, but I kinda like the idea that at present earth has a huge amount of life on it. We are the only planet in our solar system which has life. That suggests that it is relatively rare in our Universe.

In fact evaporation/condensation is the principle way in which the atmosphere gets heated. True enough CO2 does absorb some heat directly from sunlight (very little) and rather more from infrared radiationfrom the Sun but because there is so little CO2 the effect is truly miniscule. <br />Not only does water vapour absorb much more heat radiation than CO2 but (liquid) water circulates directly from the tropics to the poles, taking tropical heat with it.<br />At the South Pole this has little effect because South Polar ice doesn&#39;t get heated by circulating water because it sits on solid rock like the ice cap on Greenland, both caps are kilometers thick.<br />By contrast, the North Pole has 4000 meters of (liquid )water underneath it and, at most, 10 meters of ice, floating on top of water circulating from the tropics.<br />Now this 10 meters of ice is rather fragile, quite different from the kilometers at the South Pole and on Greenland. <br />As long as the North Polar ice is not broken the temperature gets very low (-70C?)<br />But if the ice North Polar ice is broken by wind or Russian ice breakers, water at about +4deg. C comes through the cracks and, wonder of wonders, the local temperature rises to +4deg. C!<br />This has an enormous effect on the surface temperature and completely changes the local climate, or even the North Polar climate if the break up is big enough i.e. if the wind is strong enough.<br />You may well agree that CO2 is not &#39;a climate change&#39; villain!",UCOYcxctZ8VkgFb1P7nufymA,0,UgyRQjCINyNgAWfb3Ap4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

I'm not even trying to argue that there is a DIRECT correlation to plant growth and atmospheric C02, but there is clearly a correlation that has yet to be calculated.

But put simply, think about the basic processes involved. What are fossil fuels? How do plants sequester carbon? When a tree or animal dies, their body decomposes. It's food for microbes that undergo respiration, releasing CO2. Thus, when plants take up CO2, they more often than not release it after they die. Fossil fuels are created over *millions* of years. They're created on geologic time scales. They require biomass to be trapped by geologic structures, and undergo incredible pressure to turn into a 'fuel'. That's not a very fast process to sequester anything. Limestone formations sequester carbon faster than that.

This is a lie. Fed to you by conservative press, arguing on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. Truth of the matter is very few scientists ever spoke about an ""ice age"", although there were some National Geographic and Newsweek articles citing a minority of scientists because ""scientists claim the earth will have a new ice age"" sells. The actual scientific community at the time was not arguing or warning about an ice age. Global warming, on the other hand, you're right, the science goes back OVER 100 years. CO2's greenhouse effect has been known for a while, so yeah, even in 1896 we had scientists talking about this. Which brings me to the next point. ""Why are the predictions and the models so consistently incorrect?"" Astoundingly, they aren't. In 1896 Svante Arrhenius predicted that doubling CO2 concentrations would produce warming of 5-6 C. In 1896. Well in 1896 CO2 concentrations were roughly 250ppm, we're at 410 today. If we take A1B, emissions will peak in 2050, putting us on track for about 500ppm by then, and ~700 by the end of the century. I'm trying to think positive but whatever. Following A1B, we're on track for 3 degrees C above 2000s levels by 2100. Which is, roughly, 1-1.5 degrees C above the temperature in 1900. Thankfully, because this model has peak emissions in 2050, by 2300 the model doesn't see warming higher than 4 degrees above 2000s levels. Was his prediction, made in 1896, perfect? No. But given it was 1896, well before the advent of computers, I think we can cut the guy some slack. If, however, you went with models from roughly the 1990s or later, like the original IPCC report... you'll find their predictions are pretty damn accurate indeed. We've gotten better in the past 100 years. ""Isn't the point of performing scientific analysis to predict outcomes?"" I mean, yes, but that doesn't mean every problem is easy. We still have a hard time predicting the outcome of fluid dynamics. But it'd be a mistake to say we know less about fluids today than we did over a hundred years ago when the Navier Stokes Equations were created. ""Why are you so sure of yourself, and why does everyone think tax on an essential will deliver us from climate change and actual pollution?"" I was unaware that fossil fuels are necessarily 'essential'. No one thinks that a carbon tax will solve climate change. This video explicitly is about how climate change is irreversible. How these effects are going to last in our environment for a long time. But you know what a carbon tax might do? Help us get to peak carbon by 2050 and let me keep using the predictions of A1B, because it's the most likely outcome given humanity's tendencies. You know what I want to avoid? A1FI. Because there the predictions start looking a whole lot more ""oh. Look. We're in danger of causing a Permian-extinction like event"". A1FI is scary. Very scary. Incredibly scary. That's where these 'doomsday' predictions all come from. It's from models where we say ""what happens if we don't get our act together at any point in time"". And they're terrifying. Most predictions aren't A1FI. Most predictions think ""we're not that stupid"".

PLANT MORE TREES!! and stop over developing. Let&#39;s just stop building stuff, it&#39;s that simple. Trees are the lungs of earth. We would have a very, toxic atmosphere if we didn&#39;t have trees. If human development (i.e. concrete, steel buildings, etc.) keep getting erected, guess what? The trees suffer = more carbon in the air, soil erosion, flooding, mud slides, loss of habitat for wildlife, food source, renewable resource, etc. etc. etc.<br />And I&#39;m talking about ALL trees, but especially the rainforests.  <br /><br />These two factors alone work hand in hand.

There is quite literally nothing that will prevent the coming future. No global drastic action will be taken to prevent that. Even &quot;lessening&quot; the &quot;future pollution&quot; is irrelevant as we cannot stop runaway impacts. The time to act as a planet was 40+ years ago. Not only did that not happen but each passing year became worse and worse.<br /><br /><br />Let me put this into words that make more sense. Did humans cause global warming? That is not relevant. We are in a burning house and people are arguing about who started the fire. Bill over there has already burned to death and John is on fire. The house is burning to the ground and we cannot stop it. See the problem? There is no solution. The solution WAS to not let the house catch on fire in the first place. WHY the house is burning is not a relevant question. WHO started the fire is not a relevant question. The plan should be how to get out of the fucking house, which is why NASA and private corporations are working on Mars, Europa, and Titan missions for relocating the human species. They seem to know something that you do not. That we need to get off of the planet before the entire species is wiped out. Tick tock.<br /><br /><br />People are optimistic and pretend we are a species will live on forever. You are very, very mistaken. The earth does not care about your existence. In fact it does not like you or your presence and wants you to leave. Even 10,000 years from now the earth itself will get along just fine. The earth is not dying, the earth is doing just fine. The inhabitants of said planet on the other hand.. are not doing so well and have arrogantly set their own extinction into play. Congrats.<br /><br /><br />Any person on earth that believes that &quot;global warming&quot; can be stopped is not educated on the sciences and has not done the research.<br />Any person believing that present day changes can help &quot;curb&quot; this &quot;global warming&quot; does not comprehend the scale of the issue at hand.<br /><br />Any person that does not believe in climate change, regardless of how it is formed, is uneducated and deserves to die.<br /><br /><br /><br />Listen to the ignored warnings from 1981 - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puCng0p6N_s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puCng0p6N_s</a>",UC1e--vKktMo2O2QA6duBjag,0,UgzcnbrOhjSH5BRGLkh4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

I am always astounded that every weather report today is predicted by climate change and the hysteria associated with this social media nonsense. A frenzy that is making Politicians form knee jerk reactions for political popularity built through stupidity. A climate industry leaching off the public purse. The average life span of humans is some 76 yrs, and few will make 90 or 100. The youth of today are less intelligent than those of my day and will rally to any populous fad or fake news or over emotional garbage. They need to understand that the world regardless of their vitriol will end! Climate has nothing to do with it. The reason, the sun will die — life on earth whether tomorrow or 1000 years or 100000 years or 5 billion years will end. Therefore a human travelling through this time is inconsequential to the outcome. Imagine the Neurosis of today&#39;s society at the beginning of the previous Ice Ages. However, the current scientific thought is that the Earth has some 5 billion years left. People need to understand that the lifespan and exsistance of life on the earth are wholly dependent upon the ageing of the sun. Scientifically in about 5 billion years from now, the sun is going to reach a point where its core can no longer sustain the nuclear fusion as it has been and it will evolve into a red giant. A red giant star is a dying star in the last stages of stellar evolution. Therefore, that means the sun could grow large enough to engulf the earth as well as our nearby planets, but even if it doesn&#39;t, life will still cease to exist on earth at some point during the sun&#39;s transformation into a red giant.

Its called a feed back loop, and they understand it well. Several times in the historic record, temperature changes starting rising before the CO2. (Not every time.) The CO2 increase then caused more heat to be trapped, increasing the temperature. For example, rising temperatures enable permafrost to thaw out. We see this happening right now. Thawing permafrost allows all of that dead vegetation to decompose to methane and CO2. That doesn't change what the CO2 does. It helps retain heat. There have been several instances of CO2 increases driving the heat increase. But nothing like today. There has never been a time when the atmosphere's composition has changed as rapidly as it is right now. In the past, life has had time to adjust to the change - many things still went extinct, but species and populations did get a chance to evolve. This current change is hundreds of times or thousands of times faster than any recorded change - even the dinosaur killing meteor had a slower overall effect on the atmosphere's composition. It is very easy to understand why - we are taking carbon that has been sequestered under the earth for millions of years and converting it to CO2 in our atmosphere. We know how much - the world's use of fossil fuels is well documented and accounted for. You don't need to imagine any other source - this accounts for the increases in temperature that have been measured in many different ways by many different independent people. Your first argument is just stupid - CO2 absorbs more infrared light, whether in a bottle or an entire atmosphere, like Venus. Venus is ridiculously hot because it's atmosphere is mostly CO2.

The melting ice acts as a buffer keeping temperatures relatively stable. However, this is a limited time offer! The big question is what happens once all that ice has disappeared? There will be nothing to keep temperatures from rising exponentially. By the 22nd century all intelligent life will have to find ways to build cities underground or underwater. Elon Musk&#39;s new boring machine has already begun this process,<br />A viable strategy for offsetting atmospheric CO2 levels has been known for several decades but the Lizards won&#39;t allow it to be deployed. The addition of large quantities of low cost minerals, especially iron, to the worlds oceans would promote plankton growth on a massive scale. The plankton are either eaten by fish or fall to the ocean floor when they die. Either way, carbon is removed from the ocean which then allows the oceans to take the CO2 out of the atmosphere. This also has the potential to massively increase the worlds food supply with an unimaginable abundance of fish.<br />Whats not to love? Explain why this is not already being implemented.

Especially when high sequestration drives the net emissions highly negative. Apparently, you missed the class on carbon sequestration in places like the American prairie. b) Each inch of soil can hold between 4 and 8 tons of carbon per acre. There are about 10 billion acres of grassland, savana, and steppe in the world. Half of that would be 5 billion acres @ 4 tons of carbon @ a minimum of 1 inch of soil per year, which gives a minimum estimate of 20 Gt/yr. At the high end, you get 120 Gt/yr at a 3 inch gain in soil. Of course, this doesn't include forest sequestration, and phytoplankton would probably dwarf both.

There is a video of an Australian rancher whose station is surrounded by gas wells and he shows the gas emissions. If there are sufficient hydroxyl radicals or methophagic bacteria in the ground, much of the methane breaks down, is oxidized, and then you get CO2 bubbles. Better, but not good. <br />The &quot;natural&quot; heating events of the last 800,000 years occurred when the sea began to emit CO2 after a period of neutral uptake. Uptake slows as the average heat of the ocean increases. Then it stops for a while, neither absorbing or releasing CO2. Then the kill shot begins, the rate of CO2 emissions will be amplified by the rapidly increasing heat, with the atmosphere receiving not only the &quot;natural&quot; CO2, but the continued assault by carbon fuel emissions. And methane decomposition. And weathering of rock by acidic rain. The dead zones forming NOW in the seas such as the Caribbean Sea will emit H2S which is toxic. You will feel ill if you breathe air with 40 ppm hydrogen sulfide. Incapacitated at around 150 ppm and dead at 200 ppm. H2S is thought to have played a role as the coup de grace of the end Permian Mass Extinction event. Perhaps others of the 5 Mass Extinctions we know about. This is going to be the sixth, and I don&#39;t see any way to even do minimal effective mitigation. Keep looking. And DO something. It may be that the ONLY job anyone will have in a few years is in mitigation or repair of the planet. Nothing that is incompatible with survival would be allowed, and everything that enhances survival will be mandatory. The old Soviet model... &quot;Anything not forbidden is mandatory&quot;.

To be honest, the main argument against pumping CO2 into atmosphere is &quot;we cannot forsee how will the ecosystems change, so better stop doing that to avoid something potentially catastrophic&quot; rather than &quot;we know for sure, that this, that and that will happen if we raise temperatures by X&quot;.<br /><br />Still, reducing emissions is a reasonable thing to do, but I kinda hate when people say &quot;scientists predict&quot;, when the overall system is so complex, that in long time period almost anything can happen, if you tweak the parameters just slightly, and even a small error might compound into huge difference.

Co2 is what plants and trees breath. Or luou Chen on the ree greening project. The problem is mostly to do with deforestation and man's missus of land than anything to do with co2. I have given you examples of this is trying to explain that in the forests of the planet the trees that haven't been chopped down have started to grow faster with much larger growth rings . 1 because they have more co2. For photocnthasis thus converting co2 to oxygen. The solution isent cutting our noses to spite our faces. And costing trillions to some how do less effectively what nature can do for free. Co2 isent the enamy deforestation is. Natural simple solution that mother nature can provide. Not loads of so called experts lining their pockets with government grants twisting the truth about this whole thing. Simple solutions are normally the ones that work best .not some over exaggerated and expensive plan to cut something that is the basis of all life on the planet. Carbon. After all, all those fossil fuels came from. ...... layed down in the most prolific pereod in earth's history . When it was warmer and their was more co2 in the atmosphere. It dosent have to be complicated . The earth's climate has changed since this little orb's appearance in the cosmos. So why all the fuss. Blaming everything on burning fossil fuels is crazy.

Their graph of sea ice extent as measured every September shows a small shift early in the 20th century, followed by a long, flat plateau and then a sharp drop in the last 30 years. From the study, which was compiled last year, I quote: ""There is no point in the past 150 years where sea ice extent is as small as it has been in recent years. Second, the rate of sea ice retreat in recent years is unprecedented in the historical record."" If you wish to argue with all of the world's snow and ice data centers, feel free.

Watch NASA TIME LAPSE VIDEO OF ARCTIC ICE to see the oldest, thickest ice vanish before your eyes. Ice extent returns every winter, sometimes in large swaths, sometimes in smaller ones. That ice will be forming for decades to come and is not an accurate measure of warming.

Harold Wanless, a geologist at the University of Miami is quoted as saying that ""sinking is a non-issue on the greater portion of Miami Beach."" Sea level, he said, is the greater concern. He added that subsidence is temporary and stops after a few decades, and is going to be overwhelmed by sea level rise. ""In Miami Beach, our city surveyor is out there every day, working in the city and he has not observed subsidence or any changes in elevation,"" says Elizabeth Wheaton, Director of Environment And Sustainability. She says that surveyors are using fixed control points to ensure they're getting an accurate read on rising seas. ""There's so much misinformation about what's happening,"" she says.

Alarmist do when they ignore the subsidence. For instance, the mayor of Miami denied that subsidence was part of the problem even though the governments satellites show that over half of the loss of altitude of the city was due to subsidence. When you remove the subsidence, the sea level rise was no different in the last 2 decades as the first 2 decades of the 20th century. Louisiana is almost completely due to subsidence, which is why theirs is so much worse. No one says that there isn't any sea level rise. But when you take out what has been only happening in the last half century due to subsidence, there is no change from a century ago. No, the gage is showing a much greater than the 2 mm that has happened over the last 5 years according to the satellites. BUT the most telling is that when it something like the temperature from satellites, they will talk loud and frequently about how much the data is being affected by the loss in altitude of the satellites, but when its the sea level change their satellites are totally stable. Its interesting that it could be that the only change is from the satellites losing altitude. Those satellite photos take the time from the coldest part of the 60 year cycle (1970's) as the baseline.

Centuries ago, they did not have electron microscopes or even basic microscopes. They did not have thermometers, or even instruments of anything we would describe as such. They were not even called scientist, since that term had not been invented yet. What they had was brains, eyes, tongues ears and noses. They also had the sense of touch. They began to record things, and categories their findings, the correlated them. People saw them as experts. So they began to discuss with each other what they found, and they sent messages back and forth. Eventually magazines were created and the began to tell people about their discoveries. In the beginning most people did not know anything about it, because most people could not read or write, but they did not matter. They had important job that did not require reading. They kept people alive. As time went on, people thought up ways to fake science, and in some cases, they got away with it for a long time. So these people came up with a set of things to prevent accidental or deliberate corruption of science (although it was not called that yet) In times these were updated again and again as more people thought of new ways to fake science. These things were eventually known as ""standard scientific procedures. Experts in the field still held sway though. If someone came along with a theory that was radical, they would do their best to destroy it. ONLY after they had tried for decades or even centuries were a lot of these accepted. Even the laws of science, as they were called, got questioned all the time and much learning came from exploiting this questioning. For the most part, laws are almost impossible to destroy, but it is possible to modify them if the knowledge comes along that improves the understanding of them. Then instruments were invented and our learning was improved. Many things that were believed before were questioned because of the new instruments. Some long held beliefs were destroyed completely, replaced by new knowledge, but that replacement did not happen quickly. Every thing had to be tested, questioned, tested again and question more. Over time, many theories were proven to be hoaxes. This happened because people stuck to using standard scientific procedures and those were constantly questioned and updated. All the while, experts were learning and teaching new people. And they were writing and letting others see their work. When someone can prove his knowledge to older experts, he becomes and expert. So every expert in any field we have today is expert that has been vetted by other experts and their data has been accepted and questioned and tested and proven. Then along comes so called climatologist. These people declare that their field is so new that they can only be vetted by each other. People publishing articles about glaciology said that because it was about climatology, they did not need to show it to glaciologist. An astrophysics climatologist could just as easily review it. That astrophysics climatologist proved he was an expert by publishing and article and instead of having it published in astrophysics peer review published it in a magazine that was wide spectrum science, and having it reviewed by a geologist climatologist. That climatologist proved he was an expert by having his work reviewed by a glaciologist climatologist. The same one above. Each one reviewed an area outside his expertise and didn't say a word about glaring holes because he wanted his own work approved. So no previously vetted expert ever vetted their articles and they were accepted. They were not reviewed by peers because as climatologist, they saw themselves as having no peers outside of climatology. That is why these people can not be published in science specific peer review journals, because the experts in those fields would tear them apart.

Cherry picking is saying that the artic lost 60% of the ice since the 1970's and blaming it on co2 increasing, totally ignoring the fact that the melt started AT LEAST by 1902. THAT is when we have the first survey of the artic ice. 90% of the ice that was present then has disappeared. The 40% of what is still left, is only 10% of what was there at the turn of the century. That's a quarter of the loss. Which means that more than half the ice disappeared BEFORE co2 was a problem. Do alarmist notice the fact that co2 did not cause half the loss? No, it would ruin their narrative. Here is another factor they ignore. 1900's was the bottom of a 60 year cycle, meaning it was the coldest the artic got. Then it warmed up. Then it cooled and the 1970's was the bottom of the next cycle. What we have not after it has recovered slightly, is what the surveys of the 1950's showed.

If you put a pan full of ice on a stove and turn the heat down from high to medium, will it stop melting? The only people that ever theorized that solar irradiance had ANYTHING to do with the climate was the alarmist. IF you had used earlier proxies you would see that solar irradiance was very high during the little ice age, when the temperature was low. Why? Because it was easy to disprove something that is unrelated is unrelated, thus you can by extension claim the sun is unrelated. That claim is still a lie The suns energy is more or less the same as it was in the bronze warming period, over a degree hotter than it is now. The earth's water is like a battery for heat. When it loses heat, water turns to ice, just as when a chemical battery loses its electrical charge the chemistry changes. When you charge a battery the chemistry changes back to what is active. When you add heat to the earth, the ice melts. After the mwp, there was a 500 year period where a lot of the energy from the sun was lost due to something reflecting the energy back. You can choose which of several theories you want, but it doesn't matter for the discussion of the past 1000 years temperature. Discussion of future temperatures would depend on what caused the lia. What is a fact is the glaciers expanded because of the lack of energy reaching the earth surface. After the lia ended (at least the end of the last phase), the earth's surface began to receive more energy again. This caused the glaciers to start melting and the energy that was being stored in the ice and the ocean (which had also lost some of its energy) increased. That increase in energy is read as in increase in global temperature.",UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g,1,Ugx2QFJEDcoRE-RiFfZ4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The earth like a heat version of the battery. It stores heat in water. When a battery charges goes down, the chemicals in the batter change. When the earth loses heat, the water freezes. When the battery is recharged, the chemical change again, to ones that can hold the charge. When the earth warms the ice melts. The sun is giving us more or less then same energy it has for the last 2000 years. About 1500 years ago, something happened that reflected the suns energy away from the earth surface. This meant that when the summer sun tried to melt the ice, there was not enough energy to do so, at least not as much as had laid down the previous winter. This meant the glaciers expanded. The suns energy was the same, it just could not reach the land. Then 350 years ago, the cause (choose which of several possibilities, but the evidence said it was there) of the reflection stopped and the earth received more energy. The ice no longer built up but instead the heat melted more ice than the winter snows could deposit. At the same time (little ice age), the ocean lost energy to space when water was vaporized and the energy radiated into space.

Fact: Heating any material stores energy in that material. Fact: The average temperature of a body includes every part of that body. Fact: The body called the earth includes the water and the glaciers. Moving one to the other causes the average temperature to increase. Conclusion: Melting tons of ice into water and raising it to increase in temperature 15°C average for the ocean, means average temperature of the earth goes up. I do not know the temperature of the ice, except it is 0°C or less. The earth is increasing in temperature about .009°C a year. IF the average increase of water is 18°, that means for every ton of ice that is melted and the water raised to the average temperature of the earth, the increase in temperature of 2000 tons of earth is accounted for. Alaska by itself loses 75 BILLION tons of water. that 7x10^10. Multiply that by 2x10^3 and Alaska accounts for 1.4x10^13 of the earths warming every year. Antarctica accounts for 3 times that much. Greenland almost 5. The arctic 10 x OR MORE. Add the rest of the glaciers and the permafrost and you have a large portion of the increase. Now add that the ocean, 70% of the surface of the earth has warmed 3° (nasa shows that has happen fairly recently) and there is no room for co2 to have cause much if any of the warming.",UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g,1,Ugx2QFJEDcoRE-RiFfZ4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Assuming you're a monotheist, probably belonging to one of the three major monotheistic religions, then your theology claims that this god is all knowing and all powerful - which necessarily means he created all the conditions in this Universe with a perfect foreknowledge of what would ensue (which includes the idea of free will) - that necessarily makes this same god ultimately responsible for EVERYTHING. 'No competent person that claims to worship the so called ""Invisible GOD"" would destroy the very ""visible nature"" on which he depends'. And yet this happens with believers and non-believers, so your point is what exactly? 'To quote that ""Invisible GOD"": ...and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. Revelation 11:18' Er..no, you are quoting from a book written by man which claims to be the word of a god - HUGE difference! *Lesson hopefully learned...* That wasn't any lesson *...maybe the people that claim there is no global destruction on their part may not really believe much in GOD* Again, repeating the same erroneous non-sequitur won't suddenly make your point valid. *After all, would GOD be happy about devout worshippers F@$#-ing up his creation????* Why would an all powerful and all knowing god require worship of any description?

It is far more efficient to source nutrition from plant based nutrition. Flesh and animal products are simply processed plants. The vast majority of the animals we kill for our food are HERBIVORES eating PLANTS as nutrition. Cut out the massively inefficient middle process. Destruction of habits for wildlife, pollution of our land, rivers, seas, oceans and air are caused not by car emissions mostly but animal agriculture. Climate change and abuse of the planet resources.<br /><br />In a nutshell...feeding humanity based on burgers, steaks cows milk eggs and other animal based food...means feeding animals huge amounts of crop foods mainly GMO crops that uses the land hugely more than if crops were grown for human food. Pollution of excretions in the ground, rivers, seas and air pollution cause environmental AND human health diseases due to the massive numbers and intensity involved to feed just 20 percent of the RICH developed populations and countries. There is no way at current consumption levels of animal based foods that a country can feed its own population. Poorer countries land is taken by big corporations to grow ANIMAL feed instead of food for people. The ratio is at least 15 to 1 land use for the same level of PROTEIN supply as a measure to compare the inefficiency and waste.<br /><br />It does not matter which measures are used...whether stating 20 or 51 percent depending on what is measured as the emissions that cause climate change...the MOST single human activity is ANIMAL AGRICULTURE followed by TRANSPORT...and since animal agriculture uses MASSES of TRANSPORT for the FOOD to feed the animals from abroad and the exports movements of animals...this is the main contributor. All the aerosols fridges in the world and energy changes are also needed but THOSE COST HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY to deal with the LESSER causes...what everyone SHOULD do and be told is EATING MEAT AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS causes the main climate change...besides destroying wildlife the most and harming our health the most...pollution...from air stench of manure...causes BILLIONS of COST to health services to treat asthma...DEMENTIA alzheimer is highest amoungst FARM WORKERS and people living rural smelling that unnatural stench. The UN has stated...animal agriculture is the MAIN contributor to climate change emissions more than transport.<br /><br />1 kilogram of beef is responsible for the equivalent of the amount of CO2 emitted by the average European car every 250 kilometres, and burns enough energy to light a 100-watt bulb for nearly 20 days (New Scientist magazine, 18 July 2007, page 15 ). another easy comparison...A kilogram of beef is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution than driving for 3 hours while leaving all the lights on back home. <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526134-500-meat-is-murder-on-the-environment/"">https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526134-500-meat-is-murder-on-the-environment/</a><br /><br />&quot;A global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty and the worst impacts of climate change, a UN report said.<br /><br />As the global population surges towards a predicted 9.1 billion people by 2050, western tastes for diets rich in meat and dairy products are unsustainable, says the report from United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) international panel of sustainable resource management.<br /><br />It says: “Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.”<br /><br />Professor Edgar Hertwich, the lead author of the report, said: “Animal products cause more damage than [producing] construction minerals such as sand or cement, plastics or metals. Biomass and crops for animals are as damaging as [burning] fossil fuels.”<br /><br />Now we really are head in sand...if we think telling other people in China and India who are BILLIONS getting richer so copying the Western diets of flesh...that THEY should go extinct and leave the minority of us to continue destroying our health and animal lives to not destroy the planet even more than WE have done so far....it is OBVIOUS that the world cannot continue this holocaust that is causing destruction of our planet and affecting the poorest the worst and destroying all real wildlife out there.

""Entire nations will be wiped off the map by rising sea levels by theyear 2000"" The quote was made by Noel Brown, an official at the UN, and it was an indirect quote as far as I can see. However, you seem to misrepresent the indirect quote because you replace the word ""could"" with ""will,"" and you leave out ""if global warming is not reversed"" between the words ""levels"" and ""by,"" thus implying that (1) there is not stopping it and that (2) such a catastrophic event will occur by the year 2000 rather than sometime later after 2000 if no great action is taken by 2000. As this video demonstrates, climate change is pretty much irreversible, so he's not wrong if he did say that since there is still much time to find out, and as Dr. Hansen said, there has been more goals than actions. That said, Noel Brown is not the best source of information. 2. ""Or that one time 10 years ago when NASA scientist James Hansen said that Obama only had 4 years to fix it..."" The quote by Dr. Hansen is misleading. He made it right before Obama's inauguration, so Dr. Hansen was referring to Obama's term in which he can take action, and it wasn't a climate prediction. Dr. Hansen has since been quite critical of Obama because of Obama's lack of great action, and he will talk about it in his upcoming book. 3. ""Or that one time in 1972 when they warned us for global cooling (Yes, you read that right, go look it up)"" Who is they? Scientists aren't some infallible monolithic being and they can mean 1 person or 1000 persons, so it's important to specify who. That said, most of the papers published during that time predicted warming. For more information, take a look at this paper: http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/131047.pdf 4. ""Or what about before that, in the 1950s when there was the global warming scare again?"" Since this was a ""scare,"" it probably isn't very reliable. How about taking a look at the papers published during that time. eg. http://www.rescuethatfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Plass-1956e.pdf 5. ""Nevermind the fact that it's been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the IPCC is falsifying statistics left and right.... Oh you haven't heard of this? I know, you're reflex is to ask me for links. You lazy shit. And you wonder why people are ill informed. Hilarious."" What I find particularly ironic about this claim that the IPCC tells us that it's modified, how it's modified, and why it is modified, which means you don't understand those reasons, in which case you are probably ill-informed of climate science, you don't know those reasons, in which case you are ill-informed, or you are told that it has been ""falsified"" and you believe it, in which case you are also ill-informed. And why are you so hostile to sharing your sources? Wouldn't that attitude breed even more ignorance? 6. ""But hey, the mainstream media is not in control of a handfull of people and they would never lie to you.... Amirite?"" Who are the five people in control of all mainstream media outlets? In addition, even if they lied, you can check their sources and reveal that lie, in which case they will likely retract that claim since that's journalistic practice. Alternative media is not better, however, and can sometimes be worse. 7. ""Let's totally forget that the earth has never in recorded history been this green due to CO2 increases (source: NASA)"" In the NASA press release, they say: ""While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events. The beneficial impacts of carbon dioxide on plants may also be limited, said co-author Dr. Philippe Ciais, associate director of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, Gif-suv-Yvette, France. 'Studies have shown that plants acclimatize, or adjust, to rising carbon dioxide concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time.' "" 8. ""Hmm... I guess thats what that 2.5 kg CO2 bottle is doing hooked up to my heavily planted aquarium which grows so fast I literally have to trim kilo's every month. Nah, with all those predictions and absolutely nothing fishy going on, I'm feeling confident in saying: Well, they may not have known before when they thought they knew it all, but surely they do know now. You can only be wrong so many times, amirite?"" Again, scientists aren't some monolithic being spouting one viewpoint. 1, 2, and 3 are misleading, and 4 is kind of idiotic. 9. ""And whatever you do, never look into solar forcing, and how papers are coming out on a daily basis completely disproving the old concensus that 'The sun only varies 0,1% in it's output' "" I'm not sure what you are referring to here.

While you are correct that the climate change is locked in, what you fail to mention is that in the year 3000, life as we know it will have been LOOOOOONNNNNGGG gone. <br /><br />The Arctic ice might last until 2022.......but, probably not. Once that ice is gone, it is going to alter the jet stream in strange ways. While they don&#39;t know, or can&#39;t say how exactly it&#39;s going to react, the best guess is that it&#39;s going to shift it&#39;s center of rotation to be over Greenland, instead of the North Pole. This will be because at that point, Greenland will become the coldest point of the northern hemisphere, and.....well...heat always, flows from warm to cold, so, logically, once the Arctic ice is gone, and is warmer than Greenland, the jet stream will shift its center of rotation around Greenland. Makes sense to me. This of course will only be during the time that the Arctic is actually warmer than Greenland, which will be for a very short period of time, the first time it goes ice free, but will last longer and longer each year, until it&#39;s eventually ice free year round, which will likely be around ten years after the first blue ocean event. <br /><br />What that will mean for our crops, is most likely disaster, on a global scale. No matter where you grow crops, if it&#39;s too hot, too cold, too wet, or too dry, that is the end for your crops. The jet stream is already completely messed up. Once it shifts its rotation center, the weather is likely to be even more crazy than it already is......to say the least. <br /><br />Who knows? It could even everything out, and make perfect weather everywhere! They don&#39;t know.....that&#39;s pretty much impossible to predict. But, they do know it&#39;s going to change things, likely in a largely unfavorable way, and it&#39;s going to happen very, very soon. <br /><br />It&#39;s kind of hard to feed 8 billion people without food.",UCgdcu13ifI5H3J64E1Ug-8A,0,Ugxu6h3Z-CLvc44KtMB4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

I am a Ph.D. scientist who gives climate change lectures to the general public about 30 times a year and I have been doing so for about a decade. I regularly engage with online climate deniers like you who say ""It is the Sun stupid!!"" and ask them to provide data to back up their statement. Specifically I ask for solar data to explain the observed increase in global temps since 1980 and how that corresponds with observed temperature measurements over that same period of time. I then keep track of how many of them a) try to provide data to support their assertion, b) provide data that actually does support the observed temperature measurements and c) those who prevaricate, dodge, and otherwise do everything they can to avoid being caught in their lie. After doing this for nearly three years the numbers are: a) 12 b) 0 c) 72 Thanks for participating in my survey (I share the results with my audiences). Congratulations Mr. Perez*, you have now boosted the number of ""c"" to 73 and helped to confirm my theory that climate change deniers spend most of their time parroting each other and rarely, if ever, bother to dig into the data to try and defend their positions (which are based on ideology and not science)!

""What do u mean no restrictions? "" IF it was about co2, they would have restriction on it to be used to lower co2. Instead people are allowed to use to build up their military or to buy materials to make nuclear weapons. ""they did"" They did NOT. Many of the others were suppose to raise money to lower co2? out of the trillions dollars they raised, you want to know how much all of them used to lower co2? 5 to 7 MILLION. Yea, they planted a few trees, mostly in areas were they were being cut down, and those trees got cut down decade later. Something you might not realize is that most trees are cut down in areas where they replant so that they will have more trees the next harvest. The majority of the money just went to pay for some of those trees the logging companies would normally have paid for. In other words, it did nothing. IN only a few places, they went in to a company that was putting out pollution and make it produce less pollution. That was the only areas they did any good. It was so little. ""one will use the money to build nuclear weapons."" They can. In case you did not hear, little rocket man was building nuclear missiles. He set off several nuclear devices underground. He fired off several test rockets that had the capacity to reach most of the way to the US and one at least had the capacity to  hit Alaska. NK is suppose to get 10's of millions of dollars and they have no restriction on how they use it. "" It's science. Just like climate change."" Answer this. IF it is science why do they REFUSE to use antifraud standard scientific procedures? The first thing you are taught in science (or used to be) is that if you change your system of measurement it will always lead to failure. Here is a simple example. One of my science teachers used baking as an example. He showed us the recipe for a cake, and had us (as a class) bake one. The thing is, while we were measuring it, in the middle he switch the measuring instruments from English to metric. The result was a totally ruined cake. Try it if you do not believe. Try to bake a cake using English measurements for the first half of the ingredients and metric for the last or vice versa. Michael Mann and other alarmist use proxy data until 1950, then switch to instruments. IF you continue to use the proxies, they ALL show a down turn AFTER 1950. Instruments go the other way. The result is a hockey stick shaped graph. Another failed attempt is to show a graph of the sea level and use 3 points to make a curve. It has been proven that there is a 60 year cycle in the sea levels, It isn't much, but its there. IF you use the top of one cycle the bottom of another cycle and the top of a third, you get a curve that looks like it is increasing, but that does not match facts. The last 5 years had a TOTAL increase of 2mm. According to the graph, it should be increasing at a rate of 8 mm per year. Another failure is to ignore other science. More than half of the suppose sea level increase is due to land sinking. New York, Boston and most other east coast areas are sinking, but those are the areas they use to prove that man is responsible for a disastrous sea level rise. ""US is nowhere NEAR where they should be in terms of climate goals."" Yes we are. In the Paris Accord we were suppose to be beneath the 2005 levels, and we are. No other country can say that. Most countries have started using coal power plants after the failure of solar and wind and nuclear. ""All the scientists in the world how's that? "" Can  you prove it? No, you can't. There are 7 studies done by political scientists that do NOT prove that the majority of scientist agree. They just pretend they do. ""If you wanna listen to the people, why not go medicare for all?""

So basicly all countries in the UN can make could've made restrictions(they did) and the US is the largest country in the UN so they actually are the least restricted.

The planet goes though what is called the Milankovitch cycle. This is where the earth is in the best position of the earth to receive the most energy. That means it is closest to the sun and at the best angle for the earth to absorb energy. During the Holocene maximum, the southern pole was pointed in the right direction to receive the most heat BUT it was farther away from the sun. So yes, it received less energy than it would now. BUT the over all effect is that we got 3% more energy year round than we do now. In 5000 years, we will get 3% less energy year round than we do now. THAT will put us in a full blown glaciation. So yes, the Holocene Maximum DID matter. For one thing, there is not that much land in the southern hemisphere as the north. That means life is not affected as much now as it was then when the north was getting the most energy. ""For instance, there was way more oxygen in the jurassic period"" Yes, and a lot more co2 for the plants to grown and thus more food for animals. What you do not seem to understand is the co2 is NECESSARY for plants and we are so low they are starving. The reason o2 is so low is the plants are not getting the co2 they need. Yes, animals of the Jurassic period would not survive today, because there is no enough plants for them to survive on, not to mention that since the Himalayan mountains were created, the temperature has been too cold for animals like that. That is why we are in an ice age. The Himalayans froze because they got so high and Antarctica froze because its over the south pole and the water does not circulate there because of that.

It is true that the earth was warmer, but only in its nothern hemisphere. In fact, the sothern hemispehere was COLDER during the holocene maximum than it is now. So the holocene maximum doesnt matter, both because you misunderstood it, and because that's not the same as the human impact we see today. A warmer climate wouldn't end life on earth, but it would force all creatures on earth to adapt. And adaptation doesn't come in nearly the same rate as we humans increase the global temerature. The climate can change without problem, the problem is the rate of which this climate change is happening. For instance, there was way more oxygen in the jurassic period.

That's because the other states and other countries use antifire procedures that are prohibited by California law because they ""remove the natural beauty of the forest"". Instead of the Forest Department being able to do controlled burns to get rid of under bush and dead trees, California governor Brown refused to allow it because it was better to be part of nature. Then when the fires happen, there is no controlling them. ""all those weather extremes all over the world?"" Not a single weather extreme is unusual. Hurricanes are SLIGHTLY fewer than before (not statistically significantly), forest fires (outside of California) are smaller and fewer than other decades, droughts are smaller duration and weaker intensity than history shows them to be. Tornadoes are down, esp. the more powerful ones. There are fewer cold snaps than ever, and fewer heat waves. So where are all the extremes you talk about?

All the test they have ever done were deliberately skewed to show the co2 increases in temperature. That was their purpose to showcase that co2 CAN cause a warming. It doesn't necessary prove that it does. IN a controlled environment, you can heat wood to several times its burn temperature, without it ever catching fire. Does that mean wood does not burn? NO, it means that if you control the environment  you can achieve what ever you want it to. EVERY test of co2 ability to heat the environment involved water vapor. They also used some means of preventing the heat from escaping, either by convection or radiation. The atmosphere has no such limitation. Here is a shocker for you. NASA has proven that co2 increases cool the Antarctic. Counter intuitive if you believe that co2 traps heat. Allow me to explain why it does so. Co2 emits infrared. In areas outside the Antarctic you have water or land t hat will absorb any that goes downwards. In no place on earth is there anything above a certain level that will absorb outbound infrared. In the Antarctic anything that goes downwards reflects off the ice and goes into space. In the rest of the world, the amount of infrared being radiated by the earth in the tiny part of the frequency that co2 can absorbs has already been absorbed. There is no more outbound energy that will be absorbed by co2. On the other hand, co2 can absorb energy from other molecules, primary water vapor and can radiate it in both directions. When it sends it up, it escapes. When it goes down it gets reabsorbed. IF you increase co2, you speed this  up. That means the ground gets a little warmer, but the upper atmosphere gets 2x cooler.

The result is that the ocean are now warmer and the land where the ice WAS is not warmer. So the earth average temperature is now higher. That is what we are seeing. Let me reverse that. How is global warming causing the ice to melt? So how does it do that? According to the alarmist, co2 prevents the energy from escaping FORCING the ice to melt. But how does the co2 do so? By absorbing the energy that is radiated by the earth. BUT if the earth is not radiating the energy, the co2 is not going to be able to absorb it. IF the ice is melting, it is storing the energy, thus preventing it from being radiated back to space. Basically, all they are doing is adding another step into what is already there and claiming that is the cause. IF man was causing the earth to warm, what happened before co2 shot up after 1950? Why was most of the warming of the last 350 years before co2 increased? IF co2 is causing the ice to melt, why did the vast majority of that melt occur before co2 skyrocketed?

Theories are based on things such as suppositions. In the case of agw, it is based on the atmosphere having a sensitivity of greater than 2°C. IF the atmospheric sensitivity is less than .5°, then man is not responsible for global warming. Every model based on sensitivity of greater than .5 have been proven wrong because they can not track the temperature changes. In the 1940's they had started looking for patterns in the climate, and discovered that the British Royal Navy had tracked temperature world wide since the early 1800's. In the more than 100 years of records, they found there was 60 year cycle they could not explain at the time. They also found that every 60 years, the temperatures went up for 30 years, and it was about .6° in the 30 years, then a cooling of about .05° in 30 years. So they theories that something was causing a normal .09° per decade .9°C per century). So they started looking for what could be causing it. They came up with the idea of glaciers melting. Ice absorbs energy and becomes water, then the water absorbs more energy and increase in temperature. They got the Allied military, who had a lot of aircraft crews needing training and not much to train them on, to take pictures of glaciers so they could get an accurate reading on how much ice there was. They then calculated the loss of ice and the heating of that water. The result was they found the 0.09° that was causing global warming. This means that the theory of glacial melt causing global warming has 100% fact supporting it. Agw as a theory has ""facts"" that have been disproven to be true.

Light water nuclear reactors that use solid uranium oxide fuel rods can only use about 0.5% of the uranium in the rods before becoming structurally unsound, this is because a Xenon isotope is one of the products and being a gas, it requires much more volume than it&#39;s predecessors and hence form gaps and fissures within the fuel rods. The plan was to remanufacture these fuel rods back into solid rods for further use and Europe did build these remanufacturing plants but due to anti-nuclear pressure in the States, the Carter administration cancel the US remanufacturing plant. This means that in the US, the nuclear waste is almost entirely unused uranium and other transuranic isotopes with half lives well in excess of 30,000 years. These products are less radioactive than the actual byproducts of fission but must be isolated from the environment for well over 30,000 years while the actual byproducts of fission, not only are less voluminous but only need be isolated for about 350 years. Also, CO2 capture presumed that the CO2 would stay in the reservoirs they are pumped into and there are indications this does not happen. Microfissures particularly from fracking allows the CO2 to leak back into our environment, this has been measured particularly in ground water and there is a company employing passive seismic to try and map the microfissures. What carbon remains sequestered are the ones that react with the surrounding minerals forming stable carbonates. A more reliable carbon sequestration method would be biochar where only the carbon is sequestered but of course industry does not like the idea of using energy to liberate oxygen from the carbon when their whole point was to liberate energy by allowing oxygen to react with the carbon in the first place. I would agree that even with cessation of fossil fuel use, climate change would not half and indeed we may have already exceeded the interglacial metastability so the climate may just progress to a warmer state on natural positive feedbacks such as permafrost and clathrate meltings but I would suggest that technical methods of addressing the situation could be more dangerous than climate change itself hence not only are a Deus ex machina technical solution unlikely but quite risky. I do agree that we have to pursue conservation and a shift to carbon free technologies to at least mitigate the situation which seems to be your intended statement however, I&#39;m not willing to give up meat in my diet, perhaps suitable imitations of meat or bioprinted meat. We&#39;ve been able to bioprint a beating mouse heart with a modified inkjet printer (Woods Institute) so shouldn&#39;t a bioprinted steak or chicken breast be possible... <br /><br />Transportation could technologically be carbon free without replacing a single vehicle. Fuels suitable to replace gasoline and diesel are obviously available from biologic sources but actual gasoline and diesel could readily be synthesized from syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases and indeed this is done in our refineries to improve the quality of the product produced. However, just as it takes energy to liberate hydrogen from water, it takes energy to liberate carbon monoxide from carbon dioxide and that energy would have to be from a clean source. However, the claim to an environmentally friendly transportation through EV&#39;s and hydrogen fueled vehicles are just as possible with existing vehicles and fuel delivery infrastructure. It&#39;s just that auto manufacturers could invite more consumer sales with EV&#39;s and hydrogen fueled cars while carbon neutral fuel processes would only increase costs for refineries and compete with their core business model of fossil sourced feedstock. Batteries, and hydrogen are just chemically stored energy just as gasoline and diesel are. The problem with transportation isn&#39;t technology or even existing vehicles, they are social economic problems. Many carbon neutral concepts simply provide too little profit and/or offset existing business models for corporations to pursue.",UCGaGCZICjDZtVZbqrjvAmeA,0,UgzAQyeUikgwXh8L1R14AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

They and healthy Oceans (that support plant life both large and very small) are what give planet Earth its oxygen and remove Carbon Dioxide (EARTH&#39;s Oxygen, not Man&#39;s). This is MUCH cheaper and better than a for-profit, suspect method of &quot;Carbon Capture&quot;.<br /><br />The breathable atmosphere is little more than 3.5 miles thick. Eighteen thousand feet (and above) is when aircraft pilots must be in pressurized aircraft or use oxygen tanks.<br />Trees are still being cut down at a record pace. The Amazon Jungle, for instance, is disappearing at alarming rates due to repeal of exotic lumber trade and exporting greed (I&#39;m sorry, exporting &quot;capitalism&quot;) to countries. In the USA, the average worker works much harder and must borrow far more just to maintain quality of life. It is a precarious position and often means very long work hours to protect oneself just from being fired.<br />And Oceans? Well, there are still plenty of idiots killing Sharks &quot;for safety&quot;. Fishing has become industrialized with all the lobbying power of an oil company and MASSIVE waste of a resource that should be renewable except greed is outpacing it.<br />Some countries still hunt Whales and Japan (one of those countries) is also hunting a Tuna species to near extinction but storing them frozen until their rarity drives up the Market Price. Insanity, all of it.<br />Why then, all this madness? Well, it is exremely profitable for a very small few who &quot;control the messaging&quot; to get people to work long hours then purchase glittery or otherwise superficial products to replace the emptiness. This is not &quot;good enough&quot; for the truly greedy - they also export jobs to slave-wage locations to increase profit margins but also to create emptiness in slave-wage locations, Now the simple, independent home farmer has a salary and a need to spend: They have no time to be self-sufficient any longer. So, profits grow there as well for the truly greedy.<br />Finally, &quot;Hard Goods&quot;. It used to mean necessary products built to last. It was true in Communist Russia where refrigerator would (literally) work for 30 years with little service. Electronic Appliances could and should last a very long time but there is not LARGE profits in that, only mere profit. So they, like the incandescent light bulb are not &quot;built to last&quot; but to &quot;wear out&quot; at a rate acceptable to the buyer and as profitable as possible to the seller.<br />So?

That there are desired policy outcomes. But one thing, what if there really is a problem or even a potential problem? It would be indistinguishable from the current situation where scientists get grant money from the government. Billion dollar climate modelling efforts? Why he never mentions one by name? Kind of a huge deal, isn't it? *""They become spokepersons for the community, whether community likes it or not""* And you send me Richard Lindzen, person who went to the public to spew out an opinion? 2. Why didn't he show the entire conversation in the leaked emails? Why he chose to take a quote from only one email? It's like cherrypicking start and end points in a temperature graph and not paying attention what came before or after. Again, kind of a big deal he strangely lacked details of. 3. He starts with the premise that there is a bias, and explain who would it benefit (although it doesn't make sense, see point below). All he has done is take quotes out of context (as far as we know) 4. He makes a claim that would apply to every scientific field funded by the government. Only climate is under question? And this is how science has worked for a long time and gotten us to the modern technological society we live. All of a sudden, when something doesn't conform to their world view, it's a conspiracy? 5. The premise doesn't make sense. Desired policy outcomes would mean nothing against the money they have to spend for research which is wrong by deafult. What is the current narrative? Less polluting tech. That's the desired policy outcome? They want more power? They will not get from climate policies, they have to turn for other fields which are not under question. How in the world does it make sense? 6. He doesn't show which climate models are running twice as hot. Even if there are some, he didn't mention the ones that are prefectly fine. It's confirmation bias. 7. Rate of change isn't noticable by a human in their lifetimes? That's *current* rate of change. It's not linear. And it's also irrelevant to his topic. It doesn't highlight a bias. 8. Extreme weather hasn't gotten worse? Citation needed. 9. He uses ""science"" and ""media"" interchangeably. 10. Few papers don't mean anything. (Besides Curry is a knows climate misinformer and went straight to the public to tell the she is ""ostracised"" because she dared to publish some contradictory, but in reality, her research was just flawed and hse didn't accept it.) Few papers don't show anything unless the conclusions are confirmed by others. For example, if one research finds the answer is 3 but everybody else find it's 6 or 7, it doesn't mean 3 is the correct answer. That's confirmation bias... again. 11. Why are the present models (that supposedly warm the Earth twice the rate compared to reality) never mentioned anywhere? And even then, what about all the other models? 12. First he says the climate isn't on public's radar screen (9:10), the public isn't alarmed. That's counter to the entire point he is trying to make in the video. Now Lindzen, he basically sayd other scientists don't account for other natural forcings and they aren't well understood. This is complete bull. Every scientists talking about climate understands that climate changes due to multible of factors. Lindzen is just telling half the story. What the ""groups"" agree on is basically correct, scientists do agree on those point. But they can be misinterpreted by people trying to prove either side. That's why you need to tell the whole story. No evidence... by which he means those fancy models that recreate 20th century climate almost perfectly? Yea...

The most recent de-glacial transition phase, while similar in temperature and increases in CO2 levels, was “two orders of magnitude slower than current anthropogenic change.” The period 56 million years ago known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum was determined to be the closest future analog. This period of sustained CO2 release was associated with a decline in ocean pH of between 0.25 and 0.45 units. However, current acidification is occurring at almost 10 times this rate. Historically sustained periods of acidification and CO2 increase — which were similar but not as extreme as the last 1,000 years — have led to the collapse of coral reefs and, in one instance, to the *extinction of 96% of marine life.* You *hope* it doesn't kill us and I *hope* you are right.

Yes, I said so low. One was 300 million years ago, and the other ended in 1950's when man began to pump more co2 into the air which the plants need to survive. In the first one, almost all larger life forms died out during an ice age. If co2 levels ever drop much below 180, its unlikely life will survive. There will not be enough to keep plants alive and if they die, so do animals. If you read glaciology peer review magazines, you find that the glaciers have been retreating since the little ice hit bottom in 1650. You would also find that our current warming is not unusual. IF on the other hand you read only the pal reviewed climate magazines, you will be told that co2 has never been this high and higher temperature will wipe us out. You will be told that glaciers only started retreating during the last 70 years. If you read oceanography peer review magazine you will find evidence of the little ice age and several warming period. If you read pal review climate magazine, you will see they never existed because they ….? I guess because the pal reviewer say they didn't exist so they cant have existed despite tons of evidence. If you read marine biology peer review magazines, you find tons of articles about the real causes of dead zones and the fish that die there. You will find articles about pollution and other things killing reefs using lab test to confirm all their theories, and not one of them mentioned co2.

Basically, what they did was make an agreement to buy all the electricity for the city from a group of windmill operators that had already built the windmills. During the day, they draw every thing from a large area of windmills and if one area shuts down due to low wind speed, they draw their energy from another. Here is the problem. In countries like Denmark, where they use only wind and solar, they had to build so much of them so make sure they always had the electricity that on MOST days, half of them are shut down. Why? Because they have too great a production capability. At night, its worse. Most of the wind is at night, and yet their demands are down. So 70% of their capacity is wasted. The result, their electric bills are 10+ times what they are in the US. Businesses that are dependent on electricity have gone bankrupt or moved to other countries.

There are two ways that a study SHOULD report these as the standard scientific procedures outline. Either they state ""out of 4000 paper 97% support agw"", or they state ""32% of 14000"". They did not want to use the 4k because it would highlight how few people were making those claims. They did not want to say 32% because that would destroy the pretense that it was a consensus. ""rarely mention how they relate to the current warming."" Exactly. They looked at natural warming, and if they showed how the warming was natural, it proves that the current warming is natural. ""they just don't mention it in the abstract."" So why were their papers counted as supporting agw. The report did not state the scientist support, but the papers supported agw. ""you just seem to be p-hacking to find the lowest percentage support based on some pretty shaky reasoning"" I do not know what p-hacking is, but the reality is a paper like this should find the lowest percentage support. Scientifically speaking, you do not count things like a report proving media bias towards agw as proof of support for agw. MANY of the ones that did not say which way they were leaning did the same thing. They were trying to be balance and were counted as support because they mentioned man made global warming but did not come out and say they were against it. ""You also dismiss the fact that Oreskes, Verheggen, Doran and others have found similar levels of agreement as Cook "" No, I am not dismissing the fact that they faked it just as Cook did. Oreskes stated that she counted you as support if you did not say you were against. That is contrary to standard scientific procedures, and against standard mathematical statistical analysis procedures. Basically, the way she did it, she should have stated she found 3% against it and left it at that. THAT would have been accurate. One of the studies asked 12 questions only one, the very last, had anything to do with co2 and that was ""is co2 a ghg"". The first 11 had nothing to do with it. The first simply asked if people thought the temperature had increased since the 1900, yet her conclusion was about 1950 and beyond. No where did she asked anything to do with 1950. The second asked if man had CONTRIBUTED (note that this could mean as little as 1%) to climate change (note she did not indicate if it was positive or negative). She asked these of STUDENTS studying building dams, and they knew that they effected the climate around them. She asked students studying agriculture science and they knew that agriculture affects the climate. She asked students studying building cities and they know of heat island effects and micro climates. Most science will effect the climate in some manner. So of course 97% agree. YET despite her study claiming that these SCIENTIST believed that man made co2 was responsible for the majority of the warming since the 1950's. Another study did nothing more than say that she did it right. Nothing in this did it right. ""as Delingpole demonstrates pretty well here."" That  has nothing to do with what I was doing because I gave actual information from those studies to prove how they did it wrong. ""you'll see why I don't trust bloggers on the internet for my science."" You should not trust ANYONE. You should do the research for yourself then you will see the lies.

Most papers on climate change generally look into past mechanisms and rarely mention how they relate to the current warming. That doesn't necessarily mean they disagree with the impact human CO2 emissions. In fact many of the scientists that author these papers support the current consensus based on the findings of their research, they just don't mention it in the abstract.

We are harming the planet with pollution and such, but co2 is not a pollutant. How do you harm the planet with a plant food? What good does sulfur and mercury do for the planet? Dead zones are bad, but blaming it on co2 removes the pressure to fix the real problem. We are turning large parts of the world to desert, but blaming co2 is getting in the way of fixing that. Sceptics are not the ones standing in the way of progress, but alarmist that are trying to focus the attention away from the real problems and pushing for solution that do nothing but make them rich. How much pollution do you think is stopped by people like al gore running around the planet in his jumbo jet giving speeches that do nothing but make him richer. I used to argue global warming on a forum that was supposedly about science. The person I argued with most was a guy that lived in a large house, paid for by a number of books he had written on global warming, and buy speeches he gave every month around the US. During the summer, when he wasnt speaking, he would drive 100 miles to a lake in an over powered car and spend his weekend sailing around the lake, polluting the waters. All the luxuries he had were gained because of books and speeches on how bad the american people are for pumping co2 into the air. He pushed hard for a carbon tax, and I doubt anyone at any of his lectures knew that he had stock in carbon tax credit trading companies. Every dollar of a carbon tax put pennies in his hand, but no one saw that there was a conflict of interest in someone getting paid by the tax collector and him pushing for more tax. That is what it is all about. They want us to pay them for nothing more than hot air. All the while, they are dumping all kinds of pollutants in the air and water, like so2, and mercury. So, no, I am not against stopping the real pollution and I am very aware of the damage we do to this planet, but ignoring the real problem and focusing on a smoke screen doesn't fix anything.

It is also clear from the start that you didn't want to talk you wanted to argue. Your mind is closed and you're drunk on severly mistaken delusions of intellectual grandeur.

""blah, blah blah, insult, insult, insult, blah blah blah"". Try to act like an adult every once in a while. ""Thise reports were wirtten by scientists for scientists. The reason they do not ask about CO2 is because that is generally accepted and really outside her purveiw of the survey."" You obviously have no clue. These reports were NOT made for scientist, they were written for the public. The entire purpose was to convince the public that scientist believe this bs. IF you read the report, it says exactly that in the abstract. Yes, you do have to have a connection between the warming and co2 if that is your conclusion but she made none. She deliberately did not ask it because the people that she asked would have seen other causes for global warming. Plus she was NOT a scientist. She was a student studying political communication, i.e. spin doctoring. She did not talk to climatologist, but rather agriculture science students, engineering students and such. That was another lie she made, by claiming that she talk to scientist, rather than students. In case you do not know, agriculture students have to study the effects of agriculture on local climates. Students studying building of dams have to study the effect the dams have on local environment. Students studying the building of structures are required to study the effect the building and its surrounding changes cause to the environment. The law requires all of this to be part of the curriculum. So if you ask anyone of them if they believe that man has caused a change to the environment, they will tell you chapter and verse how their fields have change the climate, and not a one will mention co2. If co2 as the cause of global warming, then her conclusion was outside the purview. ""because they do not specifically mention it to you that is evidence that the majority of climate scientists reject that CO2"" No, what I have is evidence that she faked the study. All of them do. There is no evidence that they reject or accept BUT the standard scientific procedures is not to make a stand on it unless you know it is one or the other. I have never claimed that the majority of scientist reject it. I have stated multiple times that there is no evidence they support and that is the truth. I do deny that they have proof that they support. ""That is now proof that it didnt happen, but instead that it did."" It happen, but it didn't happen? And I need to learn to read? The point is, the little ice age cooled off the planet and it is getting warmer since. The little ice age was colder than the earth should so when it ended of course the earth warmed and that is why it is warming now. Co2 did not cause the cooling, nor did it cause the warming since. ""Do you have evidence that NASA is holding out "" Yes, their reports state that water vapor is a positive feedback. No where do they even discuss the possibility that it is a negative feedback. YET even their experts tell them that it can have a negative feedback. The only way to have a sensitivity of 3 or more is to disregard all negative feedbacks. No model with a feedback lower than 3 can create anything close to the risk factor they insist on warning about. YET no model that has anything higher than a 1 is even close to the actual measured temperatures. ""And again with the clouds as if they spontaniously just ping up in the sky with no force driving them... "" SERIOUSLY? what drives them up is something you might have heard of if you ever took your fingers out of your ears, called the *SUN*. Believe it or not but it has been proven that the sun can cause clouds to ""spontaneously just ping up in the sky"". It does not require co2 at all. ""The use of proxy methods of measuing past climate is out of necessity as reliable records on the weather only go a few centuries back and become more sparce and cover less of the globe as they do so"" Yes, but the proxies did not stop the minute the instruments came out. The fact of the matter is, if you continue to use the proxies, they greatly diverge from the instruments. This is because they proxies they use do not track temperature but climate. Dendrochronology is the study of data from tree ring growth. Dendrochologist will tell you that those reading can not be used to determine temperature, but Michael Mann did exactly that. He is not a dendrochologist, but pretends he knows more than they do. ""There is much we can learn about the past climate, how freak season-long weather conditions, or periods of *climate change* have affected tree growth"" https://www.environmentalscience.org/dendrochronology-tree-rings-tell-us Note that this says climate change, not temperature. Yet it was a graph of temperature that Michael Mann created using tree rings and it was thermometer readings he tacked on the end before discarding the proxy data because it went in the wrong direction. ""I have noting to loose"". No, you dont because you already lost your ability to use logic, your ability to think for yourself and any semblance of dignity respectability and maturity. The only thing you possibly have left is your religion.

My only criticism of the video is the lack of dates telling what date each frame represents. Of course Hicks will dismiss this as a lie as well. And the gloval cooling concensus that Hicks predictably regurgitates? Well guess what. Another fib. An extract: ""An enduring popular myth suggests that in the 1970s the climate science community was predicting “global cooling” and an “imminent” ice age, an observation frequently used by those who would undermine what climate scientists say today about the prospect of global warming. A review of the literature suggests that, on the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists' thinking as being one of the most important forces shaping Earth's climate on human time scales. More importantly than showing the falsehood of the myth, this review describes how scientists of the time built the foundation on which the cohesive enterprise of modern climate science now rests."" The link: https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1 And I can do civil. But Hicks doesn't want a discussion.

It would make algae oil cheaper than fossil fuel. They would no longer have to give money to oil producing countries but would have a monopoly.

"" It would have to be massive since it has been saying the same thing for over 60 years. FF has never changed its stance. It has done so without spending any money to do so. On the opposite side, alarmist are constantly changing their stance. They spend 100 billions of OUR money to convince people that we have to do what they want us do to, which mostly is to give them more money. Every prediction ff companies have said, has come true. Every prediction alarmist make are proven false. Scientist do not have to be honest any more than politicians do. Yet they can be and still support agw because the reality is, most of the ones supporting agw do so because its the only way they get paid. When I was in high school, in the 70's, I was in speech class. Every semester, out teacher would randomly assign topics out of a bag and pick two people at random to debate the topic. At the end of the semester, we would debate that topic and our grade would be based on how well we did. When it was discovered that my topic was global COOLING, man made or natural, AND I was on the natural side of the debate, I was in formed I could pass with only bringing up a single point of question that would put it even slightly in question. Instead I won the debate. In my research, I found that scientist in the 1940's had begun studying the record of the British Royal Navy. These record contained temperature readings from every part of the world for well over a century at that point. American recording only went back 60 years but it validated the records the British took. Other countries had shorter periods of readings as well that supported them. The result was they discovered there was a 60 year stair step pattern. They called it the temperature oscillation. At that time they could not discover the cause of the pattern, but years later it was discovered that there is a strong correlation between the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter with that cycle. It is not proof, but certainly a possibility. What got them concerned was the regular increase in temperature that was underlying it. Over the years, there have been several other patterns, such as 24, 12 and 8 year cycles. When these cycles are all taken out, you get a straight line graph of .9°C per century. In 30 years, the 60 year cycle will cause a warming of .6°C, then a drop of .05°C in 30 years. The result is that every 60 years since the records were found, the earth has warmed about .55°C. IF you continue that graph into the future from where they were, you get something that is very close to what the actual readings have shown. IF you continue that until the year 2100, it would only have an increase in the temperature of 1.8°C above 1900 temperatures. The alarmist say we have to keep the temperature no higher than 2° above the 1880 mark. Notice any connection? The alarmist also tell us that we have to give them tons of money to keep the temperature from going any higher than that. The scientist wanted to try to find out what was calling the .9°C per century. Since ww2 had ended the allies had a lot of planes with crews that needed to continue to train, as well as ground crew, including the people that read the pictures reconnaissance planes took. So they were more than happy to have their crew photograph glaciers and such. Using these and proxies, they were able to discover that the cause of the warming was the melting of the glaciers. All of this happen at a time when the co2 was only 280-290 ppm. The earth has continued to warm at .9° since the 1940's, in leaps ever 30 years. Between 1970 and 2000, the climate rose .6°C Since then, it has arguably cooled as much as .05°. It will not start to warm up until 2030, and if the solar minimum does not start then, the warming will begin again. This is what is meant by real science. Models created in the 1940's long before the ff companies even had any kind of control, are reasonably close to the real temperature, while models are off by as much as 1°C in 17 years. Altering data to match your predictions is not science, but religion. Demanding everyone accept your decrees or face prison or death is not science, but religion. Consensus is not science. Insulting those that do not accept your logic is not science, but childish prattle based on religion zealotry. You can not prove agw with repeatable test. You can not prove that shellfish are dying from co2 with proven test results. You can prove they died from lack of o2 due to algae blooms cause by over use of fertilizer and you can do so with repeatable lab test. You can not prove co2 is causing bleaching of reefs with repeatable test results. You can prove that they are the result of water levels falling due to winds caused by El Ninos. You can not prove that the sun is not the cause of the warming because it was the same as it was since the little ice age, because it was also the same as it was in the mwp. You can not prove that co2 is causing the ice to melt, because it is the ice melting that is causing the warming. THAT is physics and THAT is science.

For instance, pushing a lie about there being a consensus without every ask people if they believe the suppose consensus is propaganda. For instance, one of the 7 reports that claim there is 97% consensus never asked anyone if they believed that there was any connection between co2 and changes in the climate, yet her conclusion is that 97% said so. ONLY one question had to do with co2, and that was if it was a ghg. How does co2 being a ghg prove that it is the cause of the warming? Another lie about that, was that she was a season professional in the climate field. At the time of the report she was a STUDENT studying political communication. She did not take one course in climate, yet she is counted as climatologist by the climate magazine peer reviewer list. If that is not good enough, how about the AMA survey, where well over half the members STATED they refused to answer. YET the report the admin pushed was 97% of ALL MEMBERS supported agw. Because they refused to deny it they were counted as supporters. They refused to answer, because to do so would cost them their certification and weather man that does not have AMA certification can not get a job, or will lose the one he has. Meteorologists, as tv weathermen are called these days must be certified to make $100000 a year. Since they have to have bachelor degrees at least, and takes quite some time and expense to get the certification, do you think they will risk their livelihood by saying they do not support? Again, the proper way to say it is that 36% of Meteorologists certified by the AMA support agw, but that is not what the politicians you wanted to hear. If that study is not enough, how about one that gave people multiple votes if they had multiple articles written in certain magazines, fewer if they had any published in other magazines and only one vote if they did not have something published. If someone had published in both types of magazines, they got 8 votes. The thing is, to get accepted for publication in those magazines, it had to be supporting agw. That meant that all the people that published agw support were counted as 8 people, while people that did not support agw were counted as 1. Is it surprising that this study got 83% support? I think its surprising they got that high. Think about it. IF you have 9 people that support agw, that's 81 votes. IF you have 17 people that do not, that means your maximum out of 100 votes is 83. 9/17 is not 83% support.

""The Fisrt Law of Thermodynamics is not selective."" Thank you for making my point. Nothing I said would indicate a destruction of energy, only a conversion from one form to another, which is basic physics. Energy is absorbed via convection and released as radiation in the form of infrared. Infrared can travel in a vacuum so it can escape the earth. IF it could not, the earth would be unlivable. When a molecule radiates it can send it in any direction. When that molecule happens to be above the stratosphere, more than half of that energy will reach space because there is nothing to absorb it unless it is aimed downwards from 1° below the horizon of the molecule to straight down. Alarmist will not admit that the energy will go out ward in the same amount that it goes inward. They have stated that co2 is sending more energy downwards, but that means it is sending more energy outwards as well. They have even stated that satellites have measured an increase in the last few years. ""what you are suggesting is that the extra infra red radiation emitted from that added CO2 just wafts into space"" Actually, as usual, you got it backwards. Alarmist say it ONLY goes downwards, while I say it goes both ways. An increase in co2, means it absorbs more energy via convection and sends that energy in both direction, up and down. ""Welp...."" Wow, those insults do so much to support your cause. The reality is, those models are only able to track the temperature when you alter the data to match the models. NASA and other alarmist have been doing so for years and bragging about it. ""You are aware of albedo. "" Yes, and that is not a feedback of co2. ""So sea ice in teh Arctic is melting, "" According to Al gore, the ice is long gone. IF the models had been right and that was a co2 feedback, they would have disappeared in 2000. 18 years later they are still very much there. So obviously that feedback is not on co2.

So it’s a double whammy… fewer sunspots mean a dimmer sun, which also means more cosmic rays into the atmosphere and more cloud cover which further cools the Earth. And vice-versa when there is more solar activity.""

It seems the 11-year sunspot cycle as well as the increase in solar activity earlier in the 20th century lead to an increase in average global temperature of 0.1 to 0.2 Celsius… which is only about 20% of the observed increase of 0.5 to1.0 degree.""

This one is going to take time. Sunspots are places of high activity on the sun's surface. Magnetism goes crazy around them and they throw out a lot of material that shoots out of the solar system in what is called the solar wind. When it is particularly high, it can cause disruption in the magnetic field surrounding the earth and cause interference in satellite and other electronic systems. It can seriously mess up power lines. It also blocks out cosmic radiation. This gets its name because it comes from outside our solar system. Every cosmic body, including our sun has its own ""fingerprint"" of radiation. Some will be high in red for instance, while others are stronger closer to blue. Some of the radiation in the band causes water vapor to form lower than other wise. Our sun is weak in this ban, so most of our clouds form high. Many other start low and climb because the water droplets are smaller. When the solar wind is weak, the cosmic radiation hits the earth a lot more. This causes the clouds to form lower and stay lower as the droplets are bigger. Low level clouds are more reflective of visible light, and more transparent to infrared. The result is that solar energy is reflected while the black body infrared radiation that the earth releases is able to reach space easier. The result is the earth cools. As it cools more winter ice forms and less is melted during the summer causing glaciers to expands. History and proxies both support that this happened during the little ice age. Between the minimums, the ice began to melt, then expand again when the next minimum hit. Since the middle of the 1600's the glaciers have been mostly retreating. There were two more periods were they slightly expanded but not that much. When the solar wind is strong, the cosmic radiation is blocked and the the clouds form higher and smaller drops. The result is that they create high level clouds. These clouds absorb more visible sunlight warming the atmosphere. They are also more reflective of infrared, preventing the black body radiation from escaping as fast. This results in a warming earth. Thus sunspots are the trigger of global warming, even when they fluctuate, because on the average, there is more high level clouds than low. The LONG TERM lack of sunspots triggers a global cooling because of solar wind, cosmic radiation and low level clouds. ""The Maunder Minimum, also known as the ""prolonged sunspot minimum"", is the name used for the period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare, as was then noted by solar observers."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum There are more about the other minimums if you wish to check them out. ""it was realised that increasing them *might* well have an effeect on the atmosphere."" MIGHT have an effect. It has never been proven. In fact, it is close to being disproven. The point of matter is how sensitive is the atmosphere to increases in co2. It has been known since the 1800's that co2 emits infrared. What alarmist do not want you to know is that the increase in co2 causes an increase in infrared leaving the planet. That is what is called a negative feedback loop. They will talk about positive feedback loops as if they were proven, but none of them are showing up. Clouds can also be a positive or negative feedback depending on if they are high or low and alarmist do not acknowledge that fact. They will tell you that all water vapor is a positive feedback. That is how they justify claiming the sensitivity is 2°C or more (how much the atmosphere will warm due to a doubling of co2). ""Not as good as FEMA camps but my word that is some first class gold-plated bat-shit insanity right there."" You remind me of a show I saw many years ago about monsters that live under someone's bed. This kid saw one coming out from under his bed, and the creature said ""I never harm the person whose bed I live under"".

""lso the Medieval Warm Period wasn't caused by low level clouds "" You seriously trying that tactic? No, the nwp was not caused by low level clouds, the little ice age was. Pictures painted during the mwp had high clouds. Pictures painted during the little ice age had low. C14 in co2 trapped in ice cores shows that during the wmp, cosmic radiation was low, but high during the little ice age, and low since. ""the warming was constrated at particular areas of the earth with other areals actaullt being cooler."" So it was only in Antarctica? Or was it only in Asia? Only in South America? Only in North America? Only in Africa? All of those locations show up both mwp and lia in their ice cores. Was it only in the South China Sea? Only in North Atlantic? Only in South Atlantic? Only in North Pacific? Only in South pacific? Only in Indian Ocean? All of those show both in their sea cores. Tree rings the world over show both of them, even the ones that michael Mann did. You just have to take into account that the tree rings show more than just temperature. They show climate. Temperature can be up but rainfall down or vice versa or many other factors and both will show little growth. Big rings shows EVERYTHING is good for growth. That's why the tree rings have shown that the climate is going down since the last 50 years. Not everything is right for them to have good tree rings.

It is a proven fact that it is warmer than it was hundreds of thousands of years ago, and even hotter then that it was millions of years ago. Thats the way stars do. As they age, they get hotter and bigger. ""Well actually solar irradiance is critical for the climate"" And your proof is? There isnt any. During the early part of the century, the irradiance was going up while the temperature went down. It continued to go up all the way to the 60, while the temperature first climbed then fell. Then it fell while the temperature went up. The alarmist claim that since during the 1910 to 1940, while the temperature was climbing and the irradiance went up, they have to be linked. It ignores the fact that the temperature fell from 1900 to 1910 and from 1940 to 1960 while the irradiance continued to climb. So when did they match? Proxies show the irradiance was high during the periods when the sunspots disappeared AND the temperature fell. So what does irradiance have to do with climate. No alarmist can say, other than the fact that for 30 years they both went up. ""The thing is that the warming that is being measured by sceitific instruments now can't be explained by solar irradience alone."" It never could. ""Cleaner technology you dishonst quarter wit.

During the little ice age, we didnt even have a single billion people. Now we have close to 8. That means even humans breath puts out 10 times as much co2 as we did before the industrial revolution began. Add our animals to feed that many people and you have easily 100 times the co2. Unless you want to force everyone to go vegetarian, and we do not have the farmland possible for that, we are going to have to put up with more co2 than we had before the industrial revolution. Of course we would not have them for long since every thing we are used to requires more co2 to make them. So we will have to do without ac during the summer or heating during the winter. Most of our medicine involves processes that produces co2. That means we have to stop using so many medicines.

If you knew the truth about I.Q. you would know that. To actually be smart, you have to have the capacity to learn (what I.Q. actually measures) and the knowledge to learn. A lot of people do not understand the difference, but it is there. Despite having a high I.Q. I have no phd's or masters or even bachelor degrees. Being smart means you have the knowledge. There are 6 year olds that have been tested to have high I.Q. but they do not have the learning to be considered smart. ""It would have been a simple thing for you to link to it."" Yes it would, but why should I do your work for you. You cant learn if I hand you the knowledge, esp. if it is knowledge you do not want.

Now that is quite a difference. Then you, John, go on: “What was left was was written by .3% of the scientist [that support AGW as the main cause of climate change]” Now there is a 0.3% figure in Cook’s abstract but its about those papers that are uncertain of AGW: “...and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming.” That leaves 32.6% of papers that mentioned AGW endorsing it as the main driver of climate change. Which if you look at Table 3 represents 34.8% of authors. In addition to this the authors of the papers surveyed were invited to rate their papers by the same criteria that Cook, et al, used. This is to remove any charges of bias that certain ‘non-special geniuses might throw. 14% responded. This is under 3.2 ‘Endorsement percentages of self-ratings’ and involved 2142 papers from 1189 authors. Now what happens here is that the percentage of those papers that endorse AGW rises to 62.7%. Those against AGW also rise to a towering 1.8%. So John, its not all bad news for your skeptics :) This is best seen in Table 5. So John ‘The problem is that only leaves 4%...’. You are either badly mistaken and a really terrible liar who assumes no-one will fact check your BS. And where does this (racism?)come from? Well John, you helpfully provide the answer right here: “...of the papers support agw, and that does not give Cook or others the power to demand people give up money to help other countries.” You don’t like foreign aid. I don’t think you have thought this through. Because unless we help the developing world adapt to these changes -and we in the industrial nations do out bit to cut emissions’ then we will see large migrations of people as seas inundate coastal regions and as changing climate patterns render farmland unusable. This will happen in the developed world as well. And you know who will benefit from this: Criminal gangs as they exploit the climate refugees and terrorists that will exploit the anger and power vacuum the mass displacements will create. You may think that you are far removed from the horrors of the world but your pig-headedness makes it all the more likely to end up at your front door. Deal with it. Wherever you are you are part of the world and your fortunes are interlinked with the rest of the world’s. John Hicks: “That is what this is all about. Cook and many others are liberals that believe that it the responsibility of everyone to see that everyone gets all they want. They want to take money away from Americans and other richer countries to bring poor countries up to a higher standard.” Ah now the tired old canard that science is just a liberal conspiracy. Anyone with a functioning brain can see this is BS. And why shouldn’t people in the third world enjoy a better standard of living? Nothing as unsustainable and energy hungry as we have in the West, but not having open sewers in the street or starving to death from famine. John Hicks “People are not willing to do so, so they concocted the bs report to convince people to support treaties intended to spread the wealth."" Don’t choke on your tinfoil hat, John. It would be such a loss to the world to lose a non-special genius like you’ Now this is just a survey. A snapshot of discussion on climate change discussion in the scientific community. And and what matters in any survey is the sample size. The larger the better as a small sample size can be easily weighted one way or another by random chance. If you throw a duice ten times and record the outcomes then you will likely have some numbers that don’t show whilst others will show up more than once. From that you might conclude the dice is weighted. Throw 100 times and the results should remove a lot of that bias. Throw 1000 times and it should be clear that the dice has a 1/6 chance of landing on each number. I’m sure a ‘not special genius’ like John can figure that out. Under section 4.1 ‘Sources of Uncertainty’ we can read: “We address the issue of representativeness by selecting the largest sample to date for this type of literature analysis. Nevertheless, 11 944 papers is only a fraction of the climate literature. A Web of Science search for 'climate change' over the same period yields 43 548 papers, while a search for 'climate' yields 128 440 papers.” If we take that higher figure then the 11,944 sample size represents about 9.3%. Which for a sample size is fantastic. Finally John. You know what made is so clear that your demented screed was so much BS This. This is what you wrote, John: “What was left was was written by .3% of the scientist.” This implies, or so you hope, that 99.7% climate scientists are either skeptical of or outright deny AGW. So the question is where the hell are they? I mean if the subject of climate science is being taken so far from the consensus of such a majority why do they not speak out? Who is attending the seminars. Who is peer-reviewing all those thousands of scientific papers. Where are all those papers from this 99.7%? Are they as lazy in action as you are in thinking John? I’m sure on the fullness of time you will come up with some batshittery that involves gub’munt conspiracy and FEMA camps. I’m certain it will be a laugh. And you. I will insult you. AGW is serious and will affect us all. The weight of evidence is against you and you’re hanging out with anti-vaxxers, creationists and flat-Earthers. These are your bedmates.

No-one is impressed by this hilariously obvious humblebrag. Anyone with any self-awareness would be ashamed if they wrote that. Now lets go unpick your maths: “I read the report that John Cook created and proclaimed that it was 97%. First off 66% were ignored because they had not stated an opinion. Then there was the 3% that disagreed with it being man made at all, leaving 31%. I do not remember the exact percentage right off hand, but 30% said that either man had done something but the amount was indeterminable, it was indeterminable that man had done anything, or that man had done something but it was small. What was left was was written by .3% of the scientist. The interesting things is they had written 4-5% of the total articles about the climate. Such a small number or writers, but they had written an amount that dwarf almost anyone else."" This is the report you refer to: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 It would have been a simple thing for you to link to it. You are the one making the claim, so it up to you to provide the evidence. But like the lazy little thinker you are I have to do the legwork for you. In the abstract of ‘Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature’ it says of the 11,944 peer-reviewed scientific papers written between 1991 to 2011: “We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.” Here we find the first example of innate your dishonesty, John. The 66.4% that you claim were ignored were not ignored. They had ‘no position’ for or against anthropogenic global warming (AGW). You incorrectly assume that the 66% must be against AGW. So you write them off. However under section 4 of Cook’s report under the heading ‘Discussion’ we can read: “Of note is the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW. This result is expected in consensus situations where scientists '...generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees'.” And it goes further: “This explanation is also consistent with a description of consensus as a 'spiral trajectory' in which 'initially intense contestation generates rapid settlement and induces a spiral of new questions'; the fundamental science of AGW is no longer controversial among the publishing science community and the remaining debate in the field has moved to other topics.” In short the 66% doesn’t mention AGW because in the scientific community (for which these papers were written) it is already accepted that AGW is real. There is no point in pointing out the glaciers are melting because of human release of CO2 in every single paper on melting glaciers because the people reading these papers already know that.",UCm3GjJmkQ0WnQU-716Hn9NQ,1,UgwZhOUJWryta6a6UK14AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

What really matters, is that I went to school before they began brainwashing children from baby hood to believe in agw. Every heard of a cartoon called ""Captain Planet and the Planetter""? It was a kids show from the 80's I believe, where they taught people that a) Americans are dumb and need to let the rest of the world lead, B) Big Oil is bad and things profits are more important than the future, and C) If we do not stop it, Global warming will wipe out the human race. Sound familiar? IF not, just read the IPCC reports. There have been dozens of kids shows that say the same thing in one manner or another. Kids in schools are not allowed to discuss the possibility that climate change is natural. My god son had to be home schooled because he refuse to accept the teachers instructions that he put on his paper that agw was a proven fact. IF they even think of saying that it is not America's fault, they get a bad grade. College student that try to claim that it is natural get beaten up, then they get kicked out of college for instigating the problem. It doesn't take long before people learn that they have to follow the leaders instruction or they have no future. No, I read the reports and there is not that many people that support agw. There is no way its even 50%. 66% do not support or deny it. So how do you get even 34% to 97% EVEN if all of them did support? You can not. What he did was have a team go through reports and say that they were NOT AGAINST man being the primary cause, and that was enough for them to be counted as support. ONE of the articles was a report on media bias for agw. It reported that 90%+ of news stories were on the damage being caused by global warming, YET it was counted as a scientific paper supporting agw. Another ""supporter"" was Dr Willie Soon. Every heard of him. He is very much a non supporter of agw, yet his papers arguing against agw were counted as support because it mentioned the 97% in its abstract. The paper was about how that number if fake. As to how you get a number less than 1%, here is how. The first report to mention the 97% number was a report written by a political science student. Yea, a student, who flunked his course for faking the report. What he did was send out 10000 questionnaires to scientist and got 3000 or so replies. Out of that he picked something like 90 people to send a follow up questionnaire. OF the responses, he threw several way and got 80 something responses he wanted. He reported that 97% of the 10000 supported agw and used the answers they 80 something gave him. 80 out of 10000 is not 97%, its .8%, .9 at maximum. YET his report was put in the first ipcc report, and he was credited as a tenured instructor and someone that had worked in the field for decades, longer in fact than he had been alive. When it was proven he wasnt, they scrubbed all references the report from all ipcc reports. Yet they still repeated the 97% without a report showing where the numbers came from. That is why cook and others used it, so that there would be a report that said that number.",UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g,1,UgwZhOUJWryta6a6UK14AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The problem is that only leaves 4% of the papers support agw, and that does not give Cook or others the power to demand people give up money to help other countries. That is what this is all about. Cook and many others are liberals that believe that it the responsibility of everyone to see that everyone gets all they want. They want to take money away from Americans and other richer countries to bring poor countries up to a higher standard.

Only about 3 to 4% of the papers supported agw, and almost all of them were written by the same people. 66% of the paper did not say if global warming was happening or not. OF the 34% that did say it was happening, the VAST majority said that there was evidence that man had CONTRITION SOMETHING to the warming, but either that evidence was not sufficient to be certain OR that the amount was small or uncertain. Only a small number of the 14000 papers actually supported agw. As I said, the paper was cooks own paper. ""The article says “*none* of the papers *disagreed* with the consensus position” of anthropogenic global warming. "" Just because they do not disagree does not mean they support. Look at the ones that Cook looked at. 66% did not say they disagreed, but they did not say they agreed. IF that is true then you could easily say that 66% of Naomi Oreskes 928 did not support and still get the statement she made. More over IF people people said that man was 1% responsible, they still would NOT DISAGREE with her statement.

Steel, stone, concrete and asphalt used in construction for buildings, roads, and other construction, retain heat from the sun’s energy during the day and dissipate that heat during the cooler hours. <br /><br />While attending the University of Arizona, during the early 1970’s, many “climatologists, meteorologists, scientists and other weather ‘experts’” were hysterically protesting and demonstrating (while professing) that we were entering another ICE-AGE. We obviously were not entering an ice-age then, and are not suffering “global warming” now.

Maybe we can seed a cloud here or there, but we can not stop or change the direction of a tornado or a hurricane or even a thunder storm or cold front or any other weather phenomenon.<br /><br />Fact 2: The air we breath (the Earth’s atmosphere) is made-up of about 77% Nitrogen, 22% Oxygen, and less than 1% argon. That leaves LESS than 1% of ALL OTHER GASSES and airborne materials (such as water vapor, dust, etc). Carbon Dioxide makes up less than 2/100’s of one percent of Earth’s atmosphere.

Cow flatulence are NOT Carbon Dioxide.

Two of them have been said by you which are increasing the viability of filtering CO2 out (as it still is in the baby steps, and cost/benefit may as well increase favorably the more technological advancement and research is done into it), and the increase in viability of alternate resources decreasing the footprint due to technological advancements of our current energy. <br /><br />There is also a third argument which is more of an economic argument tho. Between 60 and 70% of the current greenhouse emissions are done by the so called global south (WRI/CGDEV) which are countries that are still considered in developmental stage. There is one argument that regions need to go through an industrial revolution stage in order to become developed, and once developed they are capable of reducing their carbon footprint by decreasing their dependancy on energy sources that are unfavorable. So according to that reasoning, once other nations become more developed as well, they will decrease their greenhouse emissions as well naturally which will reduce the global emission drastically (without considering improvements in technology per se, just by developing their regions economically). <br /><br />It&#39;s quite an optimistic argument and goes to the &#39;humanity will figure it out&#39; reasoning, but thought it was worth mentioning as well.",UCFBbOM57-FhH6WilCTzVKjA,0,Ugyn-aMeVNdLtKZQpV54AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The best bet is simply quit subsidizing those things causing AGW. ((world wide, Fossil Fuels & connected industries TAKE 6.5% of GDP ..TRILLIONS in supports))) . In most cases the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized! A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible) It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock. We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies out compete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won’t work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that’s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. in·san·i·ty in'san?de/ noun the state of being seriously mentally ill; extreme foolishness or irrationality. We can reverse AGW though, and save money doing it. Here are three proposals. One made by me and two more similar ones. Here you can see how some might include a carbon market and ways we could do it without a carbon market. They are all workable. The main thing is that they are all stand alone solutions that have beneficial sides effects instead of detrimental side effects to the land and society. We should do them even if AGW wasn’t real. They would still be hugely beneficial all around. There is no negative down side. Win/win for all. Credit: Joel Pett | USA Today 1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming? Executive summary: Yes we can reverse Global Warming. It does not require huge tax increases or expensive untested risky technologies. It will require a three pronged approach worldwide. Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements. Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable. 2] Project Drawdown The list is comprised primarily of “no regrets” solutions—actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5] 3] Farming a climate change solution Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6] Footnotes [1] The $200 Billion Fossil Fuel Subsidy You've Never Heard Of (USA) [2] Fossil fuel subsidies are a staggering $5 tn per year | John Abraham [3] Fossil Fuel Subsidies Top $450 Billion Annually, Study Says (USA w various costs,supports) [4] Milking taxpayers [5] Solutions | Drawdown [6] http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF...",UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g,1,UgwKuI_JQr-ask0Gexh4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Scott Strough, Researcher in carbon farming as a climate change mitigation strategy ** ""There is no need to add additional taxes to combat climate change. The best bet is simply quit subsidizing those things causing AGW. ((world wide, Fossil Fuels & connected industries TAKE 6.5% of GDP ..TRILLIONS in supports))) . In most cases the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized! A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible) It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock. We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies out compete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won’t work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that’s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. in·san·i·ty in'san?de/ noun the state of being seriously mentally ill; extreme foolishness or irrationality. We can reverse AGW though, and save money doing it. Here are three proposals. One made by me and two more similar ones. Here you can see how some might include a carbon market and ways we could do it without a carbon market. They are all workable. The main thing is that they are all stand alone solutions that have beneficial sides effects instead of detrimental side effects to the land and society. We should do them even if AGW wasn’t real. They would still be hugely beneficial all around. There is no negative down side. Win/win for all. Credit: Joel Pett | USA Today 1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming? Executive summary: Yes we can reverse Global Warming. It does not require huge tax increases or expensive untested risky technologies. It will require a three pronged approach worldwide. Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements. Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable. 2] Project Drawdown The list is comprised primarily of “no regrets” solutions—actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5] 3] Farming a climate change solution Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6] Footnotes [1] The $200 Billion Fossil Fuel Subsidy You've Never Heard Of (USA) [2] Fossil fuel subsidies are a staggering $5 tn per year | John Abraham [3] Fossil Fuel Subsidies Top $450 Billion Annually, Study Says (USA w various costs,supports) [4] Milking taxpayers [5] Solutions | Drawdown [6] http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF...",UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g,1,UgwN8ptXeuBFzEvUtCR4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Also although evolution might be sped up by rapid climate change it is a very slow process and humans are also subject to it. In fact humans might have significantly changed as well by the time a significant number of new species will have appeared, all this to say it is not really relevant to ask the question in the sense of evolution.The species we will coexist with will nonetheless not be the same, but this will happen through another process. Species that already exist will become more prominent as others are plummeting in numbers, for example jellyfish are (for now) benefiting from climate change so they become more abundant, but they did not evolve for this they simply are already better fitted to the changes occuring. In the near future we can expect in some oceans to observe greater ratios of jellyfish to other species. Now is this to the benefit or detriment of humans ? In our example it seems that it is a problem as jellyfish are not commonly consumed by humans. But the impact of a greater population of jellyfish on the local environment is more difficult to estimate, it could destroy it as much as it could stabilize it, or have no effect (well I actually don't know if some research was done on this subject). In general in the near future it seems to be more of a nuisance, for example tiger mosquitos (able to transmit a lot of infections between humans) have started to appear in Europe, while bees (highly important to a lot of ecosystems) have been on the decline (well this is not just a consequence of climate change but also of the overuse of pesticides and the removal of nests), and vegetation vanishing will facilitate mud flows from floodings. These are few examples but overall it seems to be very bad. Your second question is much harder to answer, optimists will keep saying you to ""believe in our capacity of innovation"" but this would be blind faith. A recent study that has been quite widely shared estimates that past 2°C above pre-industrial levels we will enter runaway warming, which means that even if we no longer emit carbon dioxyde, temperature will keep rising to what is estimated as 3 to 4°C above pre-industrial levels. They added that they estimated our chances of being coordinated enough to avoid this to 5%, so without drastic changes in politics we should expect a +3-4°C scenario as most likely (in 2100) and with it the environmental catastrophes that it will bring. Will we survive as a species ? This depends on many other factors than temperature, for example if we keep on poisoning soils, making them infertile without proper fertilizer, we can expect it will be more difficult to keep on feeding everyone. We can already give estimations of how much climate change will cost in terms of damages and human lives, but total human extinction may happen in so many different scenarii that are are all so complex that giving an estimation of the probability of such events would be pure speculations. I hope I have given you some answers, I am sorry that this ended up so long but I really would hate to give you false understanding of something, hence the detours.

You see the current species and the planet system as a whole have evolved over millenia to be suited to the climate they experience, if that climate is to change then some species will evolve and other will go extinct but that is entirely normal. The issue with today's global warming is that it is incredibly fast and a lot of species may not be able to make it. Think of trees that reproduce very slowly and ""move"" (as a population) at a slow pace, and with them the whole ecosystems that they sustain are put at risk.

Well, no surprise that so many people choose to ignore the problem, sadly enough. If all climate change studies included a very clear statement of the obvious — we need to move to an economy based on 100% of nuclear power and we need to do that ASAP —, it would make the whole story much more credible and the environmental protection goals much more feasible, without the stupid anti-human idea of “changing our economy”. The latter is simply infeasible; if you consider 20 richest countries in the world as we know it, their economies are very similar in many ways and abundant energy is a cornerstone in all of them.

Are we due for an ice-age?&quot; A formal &quot;Ice Age&quot; is any time when there&#39;s a fixed ice sheet on Earth so Earth has been in a formal &quot;Ice Age&quot; for a few millions years and it is right now today. That&#39;s just semantics. You mean beginning of a glaciation period (colloquially an &quot;ice age&quot;). This is an excellent question because the answer is interesting as follows. The beginning of a glaciation period looks like the summers at high latitudes of northern hemisphere (65N is used by scientists) become too cool to melt all the snow/ice from the previous winter. This is important because you see the utter &quot;mini ice age&quot; drivel of the coal/oil shill fuckwits during northern hemisphere cold winter spells with a lot of snow. A cold winter or a lot of winter snow cannot ever trigger an &quot;ice age&quot; of any type so long as the following summer is warm enough to melt all the snow/ice. This is obvious. The snow cannot accumulate so there can be no glaciers growing. This is seen on mountain tops that have glaciers. They remain cool enough in summer so the snow/ice doesn&#39;t melt. Once summers become cool enough for this then the ice thickens year after year and the pressure at the middle starts pushing the edge south (ice flows). This is exactly what is happening now (and has been a few million years) on Antarctica &amp; Greenland but northern Asia (Russia &amp; other places) and northern North America at latitude 65N don&#39;t have cold enough summers for this to happen. The build up takes ~20,000 years or some such once the summers become cold enough, with the process accelerating because ice/snow reflect the Sun &quot;light&quot; a lot.",UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA,0,Ugzldmg94kchnyKRZLd4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Therein lies the problem: This is actually what we're trying to do. We are getting this interdependency, where to get where we want to get we would already have to know the outcome. This means that since we don't know everything about all the climate factors, everything we do is based on assumptions and this doesn't make for very good science. You are talking about data, yet data only shows us the whole picture (with the human factor). Data can not tell us how we are to interpret it, so any talk of ""without humans, the world would look like this"" is an educated guess at best. Compare this to quantum physics: First, you start with an observation in the macro spectrum that you don't really understand. You make the assumption it has to do with small particles, so you look for it in the quantum world. Once you find it, you develop a formula that predicts whatever you saw in the first place. This formula is then tested whether a) it can truly predict what you say it can, in every other situation, and b) whether it is compatible with the already established formulas. Now, apply that to climatology: You have the observation, and the assumption and the formula. But the rest is lacking, and this would be the most important part.",UCakv39B1fzQqgTH89E8Mz9w,1,UgwdG1hfMM5LDx2aYHl4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

This is more simple than predicting a century into the future and even more accurate because in this case, you already have all the data you need. For example, 20th century and onward has more data about individual forcings and climate conditions than any other time period. If your model can recreate those climate conditions (modern models are tested that way), then it's probably on the right track. for example https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0442%282004%29017%3C3721%3ACONAAF%3E2.0.CO%3B2",UC2u5kLHifDLAaFbhXPknroA,1,UgwdG1hfMM5LDx2aYHl4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Then, you need to take that same experiment into space to show that because there is nothing that has a strong enough gravitational pull, things won't fall down. So, if you want to show that climate change is anthropogenic, you need to show that climate is changing on our planet (which we have shown), and then you have to show that climate on earth without the human factor would change differently or not at all.

One area I&#39;ve been trying to understand more of is agriculture.<br /><br />In my time reading about it, I&#39;ve came across &quot;Restorative Grazing&quot;. I&#39;m probably going to butcher this, but what it claims is that grasslands have been grazed by hoofed animals (ungulates), especially ruminants, for millions of years. Since humans have came along though, we&#39;ve decimated wild populations of ruminant ungulates- like American bison and Wisents, for example. Now we have cattle and sheep to graze these lands instead.<br /><br />Now this is important, because grasslands can sequester carbon. This is helped by ungulates- they trample grass so it decomposes into the soil, and their wastes provide nutrients for the grasses to regrow. Some people who research this say that this method could sequester enough carbon to have a HUGE impact on carbon levels. <br /><br />If you haven&#39;t heard of this, and you want a better description, there&#39;s a TED talk by Alan Savory- he seems to be the founder of this. <br /><br />If you have, do you have an opinion on it? Do you think it will work? Have you heard other scientists talk about it working or being completely false? I&#39;m just looking for some guidance, as I everyone I ask is going to have an opinion, but you seemed like a person who would have an informed opinion- which is actually worth something to me. <br /><br />Also, to go back to the spread 10 different topics way, what&#39;s your opinion on nuclear energy? Energy is another topic I&#39;ve been trying to learn about, and it seems like nuclear is low carbon with massive amounts of energy. Should it be part of the solution for climate change, or are only renewables going to work for this?<br /><br />Thanks!",UCaUbBbut5GlmvFnjq7xIwFg,0,UgwviAab5PbHQHwrkkJ4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

I disagree on the causes, the severity and what should or shouldn't be done. There are also often gross inaccuracies in youtube videos made on climate change, this is what offends me most. Also, it bothers me that climate change theory (as presented in the media and on Youtube) is unfalsifiable or that people skew data. For example, whether it gets warmer or colder are both proof of global warming or how history matching data used in climate models are heavily massaged or how global temperatures are reported to a fraction of a degree where most thermometers used to collect the data are nowhere near that accurate. Also, most climate-alarmists push hard on their climate talking points but fail to even consider the amount of chaos their proposed changes would have on the global economy. The planet currently supports over 7 billion people. This is only possible with the aid of cheap-plentiful-carbon-based fuels. Several billion people would have to die in order to reduce the carbon footprint in a meaningful way. What I suggest instead is to: 1. Continue to burn fossil fuels until they are depleted (hopefully by this point we have enough technology to replace fossil fuels without a bunch of people starving to death) 2. If the climate changes, adapt. It is probably cheaper and will kill fewer people to adapt a strong economy to climate change rather than retooling our economy to be weaker (AKA greener). I didn't really go into depth about why I believe these two points but I will if you require. I believe doing these two are the two most ethical choices so long as you value human life as number 1 and the environment as number 2.",UC8esC0AWqR3WAJebhScnWtA,1,UgwBjOwAlEutd55JoTh4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

We know the methane hydrates are already coming out of the warmer shallow oceans and in the permafrost which is melting at an exponential rate. We know this will kill the oceans as it saturates in Co2 and shuts down the ocean circulation belts. If we lose the arctic we lose the planet as temps will rise quickly above 4C. We know we are in the 6th extinction event with only 1 being caused by impact and the others being climate change due to Co2.

There is lots of evidence that contradicts the position you hold. There is no consensus within the scientific community on the issue of climate change and global warming. It is well known that the temperature data has been manipulated to suit the political agenda that global warming is anthroprogenic. The mini ice age in the late medieval period lasted for about 150 years or so. This means temperatures were higher with low CO2 levels prior to onset of the ice age and post. In the mid 1970s scientist at the time were predicting global cooling because the preceding 15 years or so the world experienced a drop in average temperatures.

However, if you look at the global temerature overtime from before the ice age, you'll see that it goes a lot higher than before the ice age. Why would an ice age cause tempertures to go much higher than before, and in such a short amount of time? Ever heard of an 'anomly'? If one part of a data is out, that does not mean there's no correlation. It means either it was random or it's a weak correlation, but still a correlation. Anyways, we can say for certain that, at least since 1970, there is a positive correlation between the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and the global average temperature. If you're disputing that, then you don't know how graphs work. This isn't to do with language. Do you think that people set up a model to track something far into the future and used the word 'weather' to refer to it over a short time? No. Let's not argue with language because it'll get us nowhere. They meant to track them into the future, why would they use something that doesn't work into the future? Actually, what I said wasn't ad hominem. I didn't attack anything about your character. I was referring to 'cognative dissonanse', which I hoped would be explained by the last sentence in brackets. But, basically, when people find evidence that contradicts what they already belive, it causes a fight or flight response.

No one can say, not even you, how water vapour concentration has varied over time. However water vapour has greater global warming potential and it is known that the atmosphere holds between 3% and 5% water vapour. Land mass with heavy cloud cover is much warmer than land mass with a clear sky. So what that CO2 levels have risen to about 410 ppm.

I also said that the apparent rise in average surface temperature since the start of the industrial revolution is referenced against a lower average temperature when the earth was going through a mini ice age. There is no correlation between CO2 concentration and global temperature. In the period between 1950 and 1975 the average temperature was decrteasing whilst CO2 levels still continued to rise. Examiniation of geological records has provided evidence of periods when the CO2 levels were high (around 3000 ppm) with corresponding low average temperatures and vice versa. The models used to predict climate change outcomes are based on one ones used to predict weather. Weather referes to atmopheric condition over a short time whereas climate is looking at atmospheric conditions over a long period.

No, however CO2 has. The excess gives rise to new problems, not the natural abundance. - Plate tectonics indeed do explain rise in sea-levels, but only over millions of years. The effect seen in 200 years can thus not be explained by plate tectonics. - There is a big difference between weather models and climate models. Weather is indeed very hard to predict over a long period of time (due to chaos), however climate is interested in the longer term effects such as yearly oscillation swings (due to summer and winter) and seasonal effects. We know these models work well since we used these on data from a long time ago and if we stop them at our current data they give the correct conclusions. This is the first test that is done to check if the model work. After many more tests we can eventually use the model if all tests were successful. That is why computer models are useful. - We can measure the effects of CO2 on the heat-trapping in the laboratory and clearly see these effects. Also even if there were times were the C02 concentration was lower and the temperature higher this still is no argument against the trapping of heat by C02, it just shows that there is more than one factor involved. Now over the last 200 years we have seen little change in all other known factors, however the C02 concentration has doubled. Lastly I would like to emphasize again that it is al about the time intervals. The big problem is not the rise nor the net increase in temperature. It is the fact that this all is happening in a very small time window of +- 200 years.",UCOji5CnXZQjs86d977vf2qg,1,Ugz1-e6fBy2AGBx2Vqp4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Does that mean it can't increase? It's not a secret, scientists changed the name because it describes it better (ie not hot all the time, just an increase in extreme occurances). Fun fact: the atmosphere can hold more water vapour as it gets hotter, meaning that CO2 can kickstart a feedback loop that's difficult to get out of. Why does it match up with the industrial era then? Why hasn't it been steadily rising for the few billion years as life was evolving? Weather newscasts need to predict very specific types in very specific locations. These predictions are over the whole earth and are detecting raw statistics like heat and velocity. Saying 'Bah, we can't trust these' is just an easy way to deny them. And what do you mean they've proven false? Can you provide a source? Otherwise there's no reason for anyone to belive you (unless they're experiencing cognative dissonanese and are just trying to find anything that supports their view so they don't have to change their mind). No it's not. You're in denial because you had a certain view and then you saw conflicing evidence and were too weak to admit there's a chance you're wrong.",UCbq9Rl8vNh-5qOD_EZo7QqA,1,Ugz1-e6fBy2AGBx2Vqp4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

It's one of the main limiting factors in plant growth, the other being nitrogen and water which indirectly also benefit from increased levels of Co2. Nitrogen due to the symbiotic relationship between plants and nitrogen fixating bacteria, more plants also mean more of those bacteria, and water due to the increased water use efficiency, less water needed for the same growth due to plants being able to close their carbon intaking, but also water losing mouths longer. The current heat wave is an anomaly, I hear the alarmists mocking sceptics for pointing out to a cold winter and go like oh see there's no global warming. This is the same except reverse, talk about the long term trends please. Alarmists and pointing to droughts go hand in hand even if there's an increase in rainfall when the weather is warmer, droughts have been DECREASING in the 20th century. If the dust bowl happened now the media would be all over it how it would be evidence for global warming and a worsening climate. And when talking about the long term trends I have no convidence in the IPCC ever being right due to how wrong they have been in the past and just assuming there's a massive positive feedback loop between the warming effect of Co2 and other factors. They assume there's a net positive feedback loop although logically there'd be a net negative feedback due to the climate not having gone crazy in the past.

Funnily enough, you can't just ""look it up"" and understand it Barry the Baker; it takes years worth of understanding in atmospheric physics and chemistry etc. Who should we believe? The above 85% consenus by climatologists or some dumb fuck who has a Google Degree and worked out CO2 is ""plant food"". @Crystal Giddens I'm hazarding a guess that you are not a scientist - correct me if I'm wrong. Please have some very basic understanding of CO2 fixation in LIR before even approaching the complexity of climate science. If you don't understand pre-university photosynthesis it really casts doubt on your ability to understand free-radical substitution, ODS mechanisms and radiative forcing etc. If it's 5th grade you should be aware that stomatal closure occurs among plants when exposed to an excess of CO2 to reduce water vapour loss right? ;) No one is denying the sun is responsible for heating. It's simply accepted and considered within this argument; the Melankovitch cycle is already well documented and so have the impacts of sunspots - mathematically we tend to treat solar input as a constant (Gsc) due to the huge amount of data we can access/are currently monitoring. That is why solar forcing may not be seen explicitly accounted for within an abstract; solar variance is marginal and at most Gsc would be minorly manipulated depending upon the circumstances of a specific study. That is why we assess the impact of other variables against the fact we know solar variance is minimal/predominantly constant; the basic assumption being if solar input doesn't change but global temperatures increase there must be other factors responsible. Your tripe about the albedo effect is also fairly irrelevant - by your logic we would already be experiencing a global average of negative radiative forcing due to cloud reflection and our increased global temperatures. However, clouds do not have total global coverage! Even if that was to be the case, not all clouds exact the same strength of albedo effect; the action of albedo by some clouds is miniscule (0) to (for e.g. as with some stratocumulus) up to 0.8. It is also fairly impossible to assume a constant value for average cloud albedo considering we cannot predict the exact composition of cloud type globally to the same degree of accuracy as Gsc for example, especially as many factors (droplet size etc) effect albedo strength. You also seem to fail to understand that additional greenhouse warming has an accessory effect to ""natural warming""; no one is claming CO2 is purely responsible for warming, however it's coalesence in the upper troposphere and translation of KE to other gaseous molecules in the troposphere is scientifically accepted, and responsible for tropospheric warming. It also addresses your mistake in being unable to separate the distinction between tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. For example KE translation in the stratosphere will result in cooling from the deexcitation of CO2 that has absorbed IR. But the important point is that the most relevant (to heating) CO2 coalesces in the upper troposphere; the same KE translation mechanism doesn't occur - instead emitted radiation is absorbed by closer, and warmer CO2 at a higher pressure and that heat is trapped. This occurs ever more likely at higher tropospheric CO2 quantities, in simple terms in accordance to Kinetic Theory (admittedly, it is more complicated than that). CO2's physical properties exact warming and cooling at different atmospheric levels; a simple fact you should be aware of. Your statement about atmopheric escape in relation to CO2 is also irrelevant. CO2 does not ""leave the atmosphere"" it is too heavy to undergo Jean's escape, and due to a lot of complicated processes I don't have the time to explain CO2 is typically sequestered. But that does not mean CO2 levels are not a concern as sequestering CAN happen; it's a concern because we are releasing atmopheric CO2 at a much greater rate than is naturally or artificially (carbon capture etc.) sequestered. That is a statistical fact due to the increased concentrations of CO2 recorded. And this is just ONE factor that can impact global flucutation. I'm not even taking into account the different mechanisms for different greenhouse gases and the implications of o-zone depletion or the effects upon weathering patterns and their consequences ""Pure science"" you will find from the consensus of 12,000 climatology journals from peer-reviewed publishers, and from individuals like Dr. Simon Clarke who possess specialist knowledge of the subject.

In order to convince people that sceptics are not smart enough they lie and say stupid things like this.The reality is we know we are changing the world, just we are using science to look at the reality of it. Dams are changing rushing river into lakes and stopping floods. Most of the time this is good, but there are times when it isnt. Take for instance river deltas. When you stop flooding, you stop the river from putting new material on top of old. The result is that the mud below gradually gets squeezed out causing the land to subside. The result is that cities built on these are getting flooded by the sea. Agriculture is turning deserts into farm land. This changes the climate around them. Building cities causes heat islands and the micro climates that spring up around them as a result. This changes the climate as a whole as well. Building roads also changes the climate. Building islands changes the ocean currents. This in change changes the atmospheric currents. We have changed the environment in multiple ways, BUT there is no evidence that we have altered the global temperature much. The evidence says that the atmospheric sensitivity to changes in co2 is actually pretty low, if not zero. All the alarms require it to be something like 4°C per doubling of co2, but all the models that use that, are off by almost half a degree in 17 years. A model based on the absorption of energy by water melted from glaciers is off by .1°C in 70 years. That model totally ignored co2, saying that the atmospheric sensitivity was zero. No, it is not the ones you call deniers that deny science, but alarmist.",UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g,1,UgwdBi9WTOHbwXqhu814AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Yes greenhouse gases trap heat. Yes man's emissions add co2 to the atmosphere. No, that is not warming the planet. Let's start with the basics. The SUN warms the planet NOT co2. You must grasp the concept to continue. At night, unless a warm front moves in, it will ALWAYS cool down because the sun is NOT shining. It really is that simple. Since you are being simple minded please keep that in mind as I continue. The sun warms the planet NOT co2. The earth's climate is predominantly homeostatic in that positive and negative feedback loops keep the earth's temperature in balance. I will discuss two of these positive and negative feedback loops below to explain how they help keep the earth's temperature in balance but first know this too. According to NOAA (not my figures, theirs) the earth has warmed 0.7 - 0.9 degrees since coming out of the last glacial period 1901 to present. Considering we were in a glacial period and we are not in one now that is pretty damn stable if you ask me. Right? Less than 1 degree change is stable in anybodies book! *The two positive and negative feedback loops I will discuss are the carbon cycle and albedo.* *The carbon cycle:* The oceans, lakes, rivers streams, etc are by far the largest carbon sinks on earth. Carbon sinks store co2. i.e. they trap co2 from the atmosphere. As it warms (due to the solubility of gases in water) these bodies of water release more of their co2 into the atmosphere aka gasing. notice, the warming comes first, then the gasing occurs. Is it any wonder that it is warmer and there is more co2 in the atmosphere? No! Warming causes gasing. The co2 levels in the atmosphere must always increase as we warm. *Albedo:* Albedo is the property of reflecting sunlight back into space. It is the opposite of a greenhouse gas. It prevents heat from reaching the earth from the sun. Clouds have by far the greatest albedo effect on the earth. They reflect sunlight before it can reach earth and warm it and be trapped by greenhouse gases. Got it? Now, as it waRMS AN INTERESTING NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP KICKS IN. As the earth warms more water evaporates resulting in more moisture in the air. This moister forms clouds. Warming leads to cloud formations. The warmer it is the more clouds there are due to the evaporation of water. As these clouds form more sunlight is blocked and viola! The earth begins to cool. Less sunlight means cooler weather just as night is cooler than day. Another interesting feedback loop kicks in. More clouds and rain means more co2 is washed out of the atmosphere (aka weathering). And since the earth is cooler more of that co2 will remain ""trapped"" aka stored in the oceans rivers lakes streams ponds etc. Viola! Less co2 means less heat id trapped and cooling continues on and on BUT these feedback loops are so effective it means overall temperature variations over the period in excess of a hundred years is a mere 0.7 to 0.9 degrees even though we are coming out of an ice age! That is freaking stable! You see? The SUN drives the climate NOT co2! There is more but if you cannot grasp this you are hopeless. Man additions of co2 have only served to green the earth. Greening has occurred in the amount of the continental united states in the past 50 years or so. Plants are also co2 store houses that scrub co2 from the atmosphere. This all used to be 5th grade science. they are LYING to you! co2 is plant fucking food! The earth's climate is extremely stable and can handle periods of volcanic activity with no problem. You people are being duped! get out of your information ghetto and look at real science. They are LIARS! They want your money and they want control of the earth. This shit is purely political.

The methane and other compounds with hydrogen bonds are a problem in this way too. A slow increase is probably fine but a sudden flood over a few decades instead of thousands of years and these systems fail. The oceans get too warm and begin to releases gas instead of absorbing it.

That's why you see when Bill Nye conducts his own ""experiment"" to the world. he uses a relatively small glass jar and pumps a pressurized tank full of CO2. He's dumping straight CO2 in another can, and I don't know if you know but our Earth has nothing in common with a glass jar. We have Water, Trees, A large atmosphere that expands close to space. We have things that absorb CO2 both on land and in the ocean. And if you know a bit of chemistry the CO2 turns into other chemicals as its interacting with the air. ""My god, do you think if the planet would be warming we wouldn't have cold local winters?"" -- There would be a relatively small amount of snow fall. That would be a great sign that CO2 is causing global warming. Because by their standards the atmosphere is getting more and more rich with CO2 which means more and more heat retention.

You can graph it and see if every year temperatures are rising OVER ALL, and keep rising. Hence we should be having less and less snow fall.

Let alone Biological Chemistry. Like you and the rest of society who think that Math is hard would pay their attention and believe everything that Bill Nye says because hes popular. Sorry but popularity doesn't equal intelligence, you can watch Katy Perry and Neil de Grasse for reference. Oh but a person who is an actual weather scientist like Tim Ball a PhD in Weather Science, or Physicists who have careers in science and not mechanics like William Happer or Ivar Giaever a Nobel Laureate who are independent of government funded programs like NASA. When they speak out at how wrong NASA and Bill Nye are, no one wants to listen to them. I'm not stupid enough to trust people who are for the FAME AND FORTUNE to give me the FACTS. I trust those that don't go after that AGENDA and instead are devoted to actual Science. BTW Ive studied general chemistry and a little on Biological chemistry. And I'm in the process of getting an Engineering Degree. So I know enough to smell bull shit by people who were bought and paid for. ""Please, just because you've heard about spacex more in the news doesn't mean they are more successful."" -- Actually if you did any research at all or read the news like an adult, you would learn that SpaceX is the main company who is delivering goods to the Space Stations that orbit the Earth. Not only that, they developed rockets that can be reused. And your talking about a company that was recently born. And NASA has trouble sending a small robot to other planets.

BUT GUESS WHAT. That's not the case. Further more, they can absorb 3x the CO2 content from the Atmosphere. Which means we don't even have enough CO2 in the air to cause an over abundance. Which debunks the hysteria of CO2 ""doomsday green house gas"" Better yet, master minds who started this made more harmful objects than ""green"" you have cars that run on battery acid. You know that battery acid destroys the soil and is super toxic right??? Yea not very green.. OH how about Manufacturing stupid fan like wind turbines which cause electricity bills to sky rocket because its 56$/ KWH vs 0.05/KWH on a nuclear power plant. That's great we have to pay more. Also note these stupid over grown fans need maintenance all the time, which its called inefficient and the manufacturing to produce them produces more toxic gasses, again not very green.

[...] The APS study and a subsequent paper assumed use of hundreds of vertically oriented counterflow packed towers using a design common to post-combustion CCS. This design requires 190 kWhr/t-CO2 of energy and has a capital intensity of $1,304 $/t-CO2-year.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />(Prospects for technology development and cost reduction)<br />It is difficult to estimate the cost of a technology prior to its widespread deployment. CE has spent several tens of millions of dollars developing DAC technology, <b>yet our performance and cost estimates still carry substantial uncertainty.</b> [...] <b>The process described here should therefore be seen as a low-risk starting point rather than a fully optimized least-cost design.</b><br />Many small process changes will incrementally improve performance relative to the baseline described here.”<br /><br />PART 2, don’t you think that THAT’s the cost for A PROTOTYPE operating ? We’re humans, we can build a lot more than that and a lot better than what they’ve theoretically imagined, expected and estimated.<br /><br />Again, that’s an estimate, we still don’t know the real cost, and innovation’ll make nothing else than lower that cost.",UCDCxoOJ0Y8rslWUHreeWP4A,0,Ugx4Eo-Yqj4JEC0wuo94AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

I have cut back my consumption and rarely eat meat as a rare treat, but I do feel guilty; Cus i know what im doing, but it makes me feel good. And can i blame everyone else for doing it then ? Judging by the silence, the problems are too much for politcians and media to handle, because changing peoples habbits is never going to be popular. And popularity is good for our capitalist world. <br /><br />My thoughts to changing the world would be the education; Instead of only just pumping out worker bees, the education systems should start educating people to be humans and to build a world with trust; teach to do what makes you happy, but be mindful of the world and take responsiblity for living. . Trust these humans to use their skills as they enjoy, and that they can and will be good at it too to better the world. I would implement Universal basic income and push for the automation of jobs, so people can spend their time living instead of working.",UCvQ1xIJXLYSCxv5AmG1LTDA,0,UgybC5GS0nlSvOpVo9t4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

I find the fact that we could spend 3 trillion a year to REDUCE CATASTROPHIC climate change to be very good. I fully think we are going to reach 100% renewable energy system on the economics alone. we should not be screaming about negative emissions from the mountain top, but we should selectively to people who are depressed about climate change. A small portion of the population is very depressed about climate change. If we could better mobilize these people to do a few simple things then we could really accelerate stopping our emissions. Not eating meat is right on. it feels like a small difference but its not. Even if you only cut out meat a few meals a weeks and occasionally buy meat substitutes that is making a huge difference because you are helping to bring down the cost of meat substitutes. the price of meat substitutes is falling fast and their quality is improving. Eventually they will taste very similar to meat and be substantially cheaper. so you cannot just think about the emissions that you directly reduce by eathing less meat. your purchases now, will help make a future where meat substitutes and lab grown meat are actually mainstream primarily based on cost. The same is true with EVs. There are 2 billion cars on the road and only 4 million are EVs. seems sad, but no it is not. Those 4 million EVs being sold has helped the cost of batteries fall tremendously. buying a EV, especially a Tesla is probably the best thing you can do for the environment. Tesla plans for the future are completely different than what most people think. They aim to make an self-driving electric car that can last for 1 million miles. an average person would take a lifetime to drive a million miles, but not a self-driving taxi. a self-driving taxi systems could reduce the number of cars we need by a factor 7-15. so for example, instead of needing to making 15 million news cars a year. we might only have to make 1-2 millions if we all gave up owning a car. we could also saves thousands of dollars every year. as we buy EVs are also lowering the cost of batteries, which is the last piece of the puzzle for getting to 100% renewable energy. so if you decide to buy an EV now you are helping to fund that sustainable future. do not think about the direct emissions you prevent. Think about how you are helping to make the technology cheaper. trust me I am a writer for cleantechnica, and I have watched the prices of wind, solar, batteries, and EVs fall consistently year after year. early adopters are making a massive differnce. all these technologies still have a lot of room for improvement and cost declines. do not let trump get you down. The problem is still solvable and whatever little bit you can do is helpful. decades from now we will probably begin negative emissions operations. The money will not matter when we see our cities start to flood more regularly. we will prevent civilization from collapsing. Ten year ago, I would have thought human civilization as we know it was done for, but I have seen the cost of solar decline by 80% in the last decade. Batteries have declined even further from that. one other great opportunity you will have soon is to invest in green bonds. most green bonds are being sold to large investors but they are starting to sell them in 1,000 increments. you earn a few percent and you help fund renwable energy.

Reason being a majority of the warming trend has to do with higher than normal amounts of solar radiation hitting the ocean creating more cloud cover trapping more heat and causing the ocean to release more co2. The Earth&#39;s core is all outta whack and the protective shell around the earth isn&#39;t working as it should. Not too long ago people were seeing Aurora Borealis as far south as the Ozark here in the US which is in northern frickin Arkansas which is crazy in and of itself. Churning in the earth&#39;s liquid outer core results in the dynamo that generates and maintains the the earth&#39;s magnetic field which helps protect us from harmful solar wind - when that protective shielding gets upset it can&#39;t block out as much of that radiation which is causing the oceans to rise in temperature. The core has been sloshing about at an unstable rate resulting in more volcanic eruptions, earthquakes of greater magnitude and frequency and a measurable change in geyser activity (not to mention some of the other weird shit like buckling roads, 65-70 foot deep chasms opening up in numerous areas in the world over night in some places.) Yeah, so your main culprit for all this is right under your feet. The more research you do, the more it will become obvious - it seems completely disingenuous to give false hope that humanity can solve this issue that it&#39;s not even fully responsible for to begin with. That said, we should still cut back on fossil fuels and work at using renewable energy finding a way to harness the power from these more powerful storms might be a really good way to start cause they&#39;re only going to get worse no matter what humanity does.

Why are many temperature sensors located in heat islands, exaggerating any kind of heat increases you claim might have happened?<br />4. Why has the ice increased so much on Antarctica and in the Arctic? Follow up question, Al Gore said by now the oceans would have risen 100 feet. Why haven&#39;t they?<br />5. Why is it snowing in South Africa for the first time in 150 years?<br />6. Why do the patterns of flood, drought and cold resemble weather patterns from the last Ice Age?<br />7.

Because that's where the people are. And these biases are accounted for in global averages using surface observations. 4. Ice has substantially melted in the Arctic summer on summer. The interior of the east Antarctic has seen some localised ice gain, but the net change is negative. 5. For the same reason that the UK had an extremely cold winter this year - changes in global temperature and precipitation patterns due to increased energy in the atmosphere. 6. I've never seen this in the literature, but it likely is due to boundary conditions (i.e. uniform radiative forcing on a spherical domain) 7. When peer-reviewed science supports this. So no time soon, as consensus is overwhelming. 8. Natural volcanism and ecological processes over millions of years. The current quantity of CO2 isn't alarming, it's unprecedented rate of change that is. 9. Tropical storm frequency in the north Atlantic has increased from approximately 11 to 16 per year. 10. This is a lie. Polar bear numbers are decreasing in 17 of 19 distinct populations in the Arctic, with a definite net global negative. 11. Icebreakers are useful in an environment where there is ice and open water, not just ice alone. An increase in icebreakers represents a clearing of the Arctic in summer. Questions answered.

BUTT since only a very small percentage is willing to do that the meat industry will stay the same way as it is now. <br />Public transport is already a mess in most places and often an impertinence to the customer. Especially during rush hour. (a few exceptions exist). <br />There would have to be massive changes in society and infrastructure but seeing how most people (even those with supposedly higher education) don&#39;t give two fucks about the energy they are wasting or the waste they are producing or where it will end up after they thoughtlessly through it away I don&#39;t see any change coming. <br />Overall it&#39;s just more convenient (and more importantly) economically more feasible to go for the cheap, dirty factory meat then to go to the butcher. A lot of people simply can&#39;t afford quality (and organic) products and thus have to go for this option and this trend is going to worsen. <br />The inability (or unwillingness) of companies and governments alike to restrict their emissions and produce in a more sustainable way is another nail in the coffin. Everyone knows about the problems of climate change, waste etc. etc. but very few people with very limited capabilites are actually trying to do sth. The major players just don&#39;t move. The companies want to protect their revenues, nations want to protect their economical power and the average citizen doesn&#39;t give a fuck where his BigMac came from or under which conditions the cow grew up or how many different cow-carcasses are mangled up in this single patty nor does he care where the packaging end up after he threw it away or how much Co2 was produced in the whole process. <br /><br />I really would like to be an optimist about that whole thing, that mankind will live sustainable at some point, but my everyday experience and recent political developments are speaking a clear language: Life as we know it is fucked. <br />When I was talking to my parents about those issues they replied: Noone else does it, why should we make it harder for ourselves? Why should we miss out on the fun things of life? Why should we pay triple the price for organic food then we would pay for conventional produce? <br />And you know what? they are right imo. Very few people care, nothing will change, so why should i burden myself with it? I had it. You might say that way of thinking is the whole problem. I tried to live &quot;more sustainable&quot; but all those little things that probably most people do just drove me insane. The consumerism, leaving windows half open in winter while the heating is on full power (and then leaving the house for the whole day), the complete disregard how much garbage people are producing and often open disregard for the direct surroundings (just throwing shit out in the open like cigarette butts, packaging etc.) The People won&#39;t change. <br /><br />Well.

I am hopeful knowing that you have at least admitted to the pause and the fact that you have identified the fact that the el Nino cycle drove up temperatures in the 90's (the AGW explanation for the cause of the pause).

Climate change is a cyclical process and just because there appears to be a correlation between two factors does not mean that correlation is causation. Yes the globe warmed up in the 20th century, it did the same during the Medieval warm period, but in either case it had nothing to do with increasing atmospheric CO2 and everything to do with solar cycles. <br /><br />To put it into perspective, one out of every 2500 atoms in our atmosphere is CO2 and out of those 1/2500 atoms, humans produced 1-4 out of hundred(1-4/100), so human produced CO2 on a global scale is insignificant and to suggest it is causing unprecedented warming is absurd. Water vapour is responsible for the vast majority of the greenhouse effect.<br />Following the Medieval Warm Period came a grand solar minimum aka, the dark ages, at the same time there was a massive cooling that took place in Europe that caused 30% loss of life to starvation due to crop loss and then another 30% loss of life to disease. This is the real threat facing humanity and we can see it in world wide local news reports of crop losses everywhere due to freezing temps, flooding and hail.

First off, I am not a ""climate change skeptic"", I fully appreciate climate change as a part of the cyclical nature of this planet. If I am skeptical of anything it is the anthropogenic global warming narrative among others coming from the UN. Mixing the two is being disingenuous. The proof is in the historical record as well as the fact all the predictions based on these models that use CO2 as climate driver have failed miserably. Historically, CO2 has at times been much higher than now though temperatures were not. Also, if one looks at the historical record one can see a cyclical 1000+/- year cycle of extreme warming followed by extreme cooling. Roman warm period, Medieval warm period, modern warm period(20th century). Before we ignore the cyclical patterns there needs to be some proof beyond hyperbolic propaganda that claims a correlation between two events - increased warming of the Modern Warm Period and human produced CO2. Correlation is not causation and these two things have not been proven to have a causal relationship. Ozone is not CO2 and as such using it as an analogy does not really prove anything. You need to prove that small insignificant amounts of CO2 can produce such temperature changes, something which no-one has done to date. ""There is a difference between greenhouse effect and changing that effect."" ~ What is the difference? You claim there is a difference but do not define what that difference is. And until you prove that small insignificant amounts of CO2 can do what you claim your point here is meaningless. And what causes an atmosphere to warm? Answer is pressure. Compress a gas and it will warm. Certainly the sun has some input in this as well, but not as much as the standard theory believes. It should also be noted that as sea temp increases the oceans release CO2 and when they cool they absorb CO2. The oceans are the regulator of atmospheric CO2 and contain 50 times more than the atmosphere. The dark age refers to the latter medieval age post the grand solar minimum and has nought to do with the warm medieval period when populations increased due to an abundance of food. And the reason it was the dark ages was due to the constant cloud cover coupled with high levels of ash and particulate(both of these effects were caused by an increase in cosmic rays something that is occurring now) in the atmosphere and not due to the lack of enlightenment. if you read historical texts from this period, priests, doctors and other educated persons write about how dark it always was, though they did not understand the cause. I did not manipulate the numbers as you just did. I said gl0bal mean temp(GMT) was down 0.56*C over TWO years not one. And as for the alleged warming, one cannot ascertain whether that is true considering they input numbers for large areas that have no temperature monitors. As well a recent paper discussed that all the various data sets for temperature do not correlate as they once did largely due to data manipulation. What I am observing in local news reports around the world is longer colder winters. England alleges last winter there took 48000 lives. Arctic and Antarctic Ice is up which shows a reverse of a trend and time will tell if it is. And of course during a warming period that is a part of a natural cycle ice will melt, but that warming period is over, temperatures paused for a few years and are now on the downswing, ergo 6000+ cold temperature records being broken in the past TWO years. A recent paper published spoke too of how it is likely volcanoes below the ice causing melting in Antarctica and not atmospheric temperature. More importantly, what about the lies by mainstream media who claim things such as this past February when they allege the Arctic is melting away as temperatures rose 45*C in a day and using words like ""tropical"" to describe the effect. I checked the satellite temperature for the Arctic and yes it rose 45*C, it went from -52*C to -7*C which is hardly warm enough to melt ice nor be thought of as tropical. It is this constant lying to support the AGW narrative that should wake people up to the fact that if that narrative were true they would not have to lie about it. Not only lyng but bullying as well. There have been a number of climatologists that have stepped forth to say that their jobs were threatened if they did not jump on board the global warming shiip. Dr Judith Curry, once a lead author for the IPCC now speaks out vociferously regarding the weak and questionable science of global warming. Dr Tim Ball is a paleoclimatologist and he too is defending himself from a lawsuit for speaking out against the global warming narrative. I am sure you know of the ""hockey stick chart"" by Dr Phil Jones, who, when asked for the raw data refused on the premise that he had been working for many years on this and did not want someone else to come along and destroy it. Well, if his results were true he shouldn't fear someone destroying his work. The success of science is built upon reproducibility. If other scientists cannot reproduce your work it comes into question, if they can reproduce your results, you become known for that discovery. The fact that Phil Jones refused to share his data is suggestive that his results were dishonestly achieved and when you add into the fact, climategate, the release of their emails showing they did manipulate data for which he was found by the Uk Information Commissioner to be guilty of crimes but due to a technocality(time restriction) he could not be charged really makes that graph highly suspicious and easily dismissed. Yes Gore makes $50,000,000.00/yr selling carbon credits. What do you expect from these elitist capitalists? Do you really think he cares about you or me? I find the gullibility and naivety of the masses towards these self-serving capitalistic wealth hoarders remarkable. The AGW narrative is means by the UN(which has always sought its own source of funding) to convince governments to tax every aspect of your life. And if I am correct about the potential for a mini ice age with longer harsher winters, then people will need to burn more carbon just to keep warm to survive the winters. As for your last comment, I am not sure what you are trying to say. Would you please clarify? If you ignore the scientific claims and just look analytically at how AGW is being played out it lacks truth. Truth does not require hyperbolic propaganda nor does it require lies, bullying or shaming. Did you know that many planets within the solar system are also experiencing climate change? If all the planets are going through climatic changes then it logically suggests that there is one source for these changes ~ the sun.

So low concentrations have no effect? What about ozone which is about 0.000007% of the atmosphere and yet it protects life from harmful solar radiation. I have never seen climate change ""skeptic"" talk about that. There is a difference between greenhouse effect and changing that effect. Water vapor is a condensable greenhouse gas. You can't pump more of it into the atmopshere, it will come raining down. You must increase the temperature first. So water can't be the reason for the change. Unlike water vapor, CO2 concentration isn't bound by the temperature, which makes it the biggest greenhouse gas which can be meddled with. The dark age refers to the medieval age. Mainstream media doesn't say anything because the world isn't cooling and 30% of the European population died during the black death which happened 3-4 centuries before the effects of Little Ice Age were noticable. And the change between february of 2016 and feb of 2017 was about 0.2-0.3 degrees down. And yet the yearly average was down by 0.09 showing how you can manipulate statistics to support your own opinion. You can't draw a straight line from 2 points on the graph, it's not how it works. You talk how a straight line was drawn between temperatures of february of 2016, which was the highest ever recorded month, and february 2018. Not only did you manipulate statistics, you also took 2 years... 2 years against a warming trend starting from the 70s. The Arctic ice is up for 1 year... against 3 decade down trend?

Air capture will not need to come down in cost by three orders of magnitude, or even two. 1/100 of the estimate in the paper would be really cheap--$30 billion/yr is a really small part of global energy spending, which I think is around $8 trillion/yr.<br /><br />Nuclear waste decay, and CO2 uptake by geological processes, do not compare well. Nuclear waste has a sharp drop, with a very long, low tail; that&#39;s much less true for CO2. IMO it&#39;d be better to not even make the comparison, but find something else.<br /><br />Also: By the logic in the narration, climate change has always been irreversible, ever since CO2 began to rise. There is no particular point where it became irreversible. The title suggests that climate change has passed some point of no return, beyond which even a cessation of emissions would not stop the process.

The climate change we have now is very different from all others that have gone before, a ""simple fact"" that you have chosen to ignore (or failed to learn about). The RATE at which the climate is changing is no longer on a geological time scale, as other such events have been; it is now on a human time scale. Example: A heat spike in one year (2016) killed about 1/3 of the barrier reef, and that is part of a larger heat spike that is already at a full degree Celsius in just a few human lifetimes.That kind of thing has not happened before; what we are seeing is nothing like previous changes.

According to the 2001 IPCC report, &quot;climate is a coupled, non-linear chaotic system and therefore the long term prediction of future climate states is NOT possible&quot;. This is why all climate modeling has been so wildly inaccurate over time. All 107 have been failures to predict future climate conditions. The reason is two-fold. The first thing wrong is that they have not reduced the climate sensitivity on the GCMs, adhering to AGW orthodoxy. We now know that sensitivity might be less than 25% of what was once believed. <br /><br />The second problem is even more difficult. They simply haven&#39;t enough actual measured data to simulate such a huge dynamic system as our planet. More than 90% of the temperature readings over land are artificial, rather than measured data. Over the oceans (72% of the earth&#39;s surface) the amount of real data is infinitesimal. All the rest of the input for the models is interpolated material ... not real data. Science relies on data ... real, factual observations, not estimates of estimates of extrapolations.<br /><br />In other words Susan Solomon&#39;s models are rubbish because they use even less actual data than the Global Circulation Models which operate so poorly at present. Her models run faster because they rely on even less information. These new &quot;models&quot; are nothing short of fear mongering ... but Solomon, et al will never have to account for their failure because it&#39;s projected centuries beyond their life span. But if we believe and act on such poorly conceived &quot;science&quot; the cost to us, here and now will be devastating. Carbon capture is not only wildly expensive, it&#39;s among the most idiotic &quot;solutions&quot; to a non existent problem there is.",UCPfPyFIV5GjhrEYEXIfjx8A,0,UgyPyGSpl10zvthFjx54AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

It's entirely explainable with ""there actually is a problem and other factors haven't played as big of a role in recent climate change"" The fact that the raw data is publicly available means the rounding would be meaningless argument if they actually do that. We can measure the solar output from the Earth, we don't have to go to Mars to do that. It doesn't explain the warming trend we see, in fact, solar activity is working directly against temperature rise on Earth. A good representation here https://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=5 About exaggerating CO2 effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17mKIKGEF5E The amount of CO2 compared to anything else is meaningless. Beside water vapor (condensable greenhouse gas which means it only acts as an amplifier), CO2 is the biggest (non-condensable) one. Concentrations don't mean the effects are just as small. Ozone is 0.000007% of the atmosphere and it protects us from harmful solar radiation. Nobody claims ozone isn't doing anything. Something has to cause that change. The cause matters. The there have been worse or better times in the past doesn't matter one bit. Not every change was good for organisms. And why wouldn't this research, which claimed climate scientists were being dishonest, be dishonest itself? What makes it believable? How does my analogy say that natural variables are irrelevant? Nothing of the sort. The computer models include the biggest spectrum of variables known. I wouldn't take the word of anyone who doesn't actually show me the model. Where do you take that volcanoes for example aren't factored in? How much do volcanoes actually produce in a year? How much do humans emit? Please show me the numbers. Nobody predicts doom.

The problem I have with the whole of climate change research, is the ease with which natural variables are ignored all together if the data can be used to push the peer narrative. For instance, why must NOAA data be always rounded up when recording averages, why is the solar cycle and its effects on other planets never brought into account when clearly see the same thing happening on other planets in our solar system? The narrative is that it is humans alone causing climate change. Thats not true in the slightest. A recent study showed the effects CO2 in the atmosphere has far less impact than we previously thought. The amount of CO2 in our atmosphere is such a tiny fraction of the overall gases present and is only being increased by hundredths of a parts per million. Deceptively scientists like to say things like what is being said in this paper, 3000 years from now our planet is doomed. The truth is we have had extremely Co2 rich periods of time in the past and we are just fine today. I believe very intensely that the planet is going through changes but do not believe in the least that humans are the root cause.

In power engineering there is typical &quot;power flow&quot; and as you expect the power flows from generators to homes.

This will cause power companies nearly shut down their generators to prevent over generation in mid day when solar output is maximum. <br /><br />Lines may become overloaded because distrubution lines were designed to go from a power source to a power consumer; not power source to power source to consumer like the internet would act. Like line voltages are rated based on the amount of customers its designed to feed. Power=IV and the I (current) is what makes the line hot. So power companies up the voltage to deliver the same power (the trade off is that the line is more dangerous and requires more isolation at high voltage). The further away you get from generation the voltage level goes down as there should be less load. But if you&#39;re a generator, then you&#39;ll increase load on the line which was not designed to take that load.<br /><br />If your solar panels are producing fuel, then your solar installation is not injecting power into the line.

We often talk about CO2 absorbing light, so you might expect that by removing CO2 the sun will become brighter in the sky. However substances don't absorb all light equally, and CO2 specifically absorbs infra-red wavelengths. So this is light which lies outside our visible spectrum, meaning you can't see it with your eyes. If you *could* see infra-red though, the sun wouldn't look brighter if we removed a bunch of CO2 from the atmosphere, as the sun's light is actually mostly in the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum (so light we can see and stuff which has wavelengths shorter than blue light). Instead, the Earth would look brighter, as the Earth emits light in the infra-red (which, remember, we can't see). So to answer your question, no the sun wouldn't look brighter in the sky if we removed a load of CO2 because it absorbs wavelengths of light which we can't see, and which the sun doesn't emit.

I read a report recently, that said we could be looking at very soon, having the possibility of removing up to 950 tons of Co2 per year. Not Gigatons, or billions of tons........just tons. lol.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think that is really going to do anything to offset the effects of the other approximately 31 gigatons tons, that we&#39;re dumping into the atmosphere, per year. <br /><br />Now.....I agree with a lot of what you say, but, you&#39;re also using some pretty conservative science in your presentation. (Understatement of the year right there.) <br /><br /> First off, there is no surviving into the next few centuries. Let&#39;s just scratch that one right off the bat. Humanity, and all the rest of life on Earth, will be gone by the end of THIS century. I&#39;m not sure where exactly you&#39;re getting your figures that take you out that far, but, no scientist that I know of is even considering the notion of life going beyond the end of this century. <br /><br />How do I figure this? Well, OK, you, yourself, seem to understand that there really isn&#39;t any hope of negative emissions having any impact on keeping carbon levels down, or removing it from the atmosphere, right? I mean, you say that it is unlikely that we&#39;re ever going to reach substantial negative emissions. Those are your exact words. <br /><br />So, knowing this, I find it impossible to understand how you can even consider such a foolish notion that we&#39;re going to last a few centuries into the future. <br /><br />Do you know what the Paris Climate Agreement is? I&#39;m betting you do......or, at least, you&#39;ve heard of it. But.....do you know what it ACTUALLY entails? Do you know why the Politicians were so excited, and celebrated the signing of it so much?<br /><br />It is because, they were told an entirely different story about what we need to do, to keep the temperature below 2 C warming, than what the actual scientists said we need to do. The IPCC scientists said that we need to get GLOBAL Co2 emissions to ZERO, by 2035, to even have a PRAYER of keeping the temp below 2C warmer. <br /><br />The Politicians we told an entirely different story. They were basically told.....nah....we don&#39;t really need to do much of anything. We need to MAYBE drop the emissions a tiny little bit for a few years, and then we can go right on with business as usual, because of........drum roll........negative emission technology!!! YAY!!! So, they all signed the very non-binding, non-committal to anything agreement, and held hands and cheered!! <br /><br />We&#39;re not going to get global Co2 emissions to zero by 2035. We&#39;re not going to have any negative emission technology in place by 2035. <br /><br />When you use the correct timeline for what is considered, &quot;pre-industrial&quot;, which is 1750, you will find that we&#39;re already at 1.6, to 1.8 degrees warmer. Right now....today. <br /><br />1.5 C, is already in the rear-view mirror. 2 C, is literally right around the corner. We&#39;re most likely going to be there by 2020. There&#39;s too much other information to get into in this conversation. This is already getting long. 2 C in and of itself is a joke. (the notion of staying below it) That figure was set by an economist, not a climate scientist. And then, they try to keep us in the dark, by constantly moving the goalposts around. You hear all kinds of different numbers about where we&#39;re at as far as temperature rise etc......it all depends on the start date. Well....the majority of scientists use 1750. Somebody suddenly picked 1850 out of a hat at one point, and that is why you&#39;ll hear that we&#39;re only at about 1 degree warmer, or maybe 1.1. <br /><br />The Arctic could go &quot;ice free&quot;, this summer. It probably won&#39;t happen, but it could. But, even if it doesn&#39;t happen this year, it is most likely GOING to, by 2020. <br /><br />The US Naval Academy predicted it would be ice free in 2016, +/- 3 years. We&#39;ve dodged the minus 3 years, it&#39;s not looking like we&#39;re going to dodge the +3 years. <br /><br />When that happens, we&#39;ll be lucky if we have 10 years to live from that point. The global temperature will skyrocket, the jetstream will be essentially non-existent, and you&#39;ll have either extreme drought conditions, or extreme flooding conditions, depending on which side of it you&#39;re on. The feedback loops that are already taking place right now, will accelerate exponentially. <br /><br />Keep in mind that my 10 year figure is my own. And I&#39;m being very liberal there. Some scientists say that we&#39;ll have around 5 years to live, after the Arctic goes ice free. <br /><br />All I&#39;m really saying is.....you&#39;re kinda right, but, you&#39;re pretty far behind the 8 ball bud.",UCgdcu13ifI5H3J64E1Ug-8A,0,UgwGnzTZgJMvmuVtROR4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

In fact they even state in their abstract that ""At multi-decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them.""

I'll deal with each link in a separate post. With regard to the surface radiative forcing of CO2 experiments: Firstly, the experiment determined that CO2 forcing is only 68% of what was expected from AGW climate models. Using the IPCC formula one calculates that the radiative forcing of CO2, based on the measured increase in CO2 concentration, should have been 0.29W/m2. Instead it was measured as 0.2W/m2. So that's the first problem. Secondly the experiment found that CO2 forcing accounts for only 10% of radiative forcing. Is it possible that water vapour is responsible for most DLWR and not CO2? At the very least, this experiment confirms what many have accepted long ago, that CO2 is responsible for only a tenth of DLWR radiation. The experiment does show an increase in DLWR forcing however, so let's explore a possible cause. As you will note, the experiment period started during a la Nina cycle and ended during an el Nino cycle. This accounted for a half a degree increase in tropospheric temperatures during the experiment period. Since warmer air results in more DLWR, could the increase in tropospheric temperature have caused the increase in DLWR? ""But the greenhouse feedback mechanism will eventually result in more water vapour which will cause a further increase in DLWR!"" I hear you protest. Well let's go to the temperature records to find out. It might interest you to note that in Alaska during the 2000 to 2010 there was no increase in surface temperatures. And in fact during the 2010 to 2011 period immediately following the experiment, mean temperatures in Alaska fell by around 4 degrees, resulting in the coldest temperature recorded in 94 years. So in fact it looks like this experiment proves that the greenhouse feedback mechanism is a thing of fantasy.",UCuZx5QMw8U4_gDuNdgb5qBw,1,UgzqEcA6uS84r5rZdLF4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The burden of proof lies with those who believe that CO2 does rise the Earth's temperature more than a tiny fraction of the total amount. So far that has not happened. If you want to know why that is, read Richard Lindzen or Judith Curry. The issue is a thing called climate sensitivity. No one with any knowledge of the subject is saying that CO2 hasn't some effect in warming the planet, but that effect is very small and occurs most powerfully with the 1st 100 or so parts per million. From there on its ability to trap long wave radiation diminishes logarithmically. This is well known. Also, below around 150 ppm there is too little CO2 to support plant growth.

There is no question, that it is our CO₂ and other greenhouse gases that are the cause of the temperature rise today in this epoch. Isotopic analysis of the proportion of C12, C13 and decline of C14 confirms that fossil fuels are the cause, and that to have any hope of keeping a planet worth living on it must remain in the ground, and ways must be found to get it back out of the atmosphere and back into the ground so it can't continue to overheat our home and cause all kinds of mayhem from species extinctions, refugees from droughts, sea level rise, storms and food and water shortages.

Indeed you didn&#39;t even mention it by its name.<br /><br />We humans dump the equivalent of 292,000 volcanoes worth of Co2 into the natural carbon cycle every 12 months. Rising at roughly 3% a year. We do this to service an economic system that demands perpetual growth. That system is called capitalism, the cause behind the symptom of rapid climate change.<br /><br />Economics:<br />Capitalism doubles in size over just 30 years requiring a doubling of energy and many materials needed to feed it. It must grow or it collapses due to its own systemic contradictions. Its need for energy cannot be tapered, modified, changed, it has remained consistent in that growth for 450 years.<br /><br />Indeed so voracious is this system that we have consumed most of the easily available oil and gas reserves which have forced us to frack. People often say yey or ney to fracking but rarely do they ask why w are fracking to begin with and even more rarely is the occasions when someone bothers to tell them:<br /><a href=""https://armyofall.wordpress.com/fracking-coal-you-are-asking-the-wrong-questions/"">https://armyofall.wordpress.com/fracking-coal-you-are-asking-the-wrong-questions/</a><br /><br />Renewable energy, insufficient pixey dust:<br />After 40 years of installing renewable energy we are at around 15% of total global power generation via renewables. This is pitiful. Its even worse when we consider energy = only 30% of our carbon emissions overall.<br /><br />We should have had a solar panel on every roof and a wind turbine on every chimney in the UK and beyond by now, produced for the cost of labour and materials only, via regional workers co-operatives. Instead what we have is a handful of for profit capitalist corporations installing renewables at a snails pace to what is required on behalf of another handful of massive energy corporations, in order to ensure the energy corporations maintain their market share forcing us to BUY our energy from them perpetually regardless of the source. <br /><br />Only the wealthy can afford to purchase their own energy Independence. Given 65% of the UK earns less than £28K a year I don&#39;t expect their homes to be covered any time soon.<br /><br />The Future:<br />There was also absolutely no point talking about the year 3000, it takes a roughly -5oC avg drop to take us to an ice age, we are on course for +3.5oC rise minimum by 2100, it does not take a wild imagination to understand the ramifications of that. Certain crops don&#39;t do too well under such scenarios. Neither do people under sustained +50oC (roughly a billion along the equatorial line) and neither does the East antarctic ice shelf. <br /><br />Sea Level rise:<br />I am sure you saw this study:<br /><a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/2171563-alarm-as-ice-loss-from-antarctica-triples-in-the-past-five-years/"">https://www.newscientist.com/article/2171563-alarm-as-ice-loss-from-antarctica-triples-in-the-past-five-years/</a><br /><br />In this they state sea level rise of 3 meters by 2100, <br /><br />&quot;In particular, a 2016 computer modelling study concluded that Antarctica alone could lose enough ice by 2100 to raise sea level by 2 metres. This means overall sea level could rise by more than 3m by 2100&quot;<br /><br />That in of itself is a bloody disaster, but they are missing a factor that will likely add yet another meter by 2100 according to current research being conducted. Greenland Ice sheet algae bloom due to warmer temperatures plus rampant Cryoconite formation, both of which decrease albedo increasing surface melt, none of this is factored into current forecasts according to the scientists conducting the research.<br /><br />Carbon removal.<br />The idea of removing carbon from the air and turning it back into fuel is older than dust, papers on the subject go back decades. In 2016 Carbon Engineering Ltd put up 8 million dollars of the company for investors to buy, they only sold 3 million dollars worth. Now they have announced this bit of fantasy I am sure they will sell the remaining 5 million without issue.<br /><br />Taking the average cost per ton removed it would only cost $6.4 trillion to remove just one years worth of human emissions at todays rates, a bargain, I can just hear world leaders scribbling out the cheques as I type. And I didn&#39;t even mention the global infrastructure required for it to be possible. But then neither did the Washington post.<br /><br />Its called blowing smoke up your arse via media. Elon Musk does it all the time.<br /><br />The End:<br />So, to summarise, if you are going to talk about climate change, start making people aware of the system that is driving it, and make damned sure you tell them the truth, that capitalism, an anti democratic and unstable economic system is incompatible with solving rapid climate change, the problem it has created.<br /><br />And if you don&#39;t believe me, here is Professor Kevin Anderson to take you through it in 9 minutes:<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/EprNPlSe6co"">https://youtu.be/EprNPlSe6co</a><br /><br />And here is our current temperatures outstripping our worst case scenarios, governments have been making policy based on our models, not on reality.

In the 3 days after 9/11, the planet experienced a unique 3 day total stop on commercial aviation. The loss of those sulfites caused a 1 degree celcius rise.

Jim Hansen has analysed the recent paper you quote, on CO2 drawdown, and he concludes that the cost is grossly under-calculated, effectively meaning that the costs are much too prohibitive for national economies to consider budgeting for or implementing.  <br /><br />Our annual human output of of CO2 is about 30 gigatons which is over and above the  natural cycle of 750 gigatons circulating each year. <br /><br />The oceans absorb about 40% of this additional CO2 thus increasing ocean acidification in the process. The other 60% remains in the atmosphere, continually building up each year and remaining in the atmosphere for millennia​. The industrial age has raised the level of atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm to 410 ppm in 150 odd years.

The sun has been cooling on average for 4 decades so there must be something else that increases the temperature on Earth. (wonder where all you get this ""grand solar minimum"" thing, hint hint) The CO2 historically followed temperature because it acted as an amplifier due to positive feedback, like water vapor. Something increased temperature first then CO2 acted as an amplifier for that warming period. Unlike water vapor, you can directly add CO2 into the atmosphere without rising the temperature first and that is happening now, making the entire ""it follows temperature"" argument pointless.

The Earth is always cooling or warming at any given time. That is natural.<br />Normally it takes thousands of years for global average temperatures to change just 1 degree Celsius.<br />Through the burning of fossil fuels we have already raised global average temperatures 1.9 C from the 1750-1800 average. 0.9 C of that has happened in the past 5 years. It&#39;s not that the Earth is warming that is so worrisome. It&#39;s the SPEED in which it is warming that is alarming. Between February 2015 and February 2016, global average temperature grew 0.56 C degrees. That&#39;s half a degree in just 1 year.<br />There are some important facts to know here. We need to know just what sort of warming the Earth is getting from current greenhouse gases. Thankfully scientists already know this. The Earth if it had no greenhouse gases would be too cold to support life. The water at the equator would be frozen solid and the atmosphere would be too cold to even have weather.<br />The earth is warmed by greenhouse gases by 31.6 degrees Celsius and this warming allows life to exist.<br />However, having too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.<br />Look up &quot;W5: What Happens When The Permafrost Thaws?&quot; In the video report that was released November 11th 2017, the scientist states that there is roughly twice the amount of greenhouse gases in the permafrost as there currently is in our atmosphere.<br />You already know how much warming our current greenhouse gas levels do. Try to imagine what it would be like if it was tripled. Not a pretty sight is it?<br />Now look up &quot;20% of the permafrost will thaw by 2040&quot;. Look for the VOX report. It has a link to the actual scientific papers that was published. <br />You read it right. 20% will thaw by 2040 just 22 years away. A 20% thaw will raise global average temperatures by roughly 13 degrees Celsius. Nobody will survive that. During the PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) which happened 55.5 million years ago, the Earth warmed up 8 degrees more than current temperatures. The equatorial regions were unlivable and polar regions were tropical zones. That event wiped out 75% of all life and took hundreds of thousands years to unfold. <br />We will see a minimum of 13 degrees C within the next 22 years.<br />The only reason 25% of life survived the PETM was because it had time to adapt, migrate and evolve. That won&#39;t happen within 22 years.<br />So what are our options? It looks like Elon Musk has the right idea. Leave the planet.<br />World governments know full well just as much as the scientists know. They know we are screwed beyond belief. They know that if any of this was to get out to the public, politicians would meet a very violent demise as the masses rise up against them.<br />That is why they have to keep a lid on it all. Politicians are very good at deceiving the public. They will often distract you with other nonsense. Donald Trump knows Global warming is real. It&#39;s why he raised the seawalls on his gold course at Mar a lago. But he won&#39;t tell the public that. Instead the government distracts you with scandal after scandal.<br />Global Warming is real and politicians know it. They deny it to the public because they want to save their own skins.<br />Today&#39;s governments are going to try to ease our way into extinction by providing us with the creature comforts of civilization. They will try everything they can.<br />Unfortunately it won&#39;t be enough. Plants grow with a very specific range of temperatures. Change that range and the plants die off. That is what Climate Change is doing. That is already affecting our crop production. With less crops there will be less to export so only the better customers will get the imports.<br />Venezuela has ran out of food. People have taken to the countryside killing anything and everything just to get a meal on the table. That will happen here as food crops continue to decline their production. Cities have to have food transported in. You will see grocery chains closing so that the food transported in can still fill the shelves of the remaining stores. That will keep happening. Watch for it.<br />Every climate plan I have seen to date will take far too long to implement. We have maybe 3-4 years before the food runs out due to warming caused by the thawing permafrost. 9 years before all mankind goes extinct. All of the climate plans I have seen take far longer than that.<br />Nothing is going to stop the permafrost from thawing.",UCwOJFU-RaF-3aoghgOupqXw,0,UgwJKvQ6__H0VeFUeVN4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Last year all of the carbon capture units removed 31 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere. Now whereas that sounds like a lot, it really isn't. We emitted through the burning of fossil fuels 52 billion tonnes of CO2 last year. Carbon capture doesn't even scratch the surface. It doesn't even cover for the amount of forests that are being cut down (deforestation) or burned by wildfires. Wildfires also emit CO2 into the atmosphere and those trees absorb CO2. Now you need to look at just where those carbon capture units are being placed. Right in the factories usually beside the smokestacks. So they really are not for taking CO2 out of the atmosphere at all. They are meant to reduce emissions coming from factories so that more factories can be built. There is fantasy and there is reality. Scientists usually come up with some new technology and then someone else comes along and twists the technology to fit their own nefarious plans. Nuclear power was meant to give us unlimited energy but ended up being used to create nuclear weapons.

If there are both positive and negative feedback loops - that only means they would either cancel each other out, or they average out into one positive feedback loop, or a negative one. If it's positive or negative, the Earth would've been screwed from the get go regardless of humans. Therefore, when there's no human input, the Earth's CO2 levels must be _self correcting_ , i.e. when CO2 levels are too high, the negative feedback loops have more punch, and when CO2 is too low, the positive feedback loops win over. Only this scenario would create an equilibrium allowing CO2 levels to remain stable over time, any other scenario would have CO2 levels spiral exponentially to either 0 or infinity due to effects of chaos. And if that's the case, then while an additional human input of CO2 will produce a temporary rise in temperature, eventually we will again find a natural equilibrium, because although we've increased the CO2 levels, because we've done that, the net negative feedback loops will become more pronounced, while the net positive feedback loops will diminish, and (as long as human CO2 input is constant), they'll be a point where the loops once again reach equilibrium. I can make an analogy with air resistance vs gravity. As you know, falling objects have air resistance, and the faster the velocity, the more air resistance. Therefore this is an example of a negative feedback loop, because if a falling object momentarily goes faster than the terminal velocity where air resistance and gravity are in equilibrium, then the object slows back down to terminal velocity. Likewise, if the object momentarily goes slower than the terminal velocity, gravity win over the air resistance, creating a positive feedback loop, and making the object speed back to terminal velocity. Any other universe where the object didn't have a positive feedback loop when going to slow AND a negative feedback loop when going to fast, would inevitably result in the object either coming to a complete stop or speeding up indefinitely. Now in this analogy, human input of CO2 is equivalent to reducing the object's surface area. By doing so, you'll have decreased the force of air resistance, making the object fall faster/have a higher terminal velocity. But the same positive/negative feedback loops apply, so although the object will temporarily fall faster, it will inevitably reach a new terminal velocity again, where the feedback loops cancel out and it's all ok. Is this correct?",UC4ksCts5h9D4kl5cwZ07qcQ,1,UgwJ8uIsgFRWHzsH_r94AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Human output of CO2 is over 30 billion tons per year, and a faction of that gets absorbed in the ocean, about 10 or 15. So what we need to off-set just to break even, never mind bringing 410 PPM down a bit, would be about 15 x 40 billion trees or 600 billion trees.

Do you think it would feel very normal to us if the oceans rose 100 feet? Cause that's what you're talking about. *If CO2 were to drop below 150 PPM all life on Earth would go extinct* - yes, I'm familiar with that one.

Volcanic lava and ash is of significant mass but the actual long term gas added by volcanoes is considerably less than the man made CO2 added to the air. Alex says 1%. That's probably about right. Rory Forbes is a fox news educated nitwit. Yes, human emissions pale in comparison to nature, but nature is part of the Carbon cycle, it's very balanced. Nature adds and removes about a trillion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year - in balance. Human fossil fuel use adds about 30 billion tons every year and that's not in balance. About half, or a little less than half goes into the ocean as a result of the increased concentration in the air, but as the oceans warm, that may stop. We're adding CO2 to a well balanced carbon cycle, pushing it out of balance. That's why CO2 is increasing, from 280 PPM 200 years ago to nearly 410 PPM today. Volcanoes are largely irrelevant and they actually have a cooling effect. We'd need a once in a million year volcano for this conversation to actually be relevant and if that happens, we'll have other problems to deal with. As for what the beginning of an ice age looks like, the beginning of anything can be hard to spot, but what we know of Milankovich cycles, ice ages begin when northern hemisphere/arctic summers get colder. Colder summers melt the snow more slowly and that allows the snow cover to build up. As the snow builds, the ground grows lighter in color which reflects more sunlight which helps the Earth get a little cooler. Over time and if enough ice builds, the oceans start to cool as well from the colder air and as the oceans cool, CO2 is absorbed and the Earth cools even more and if this continues, you have an ice age - until the Earth's orbit returns and Northern Hemisphere summers start to warm up and the entire process reverses.",UCRhPF-_VTB8gDtU84f9gTEQ,1,Ugy6ZT13McpSbUOD23t4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

To whatever extent GCR's influence temperature, in combination with lower solar activity and a weaker magnetosphere, they are the only explanation to explain past warming and cooling periods (skip to the end if you are lazy or don't have much time for this debate, I did write quite a bit). https://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screenhunter_363-mar-06-19-17.jpg?w=640&amp;h=268 Here is solar activity correlating with the Maunder Minimum or the ""little ice age"" as well as our current warming period called the Modern Maximum. I'm sure you already know that temperature affects co2 just as much or more than co2 affects temperature. Also, that study doesn't seem to be looking at the correlation between increased cloud cover and temperature, but how much GCRs produce clouds in our magnetospheres current state, which is a good argument but doesn't directly refute anything. But, I'm willing to concede that it may not be the primary cause of climate change, but if it's not, then what is? Co2 follows solar activity and temperature (except when humans release it) so we know that it is also not the primary cause. I didn't say there were ""normal co2 levels."" I said during ""normal times"" as in non-ice age times, co2 was upwards of 2,000 ppm. I appreciate your knowledge of the overall decline in co2 over the last 500 million years. If Co2 levels drop below 150 ppm, virtually all life on Earth will go extinct and Earth will probably go back into another snowball earth state. The Sun's luminosity has only increased by about 3% over the last 500 million years, though 3% is a lot with anything in the context of climate, its fluctuating minima and maxima have a much larger impact on climate variation. Despite the fact that solar luminosity is higher than it has ever been, Earth is currently near all-time low temperatures, probably because of the low co2 (and the low co2 could actually be caused by increased solar activity as co2 will evaporate into space at higher temperatures). You could just as easily argue that solar activity has had an even greater contribution to our current warming trend than we thought due to its increased luminosity. We know that 150 mya, co2 was upwards of 2,000 ppm while solar luminosity was less than 1% lower than today. It is extremely unlikely that 400, or even 1,000 ppm will cause runaway greenhouse effect. In addition, Earth is also gradually increasing in its distance from the sun so the 3% could have little to no effect on temperature. Of course, rapid changes in climate will cause extinction. We still have many animals alive today that made their adaptations and escaped extinction from the last glacial period. They will die because they have evolved to very cold temperatures, and have adapted to places where no other organisms can live because it is too cold. During ""normal times,"" places like Canada and Siberia revert to rainforest, so the loss of specialized animals is totally overcompensated for in the massive increase of biomass that warm temperatures bring. My basic argument is this: AGW is real, but it is exaggerated for political purposes. CO2 does indeed affect temperature, but considering we are right around the corner from a solar minimum (which should be even colder than the Maunder minimum), and after that an approaching glacial period, we may delaying an even more devastating climatic change. The current warming trend is a combination of anthropogenic CO2 and solar activity (as well as many other factors). The 100 or so ppm of co2 we have added turned a normal solar maximum temperature rise, into one just a tiny bit faster and warmer than normal. Its rate is unprecedented in only the last 23,000 years, and its magnitude is unprecedented in only the last 2,000. This 13,000-year long interglacial will soon give way to a 100,000-year long glacial period. Warm temperatures are the last thing you should be worried about.

The current levels of warming (the rate of change) are simply too high for adaption. That is the problem we are facing. It might be true that somewhat higher temperatures are not that terrible in the very very long run (hundreds of thousands to millions of years), if the change happened slowly enough. It will have a negative effect on the lower latitudes, but a possible positive effect on the higher latitudes in terms of bioproductivity. Given that the amount of landmass in the lower latitudes is much greater, that is not a great trade. But we are talking about warming measured in decades to centuries.

But the sun played a huge role in why it was not as hot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_luminosity During that time, solar luminosity was several percent lower than today. That may not sound a lot, but the usual solar cycles we see today are on the order of one-tenth of a percent change in luminosity and that already shows a well observable effect.

We are currently at the end of the Holocene interglacial and within that, we are currently at the end of a solar maximum called the Modern Maximum which started around the industrial revolution. Glacial periods are caused by increased cloud cover which blocks out the sun. Increased cloud cover is ultimately caused by lower solar activity: solar minimums. Ever heard of the little ice age of 1600? The next one is due about 30 years from now and it will be much colder. And that's only a solar minimum, the full impact of the glacial period will cause far more extinction than we as humans could ever hope to accomplish. _This_ is what an ice age looks like (an interglacial period of an ice age anyway). During normal times, Earth averages about 2,000 ppm of co2 without any problems, in fact, life seems to thrive in these conditions. If co2 were to drop below 150 ppm, all life on Earth would go extinct as photosynthetic organisms die off. During the Precambrian supereon, co2 was as high as 9,000 ppm and no runaway greenhouse effect, and no scorching Earth. We are much closer to being _low_ on co2 than we are to having an excess of it.

I have eight 100 amp hour batteries. The batteries run our lights and charge our cell phones, tablets and laptops. The solar panels run nothing. They only recharge the batteries. Anyone who has studied solar systems and installs them, knows this. I have a 3,500 watt inverter. It will surge to 5,000 watts. This means i need minimum 5 deep cycle batteries, or I may fry my inverter. So, I have 8 batteries. The 8 batteries allow up to 8,000 watts of draw. If I had 8 X 100 Watt Solar Panels (*,000 Watts or 8KW) and 2 batteries, I would fry my system. It would be constantly going down and my two batteries would not even last a couple months. The solar panels are Solar Chargers. The Charge Controller limits how much the panels will charge, so I do not over charge my batteries. I have a 12 volt DC system. The solar panels put out 18 volts sometimes. The charge controller steps it down to a 13.2-14.5 volt current. The charge controller take the solar panels energy and uses it to charge the batteries, or to keep them charged. We do not run the fans 24 hours a day. We do not run the laptops, tablets or net books 24 hours a day. Only our cell phones are on all day. Well sometimes we charge them in the car going down the road, or charge them at work, so even they are not on the solar bank all the time. The batteries only need to be recharged the amount that is taken. It I run the 1,200 watt microwave for 2 minutes to heat a hot dog and chili, the solar will replace that long before the sun goes down. It is about knowing how to calculate your uses and having more than enough batteries to do it. Then the proper solar array to replace what you use on average. We also have a 1,600/2,000 watt generator and a 3,500/5,000 watt generator. We rarely use them. Yes, I have a battery charge running of my house power, but it is a variable charger that does 1.5 amps to keep the bank topped off, or up to 8 amps to ramp up the charging, but when it is topped out at 8 amps, it is only drawing about 200 watts. I only use it when I need to, which may be once a month for a day or so. Keep in mind that most of the time it is not even running at 8 amps. It supplements the solar panels if needed. The batteries run things. The Solar charges the batteries. My battery cables, the copper wire is about as thick as an adult mans thumb. The solar panels wires are tiny as a #2 pencil lead. Not a #2 pencil, but the lead inside the pencil. How is that going to run a microwave oven, toaster, waffle iron, hair dryer, 40 inch TV or most of the other things inside a home? Size the Battery Bank first, then the solar panels next and then the appropriate charge controller. We use cables one size heavier than needed, so we never stress the system. It is always best to use thicker wires than needed. Have multiple inverters. Do not use a 3,500 watt inverter to run a 24 inch TV. Use a 450 watt or 700 watt inverter. Our inverters 3,500 watt 2,000 watt 750 watt 450 watt 250 watt 125 watt Some things that are AC power, people run on DC power and do not even use an inverter. The reason is that if it uses 120 volts AC and it has no computer type technology inside it, like a basic toaster, toaster oven, hair dryer, drill, skill saw and such. It only wants the 120 volts. People will series their batteries and 10 batteries that are 12 volt in series will give 120 volts. You can see people run these things on DC, from their battery bank. Usually only in emergency situations, but it can be done. Kid; ""Now I know."" G.I.

That is way cheaper than it used to be. You should know that every home is not the same. We have 95 watts in solar panels and yet we have eight 12 volt 100 amp hour batteries. After replacing our bulbs with LED bulbs, changing to gas cooking and low amp refrigerators, switching from four 1,500 watt desktop computers to 120 watt laptops, canning so we do not need large refrigerators and freezer, using out cell phones, tablets and netbooks, instead of our laptops, getting a 40 inch 120 watt TV and a 24 inch 12 volt DC TV, a couple portable DVD players that run on 12 volts DC, using the Air Conditioner only when we need it and a few other things. Our Utilities bill went from $600 a month to about $120 a month. That $480 a month is almost $5,000 a year. We live in Florida so we get a lot of sun. We also have an electric water heater and a gas water heater. It cost to do all these things, but we save almost $500 a month. That is over $5,000 a year. Yes, we have 95 watts in solar panels. They are 15 watt panels and we have six of them. When the last hurricane hit Florida, the city power was out for weeks. We still had lights, internet, fans, charging for our tables, cell phones and net books. We gave up out four 1,500 watt desktop gaming computers for gaming laptops that use 120 watts each. We just charge them as we need to. Start small and upgrade over time. It took us almost a year to have our system with the eight batteries. More batteries are important, because the solar panes do not run anything. The batteries run everything, but the solar panels only charge the batteries.

I have seen a deal (admittedly subsidised through STCs) for 5-6kW of solar and an LG Chem 6.4kWh battery under $10k installed. Would not take very long to pay that off at all, about half the warranty period maybe where I live. There are some efficiencies coming through the technology chain, not sure where it's at but there is one effort that looks promising which effectively has multiple cells for different wavelengths of light. As for EV's, even when built using coal, and powered with the average grid, and the cost of making the battery, they *still* produce less pollutants over just a few years (3-4 depending where you live, lower if you have solar).

Pretending solar panels are somehow the magical solution to pollution is one of the biggest lies ever told. The effectiveness of solar panels, or rather the lack thereof is a huge problem. Manufacturing more efficient panels is basically impossible, because of the whole way the reception of energy works. You can't shrink it all down indefinitely expecting a higher efficiency. And then I haven't even spoken about how you actually need to track the sun for optimal angles, which in turn costs energy. Don't get me wrong, yes, you will get energy from solar power panels. But it is absolutely not the magical solution. If a solar power panel breaks, it is also hardly biodegradable lol, so you're still stuck with waste there anyway. It's a total non-solution.

When compared to buying cheap poor quality PV cells and chucking them in calculators that are manufactured in the thousands you can see the why there is a price disparity.

He is either dumb or lying then because in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owm25OHGglk at 36:00  (at 36:00) you can SEE him go on to speak about the classic experiment where if you put an ice cube in a glass of water and the ice cube melts the result is that the water level goes down (that is according to Tim Ball; it is well known that the correct result is that the water level stays the same). He then goes on to conclude that sea level will decline when the ice caps melt, and emphasizes that that is something that they don't tell you. I kid you not this is coming from the mouth of someone who purports to be a climatologist. It gets worse, at 28:00 he says the following ""....That the temperature changes before the CO2 changes. But what is the fundamental assumption that they have....if CO2 goes up then the temperature will go up. That doesn't occur at in any record at any time in the world's history"". I kid you not, all you have to do is do a Google search for ""Graphs where CO2 causes temperature to rise"" where the search is restricted to Pictures. You can find a variety of Graphs which show CO2 rise causes an increase in temperature. I find the one at this link interesting https://www.livescience.com/19481-ice-age-carbon-dioxide-orbit.html. It is interesting because it shows how a Warming which started in the Antarctic caused CO2 to rise which in turn caused the average temperature of the earth to rise (and hence warming on the rest of the globe). It is important to understand that warming increases CO2 and CO2 increase increases warming (they cause each other). Now you can say whatever you want. BUT YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT THESE FACTS IF YOU WANT TO BE HONEST TO YOURSELF. Tim Ball is not a serious scientist, he lies freely and unfortunately his power to persuade is much more when he is willing to lie.

How could I be ignoring the fact that plants die (and re-release CO2 back into the air, when in fact, I was talking about the soil and even said _trees_ are not ""really"" the solution (because of this very fact). However, if you want combative, I will remind you that some trees live to many hundreds of years old, and so, they are not ""really"" part of the problem either. It's the soil, especially new soil. I'm not a farmer, however, have looked into good soil. without it, we wouldn't even exist! And that's definitely part of the carbon cycle. Concerning the math, I assume that we all know the gigatons of excess CO2 by simple search. I can't find the link to SOC, so, I'm pasting another that leads to a paywall. This is just the first few paragraphs, shown. Blockquote Maintaining sustainable and environmentally friendly fresh produce production in the context of climate change D. Pimentel, M. Burgess, in Global Safety of Fresh Produce, 2014 10.3.1 Carbon Soil carbon, which correlates with the soil organic matter levels, was measured in 1981 and 2002. In 1981, the soil carbon levels were about the same (about 2%) in both the organic and conventional systems (Pimentel et al., 2005). In 2002, however, the soil organic matter in the organic systems was about 5%, whereas in the conventional system, it remained about 2%. The higher soil organic matter levels found in the organic systems cause the soil to retain more water that results in better crop yields during droughts, reduces soil erosion, increases plant nutrient retention and increases biological diversity. There was about 4000 kg per ha of soil carbon in the conventional system but about 10 000 kg per ha of soil carbon in the organic system in 2002. The higher water content accounted for the higher corn and soybean yields during the drought years faced by these systems (Lotter et al., 2003). Higher soil organic matter levels cause greater soil nitrogen retention, greater microbial biodiversity, and promote the presence and growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that penetrate the roots of crops and facilitate the movement of plant nutrients from the soil into the crop plants resulting in better crop growth and yields (Pimentel et al., 2005). Higher soil carbon levels also hold soil particles together so less soil erosion occurs (Pimentel et al., 2005). End blockquote From https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-carbon So, If I go with 5 tonnes/hectare, that's 500,000 tonnes/sq km of actual carbon that can be sequestered from the air using whatever best plants to do so. 230 (? or is it 250, I forgot). Ok, 250 billion divided half a million equals 5 million sq km of _new soil_ needed. Of course this would take time, and of course more is being added to the air every year, but this seems to be the major way of natural sequestration, given enough clean energy to get the water needed, and more clean energy to power the growing world. Stuff like this motivates me away from the depression of today's reality. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBCbdThIJNE",UCOZHBPIAxydNQOAc07jJVEA,1,UgxNTiax6caL17hQ3vF4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

It's not a selling point at all. Yes, I'm educated. I knew about MSR reactors. Didn't know about Molten Salt energy storage, though it's a pretty straight forward concept. The cost of building is still an issue, that doesn't mean I don't support technology. I do. 110%. But what I don't get is, why deny that CO2 heats the planet. Say ""yes it heats the planet, let's invest in this"". Part of the whole carbon credit trading approach, which has it's drawbacks, but part of the whole point is to encourage the building of solar plants. Denying that the very real man made climate change is happening makes no sense, even if you think you can solve it in 20 years, and I'm not sure it's that simple, but even if you believe that, start by saying it's real and it's a problem that needs to be addressed. Then talk about solutions. But it makes no sense to get mad at people who are saying it's real. Get mad at the people who are denying it, then talk about solutions, but keep in mind, production cost and nimby need to be kept in mind too. I don't think you're right about soil. When a tree grows, 90% of the growth is above ground. Long term bacterial storage in soil? Maybe, but where does the energy come from? It takes energy to get rid of CO2. Plants use photosynthesis for that energy source. What would the soil use? You seem to be missing some very basic chemistry in your calculations. That said, soil sequestering is a method of carbon capture that scientists are exploring. I don't think it's the miracle pill that you imply, but people are looking into it. The thing about scientists is, they want solutions. Some scientists study soil, some study the oceans, some study engineering approaches like the one mentioned in this video. The scientist who solves the riddle will have a shot at a nobel prize, so all scientists in all fields are interested. You seem to imply that you have this idea that nobody else has thought of. That's not how science works. It's nearly impossible today to have an idea that nobody's thought of. Your math (850 billion tons of CO2) is about right, I get 860, but minor point. But your mathematics for carbon storage sounds idealistic. You don't quote a single source, you're just making estimates. And you're ignoring that as plants die, they decompose and the CO2 is returned. Yes, there are some swamps with low oxygen where growth tends to get submerged with little decomposition but you can't just build a sahara desert sized swamp. There's no good way to avoid the natural decay process, nor should you want too, that creates soil and fertilizer and growth. The best way to solve it is to grow trees which have the best and longest carbon storage, which brings us back to the 1 trillion tree estimate that I proposed a few posts up. Your soil sequestering doesn't sound well thought out. Idealistic, not realistic. And there are scientists and scholarly articles on soil sequestering of CO2. It's not like it's an ignored area of research. I find your last paragraph odd. You talk about how hard it would be, and 10 times our current energy production. That's gonzo amounts of money right there. Insane amounts of money. Can we start by saying that man made climate change is real and then look at all the avenues to address it. And can you stop saying that it will be solved in 20 years, because that's very far from certain. I'll add to that, it's not even all that likely. What we might have in 20 years is a better organized plan to address it.

I agree, it's a hard sell! I did some math and I think there is enough deserts in the world to grow all that extra soil. You see, _trees_ are not really the solution, but the soil beneath can be. SOC or soil organic carbon is much higher in some soils than in others. Now, what probably set you off is that I said something about the Sahara, and yes, that's a no no (because of political and religious problems)' However, here's my ""math"" that I just figured out a few days ago (hence my excitement, last night). We need to get the 410 ppm CO2 back down to about 300 ppm. How do we do that? First, how much is that? The atmosphere currently has about 0.041% by volume CO2, (equal to 410 ppm) which corresponds to approximately 3200 gigatons of CO2. Simple math tells us we have to safely sequester 850 gigatons of the CO2 from the air. How do we put all that into the soil? First, how much land is required? SOC or soil organic carbon is only 0.5% in desert soils. But is usually about 2.5% in rather good soil. CO2 weighs more than just the carbon component. The carbon content of CO2 is 12/44. The ""44"" is one carbon at molecular weight of 12 and two oxygen at 2 x 16. Therefore, we can divide the 850 GT of CO2 by the inverse, 3.666 to get a total of 230 GT of actual carbon that needs to be put back into the ground. This is what photosynthesis is for! There's only about 36,000 tons of carbon per sq km at 2.5% SOC, possible to be sequestered. Perhaps much more. 230,000,000,000 tons of excess carbon divided by 36,000 equals almost 6.4 million sq km of desert needed to be irrigated. That's almost 2.47 million sq miles or fully FIFTEEN Californias! However, it's less than the Sahara's 3.55 million sq miles. Now that we know that it's possible to sequester the excess CO2 into the desert ground, we need to find out how much water will be required. I believe, that's the hard part! Too much nuclear, or way too much solar? We'd probably need 10x our present global energy demands just to build everything, desalinate such vast quantities of water, and supply the usual power demands for more developing nations, a greatly expanded space presence, too.

Just to bring things to zero, not reduce the already existing increase but just to bring it to zero, 30 billion tons (metric) is 66 trillion pounds. 50 lbs per tree = 1.32 trillion trees to balance out our CO2 output. Now, maybe the oceans will continue aborbing, so I usually round down to 1 trillion - it's a ballpark estimate, but that's what we need to address our current CO2 footprint, about a trillion trees - which we need to allow to grow to full size because they're only useful when they are growing. That's 15 trees for every man, woman and child on Earth. Do you think we have room for that? Half a continent worth of desert is about right. It's mathematical analysis. If you think that doing that and providing fresh water to do it is easy, I'd like to sell you the Brooklyn bridge. Mathematical analysis is different than guessing. It's different than doom and gloom. Now, I'm not against nuclear reactors, but unless you build a fleet of electric cars so that everybody has one, all Nuclear will do is replace coal and that's a fraction of the problem, not problem solved. Nuclear has a range of issues, like - NOBODY WANTS TO LIVE NEAR ONE. It's called the nimby problem. Also, do we want to build nuclear power plants in 3rd world countries where terrorists can get their hands on nuclear waste. You present it as if it's simple. It's far from simple. Spent Thorium is less of a storage problem than spent Uranium because in theory it burns more completely and it decays faster so it needs to be stored for hundreds not thousands of years, but it still makes one hell of a dirty bomb if the wrong people get their hands on the waste. Not to mention, if we do go MSR - which I'm fine with by the way, you've put the US coal miners out of work and that's been an issue here - look I'm all for it. But your solution is partial and has risks and faces political objections too. I'm just injecting reality into the discussion. It's dumb to say ""build MSR, problem solved"". And I say that as someone who's fine with building more MSR reactors and shutting down the coal industry. I'm 100% OK with that. If we do that, maybe we only need 750 billion trees, not a trillion. :-) Math, logic, understanding the risks and knowing all the facts.

When you say *I think he's saying that sea level rise will be about twice what the normal rise is* it's already twice the ""normal rise"". The danger is that it will go a lot higher than twice and there's geological evidence to back that up. Coastal cities are already flooding more than in the past and it's expected to get worse. Nobody can say when sea level rise will begin to happen rapidly. Right now it's happening twice as fast, but still very slowly. As for *there's not much e can do about it* there's not much we can do about rising temperatures over the next 50 years. That's a given. Because we can't get a good estimate on the timing of rapid sea level rise, it's ignorant to say there's not much we can do about it. It may be within the time-frame that we can address and solve before it's a serious problem. It may not, but to say ""there's nothing we can do about it"" is ignorant. As for the video, your taking the 330 PPM in the year 3000 out of context. He's saying that's based on models with current numbers. He discusses the method of CO2 removal and the cost and even says ""maybe the cost will go down"". You don't know what technology will be available in the year 3000. Will we have solved climate change by then. Probably, but even if new technology does solve it by the year 3000, that won't make his statement at 3:58 false, because that's based on current projections. FInally, I'm not sure what math you did, but unless you cryogenically freeze plants when they are full grown, they will release the CO2 back into the atmosphere when they decay/are eaten. We'd need about 2 Sahara deserts full of trees to address our current man made CO2 problem. Those forests would need to be permanent. That's a LOT of trees and a lot of water.

In the year 3 fucking thousand, we'll have way figured out climate control, if only by harnessing the vast amounts of clean energy (molten salt nuclear, wind, solar and solid state batteries, and of course, fusion, by then) necessary to desalinate enough water to grow plants, the best CO2 sequestering ones, with the necessary compromise of NOT being monoculture, on about 2/3rds of the Sahara alone.

You'll see that sea level largely plateaued nearly 8000 years ago. The argument that ""We're still coming out of an ice age"" is wrong. In fact, the Earth has gotten colder over the last few thousand years, until the recent warming spike that is. Ice is ridiculously difficult to predict but we have geological evidence that it can melt very quickly (geologically speaking that is - over hundreds or a thousand years or so we have geological evidence of significant melt and ocean level rise. Over the last 40 years glacial melt has increased. This is a fact. Very carefully measured by satellite. The rate is still slow, but it's the warming in combination with the increase that's scary. A significant increase may follow. Nobody can say with accuracy when. Unlike air temperature which is a fairly straight forward equation, glacial melt is nearly impossible to predict. All we know is that the melt rate is increasing. Your claim that ""We're still coming out of an ice age"" is ignorant and untrue. We've been out of the ice age for 10,000 years. The ice took another 2000 years to continue to melt after the ice age ended. We're between ice ages now, with an unnatural warming spike. The outcome of that spike on glaciers could be dangerous.

All the carbon from fossil fuels is ancient carbon that's by and large been removed from the carbon cycle. Chemical weathering and carbonates will remove some carbon from atmosphere but at slow but relatively constant rates. This works to take away from the flux gradually. Additionally we have longer term storage in permafrost which traps carbon in ice. Other storage events include mass floods that bury forests, algae burial in the ocean and a variety of other factors that take carbon out of the cycle slowly. However we have added a lot more material into the carbon cycle and as such the new equilibrium points are VERY different now. Carbon sequestered into organic matter is still very active in the carbon cycle, and for the gigs tonnes we produce annually to me removed we are gonna need dense forests like the Amazon over areas the size of Mexico that weren't there before. That's just temporary storage and only counts for our flux. To remove what we put in? If we stopped today producing? You need forests that size for centuries.

Flood basalt events (massive VOlvanic activity releasing billions of tonnes of trapped gases) are one such event. At the rates we emit humans are an anthropogenic basalt event. Unfortunately those events also were followed by intense warming and extinction events.... And they haven't really happened since the solar forcing was 1-2 percent lowerthan today.

""not one Real Estate Insurance company would underwrite new Real Estate purchases in those areas. "" Which areas are you referring to? Insurance is accounting for sea level rise and flooding. This is most apparent in areas that are predicted to have the worst economic impacts like in Florida.

The housing crisis happened because risk management firms were not thinking about the future. This is a normal occurrence. ""The politicians fund scientist to write up the fake dribble, in reports and publications."" You write up fake dribble without politicians funding you.

""This current warming peak, is not as high as the last two and is about the same as one further back."" ""About 50,000 years of warming and then 50,000 years of cooling."" There is no peak. The global temperature continues to climb every year. The peak temperature was 11 thousand years ago when the ice age ended due to the change in solar radiance. That is the common cycle you're referring to and it's been occurring for hundreds of thousands of years caused by Earth's orbit. The Holocene maximum temperature rate is 10x less than the current rate of warming. We were in the phase of entering a glaciation period and have disrupted the current cycle. ""When it was 1,000 ppm, animals were thriving"" ""This one has Co2 at about or slightly higher than 400 ppm"" Animals survive in their natural habitat. When you change that environment at a high rate animals do not survive. Is this basic enough that you can understand?

""The earth has not been warming for 200+ years, it has been warming for about 50,000 years."" It doesn't take 50,000 years for the planet to warm from a glaciation to a thermal maximum. The ice age ended 15 thousand years ago and the Holocene thermal maximum peaked 11 thousand years ago. The warming period happens within a few thousand years. The interglacial optimum ended five thousand years ago. We are in the interglacial and are supposed to be entering an ice age. We've been cooling since 11 thousand years ago. The Earth has been warming since the 1950's at a rate 10x faster than any rate before with a global temperature about to exceed the Holocene maximum. ""weather is changing to start creating the great glaciers and ice sheets again."" Glaciers all over the world are melting. Ice Shelves are breaking apart. Northern sea ice is melting. Sea level is rising and the rate will increase over time.

Since he's the go to man, figured I should repost his reply and mine for honesty's sake. Simon Clark Because it's not that simple - there are both positive and negative feedback loops. For example more CO2 -> warmer, wetter planet -> more photosynthesis from plants -> less CO2. But then at the same time more CO2 -> warmer, wetter planet -> more water vapour absorbing thermal wavelengths of radiation -> warmer planet. There are feedback loops all over the place, hence the need for complicated models! Zacharie Etienne Holy shit a reply from the man himself!! If there are both positive and negative feedback loops - that only means they would either cancel each other out, or they average out into one positive feedback loop, or a negative one. If it's positive or negative, the Earth would've been screwed from the get go regardless of humans. Therefore, when there's no human input, the Earth's CO2 levels must be self correcting , i.e. when CO2 levels are too high, the negative feedback loops have more punch, and when CO2 is too low, the positive feedback loops win over. Only this scenario would create an equilibrium allowing CO2 levels to remain stable over time, any other scenario would have CO2 levels spiral exponentially to either 0 or infinity due to effects of chaos. And if that's the case, then while an additional human input of CO2 will produce a temporary rise in temperature, eventually we will again find a natural equilibrium, because although we've increased the CO2 levels, because we've done that, the net negative feedback loops will become more pronounced, while the net positive feedback loops will diminish, and (as long as human CO2 input is constant), they'll be a point where the loops once again reach equilibrium. I can make an analogy with air resistance vs gravity. As you know, falling objects have air resistance, and the faster the velocity, the more air resistance. Therefore this is an example of a negative feedback loop, because if a falling object momentarily goes faster than the terminal velocity where air resistance and gravity are in equilibrium, then the object slows back down to terminal velocity. Likewise, if the object momentarily goes slower than the terminal velocity, gravity win over the air resistance, creating a positive feedback loop, and making the object speed back to terminal velocity. Any other universe where the object didn't have a positive feedback loop when going to slow AND a negative feedback loop when going to fast, would inevitably result in the object either coming to a complete stop or speeding up indefinitely. Now in this analogy, human input of CO2 is equivalent to reducing the object's surface area. By doing so, you'll have decreased the force of air resistance, making the object fall faster/have a higher terminal velocity.

No reflecting on your past mistakes and a blog full of misinformation that you push onto me to debunk while you sit back and pretend you know what you're talking about. I'm used to it. You probably didn't understand anything I said anyway. I thought I was being straightforward. ""Second, much of the seemingly alarming rise in the last few years is due to an El Nino condition"" This accounted for around 10% of the warming during those few years. ""the rise in the temperature anomaly is not smooth on the few-decade scale. For example, it was actually decreasing from about 1940-1970. As human influences were significant only after about 1950, the graph suggests that the climate is quite capable of varying significantly on its own. "" Temperature is smooth over thousands of years in comparison. There is no temperature rate or natural cause that you can compare this to. ""2c warmer than today"" Northern temperature of the ocean and this was 125000 years ago. Interglacial cycles have no relationship with the current warming. The ""adjacent"" graph is an unrepresentative sample of ocean and land temperatures. "" Isolating and predicting the effects of such a physically small influence in a chaotic, noisy system where we have limited observations is not an easy task. "" CO2 (energy) has been added to the carbon cycle by 30 gigatons every year. The concentrations of energy in the atmosphere have increased by a third since the pre-industrial era. The extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb the additional CO2. The effects of the increased CO2 cause global warming, which causes climate change. ""It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences"" There can never been enough evidence to fill in all of the gaps. There comes a point when you have to accept the scientific truth through a considerable amount of evidence. This evidence has built up over the decades of scrutiny which ended as a consensus among researchers. There is a modest correlation between humans causing the recent warming. Fossil carbon concentrations have increased and the warming is attributed to the greenhouse effect due to less heat escaping into space and more heat returning to Earth. The long list of observations are consistent with AGW. ""projections of future changes are highly uncertain"" Estimates are based on the science, some phenomena being more unpredictable than others. These paragraphs aren't worth the time digging into to find potential falsehoods or exaggerations. I generally know how heat waves, drought, and floods will increase as they have been.

For the last 8000 years the Earth has been steadily cooled from the inter-glacial period as we were entering another ice age. Before the peak inter-glacial temperature 10-8 thousand years ago the temperature was increasing at a rate ten times less than it currently is, and the rate of sea level rise was much higher because of the warming that melted the Northern Ice Sheets. At around this temperature increase the sea level would rise as much as 7.5 meters in 160 years. Now double the rate and the temperature of the inter-glacial peak. The harmful effects of a warming climate is not only an increase in sea level rise. This changes the natural environment with floods, inconsistent climate patterns, invasive species and temperature reconstructing ecosystems and destroying plants and animals natural habitats, and ocean acidity eliminating shell fish from the ocean. There are more uncertain effects such as what might be released underneath the permafrost, releasing pressure from the ice sheets creating volcanic activity, fresh water and higher temperatures disrupting ocean circulation. There are more, but this is all that comes to mind right now. What disturbs me when I read what you have to say Ken, is that you don't know anything and yet you seem to take a position from authority.

If you talk about buses and diesel trains, they pollute as much as a car per passenger. Partly because their utilisation is low when you factor in lines in rural areas and off hours and the fact that they employ people that need vacations and sick leave and go on strikes regularly. Further they generate more tax revenues that are used to pollute even more. There is a reason why public transport is 20 times as expensive per distance unit than driving in your car. Un-piloted autonomous electric trains are the only mass transport that pollutes less than driving in your own car, but building them creates massive CO2 deficits, that takes decades to catch up with. Cycling, even better on an E-bike is the least polluting means of transport, but that is only if you are a vegetarian. A meat eating cyclist emits 85g CO2 / kilometre (almost as much as a car) if you factor in pollution created from farming for the extra food needed to propel you down the bike lane. Remember we out-phased oxes and horses for a reason.The only way to curb CO2 emissions at a scale where it will have an effect great enough to catch up with this exponential growth in CO2 emissions, is to limit human mobility, i.e. work from home, reduce consumption and spending and curb economic growth, even limit the number of children each couple is allowed. The country that does that puts itself a serious serious competitive disadvantage, so no government would ever consider this.

Hurricane Harvey is not unprecedented in the hurricane record. The only unusual thing in the climate record is the 12 year hiatus in landfall hurricanes between Katrina and Harvey. Its never been that long a respite. The amount of rain from Harvey was not unusual; what was unusual was the storm stalled instead of moving as most hurricanes do, and all the rain fell in one location. There is a paper by Hodges and Elsner that finds correlation between solar cycle minima and incidence of land fall hurricanes. The hypothesis is that sunspot activity increases UV light. The increase in UV energy warms the upper atmosphere and a warmer upper atmosphere means a more stable atmosphere with fewer hurricanes. There is evidence we are going into a grand solar minima ... which could really mean more hurricanes. https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.2196 Even UN IPCC AR5 assigns low confidence to any hypothesis that there is an increase in number or intensity of cyclone activity due to an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere.

You are the only one pretending here, Hank. I'd love to see you _finally_ refute my main argument: ""We are heading into a glacial period, CO2 levels will drop naturally by as much as 200 PPM for 100,000+ years. If anything, we (and all other life) will be glad we made things a little bit warmer and richer in CO2 if it even makes a difference at all."" The only time you even got close to addressing this argument is when you talked about the runaway greenhouse effect (that I brought up) and how despite CO2 levels and temperatures being nothing special relative to most of Earth's history, it's _possible_ that the _rate_ of increase _will_ cause runaway greenhouse effect. You pulled it out of your ass and had no idea what you were talking about. You seem to at least be able to understand that that is the only way to refute my argument. You've spent this entire time focusing on my weaker claim about solar activity and through all of our subsequent research it turns out you were wrong about that too lol. Solar activity correlates strongly with temperature. The Modern Maximum (1950-2009) solar activity was higher than the three previous solar maxima, it is likely that our current warming can be _mostly_ attributed to solar activity and only partly attributed to anthropogenic CO2. Just because NASA or NOAA decided not to completely discredit themselves by looking at this, doesn't mean it's not true. BUT, even _if_ it's not, you still have to prove to me that 400 PPM causes runaway greenhouse effect to refute my main argument. I think even you realize that it doesn't. The effects of AGW are exaggerated and not nearly as detrimental as you seem to have thought.

The Modern Maximum refers to the number of sun spots, not a warming period... I really don't think you understand that. ""there is evidence that when glacial periods start, the temperatures fall down to about as cold as they will get almost instantly"" Nope, there is a sharp turnaround and then a slow decline in temperatures. That is backed up by your own graphs. NOTHING about climate is 'almost instant'. The change we are now seeing is faster than any climate change for the past 65 million years. That is not explainable by sunspots. And our temperatures are still very much on the increase. ""Recent high quality measurements show the solar output varies very little with sunspot activity."" I would love to see this. It was in the paper you cited for me, I pointed it out to you several times, you should try actually reading it. I strongly suspect you have tried and simply don't understand it. ""Sunspots are black because the sun is releasing such high energy, that it is outside of our perceptible visible light."" Nope, sunspots are dark because they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. ""It means the sun has high solar activity and it results in a stronger magnetosphere on Earth. Lower numbers of sunspots coincide with weaker solar output and a weaker Earth magnetosphere."" Nope. Increased solar wind and CMEs will compress the Earth's magnetosphere. ""To say that solar output doesn't increase when the sun starts blowing out massive high energy holes in its outer layer just seems a little illogical to me. "" That's probably because you don't understand solar dynamics very well. There are lots of videos on Youtube that explain these things since you don't like to read. ""Not only that but its impact changes as its output changes so it is completely illogical to not include them in their models..."" The models work very well actually, without sunspot information. ""instead, we are seeing a resurgence in ice formation in both the poles and Greenland"" Nope. The 2018 ice levels are still lower. There is a small stretch this month of Arctic ice increase which is more than offset by the increasing loss of Antarctic ice. The claimed increase is denier propaganda. ""If you believe that my information is propaganda (which it is, doesn't mean it's bad), then isn't it logical to assume yours might also just be propaganda?"" Nope. Denier propaganda is deliberately false information (bad) with a political agenda behind it. The attempts to accuse scientists in many different fields in many different countries of some massive conspiracy is ridiculous. It is a childish tactic to simply turn the facts around. The carbon tax was not proposed by scientists nor would they receive the monies. It was proposed by the Clinton administration long after AGW had already been accepted. This accusation is in 'flat-Earth' territory and I now seriously doubt your sincerity. ""...but you are basically trying to claim that our grand solar cycles suddenly stopped after the medieval warming. They did not stop and anthropogenic CO2 can absolutely not account for all of our current warming."" This is ridiculous, I never claimed anything of the sort. The solar cycles have continued as they will for billions of years. I am claiming that there is no demonstrated connection between them and the warming we see. CO2 is not the only factor; water vapor, methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs, deforestation, reduced ice albedo... there are MANY factors. CO2 is the biggest. ""I would say at this point, the burden of proof is on you."" LOL, go ahead and say it, still not true. All you are doing is showing your ignorance of the subject material and unwillingness to bother doing research. Yet you still claim to have figured this out better than the scientists... a-freaking-mazing! ""Every time you ask me to find you peer-reviewed articles I get the sense that you have become stumped."" Nope. It is because I know you will not find it... your claims are wrong. It is to encourage you to do actual research. Googling things like ""double peaking grand solar maximum"" is not research. ""Also, you will realize how stupid it is to make someone read an entire article just to show you that other scientists do indeed think what I think."" I asked for peer reviewed articles to back up your claims... you gave me WUWT <Major facepalm>. This quote of yours borders on one of the most idiotic things I have read in a long time. I am making you learn, you poor fellow! So sorry you think that's stupid! The scientists who wrote the paper (that WUWT is misusing) made no claims what ever in relation to solar cycle effect on climate. They simply came up with a new reconstruction of the sunspot data that can only be estimated (and say they have discovered modes but that is over your head). The paper doesn't help your argument _in the SLIGHTEST._ The grand maximum is already known to be a somewhat rare event, no one disputes that. The sunspot cycles' relation to climate is correlative at best and already demonstrated NOT to be causal. You have provided ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to suggest otherwise.

But yes, that graph is completely accurate. It is certainly not a completely natural warming. It is a combination of a normal warming period (the Modern Maximum) and about 100 ppm of extra CO2. The rate of warming is only unprecedented in the last 23,000 years, while the magnitude is only unprecedented in the last 2,000 if I am remembering correctly. It takes thousands of years for glaciers to form. You are confusing a glacial period with the height of its glaciation called a glacial maximum. Though we won't be a mile under ice for thousands of years, there is evidence that when glacial periods start, the temperatures fall down to about as cold as they will get almost instantly. Though you could accuse me of fear-mongering in the opposite direction I believe it is absolutely warranted. 2. I guess you are right about that one. I was sort of speaking off the cuff when I said that, I don't even think people use language like ""100% correlation."" And yes, apparently me thinking the Maunder Minimum and the Little Ice Age were the same thing is a common misconception. However, it is still controversial whether or not it was the cause. Most scientists think that it was mainly caused by volcanic activity which usually coincides with solar minima. Comparing the first graph and the ""400 years of sunspot observations"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum#Little_Ice_Age it is indeed clear that temperatures started declining before the sun entered a _full_ solar minimum. One thing to note is that temperatures started falling right as soon as the Medieval Warming period peaked and as such correlate with the declining solar activity. The way you make it sound is that temperatures were level right up until they abruptly dropped in 1560, around 50 years before solar activity did the same when in reality, both temperatures and solar activity were declining together as soon as the Medieval Warming peak ended. _""Recent high quality measurements show the solar output varies very little with sunspot activity.""_ I would love to see this. From my understanding, solar output is directly correlated with sunspots. Sunspots are black because the sun is releasing such high energy, that it is outside of our perceptible visible light. It means the sun has high solar activity and it results in a stronger magnetosphere on Earth. Lower numbers of sunspots coincide with weaker solar output and a weaker Earth magnetosphere. To say that solar output doesn't increase when the sun starts blowing out massive high energy holes in its outer layer just seems a little illogical to me. I would be very surprised if you were right about that one. The .1 degree of temperature change still has quite an impact on temperature as well as co2 levels themselves. Not only that but its impact changes as its output changes so it is completely illogical to not include them in their models and as such most of the predictions made about global warming were very, very inaccurate. For instance (I'm not sure which specific model), it was predicted that our ice caps would be almost completely gone by this time when instead, we are seeing a resurgence in ice formation in both the poles and Greenland. The temperature rise is also much less than what was originally predicted, in fact, our temperature rise has slowed down and may even start declining, exactly what they should have predicted had they taken into account solar activity and cloud cover (which are closely related). 3. The Snowball Earth hypothesis is just that, a hypothesis. We have evidence of glaciation at the equator estimated from somewhere before 650 mya. Unless the Earth flipped on its axis, it would have been the largest and most severe extinction event in Earths history. Although, all organism at the time were single-celled microorganisms so there is not much more evidence for it. A runaway greenhouse effect would be needed to override the next glacial period. Otherwise, there is no reason to think we will just continue warming forever. I really don't see how the rate of CO2 emissions matters. We are almost out of oil anyway and CO2 will begin declining (as it always does) as we enter the next solar minimum and on top of that the next glacial period. I wasn't trying to claim that high temperatures will balance out co2. By the time it gets hot enough to evaporate co2, it will be very, very hot indeed. 4. I'm not criticizing the scientists that collected the data and I'm not trying to claim that all scientists are fraudulent. I'm saying that the business, politically oriented board of directors that make the decisions for all of the major science institutions are not only usually not even scientists, but always just agree with the majority in a massive ""circle jerk."" In fact, it is their rule that they have only at least one scientist on their board. They are mostly nonscientists and had nothing to do with collecting the data. I say I am centrist because I actually am. I took the popular political compass test and landed smack dab in the center. Not _near_ the center, literally directly on top of the center. I am centrist. I hold many conservative views as well as liberal, for instance, you know my stance on climate change but I also am ""pro-choice"" and other such things. It actually helps a lot for people to know that I am not their opposing political party. A lot of times, people will just disagree with me because they think I am some looney right-wing conspiracist and they will only start to consider my opinion after knowing I am not the ""enemy."" That is why I told you, I'm glad you are someone who doesn't care. 5. _""the science is out there but they really have no interest in learning it except to look for flaws.""_ I often say this same exact thing to flat-earthers and deniers of evolution. I intentionally tried to use data that both sides accept and use for this very same reason. I also avoided articles from either side that could be interpreted as biased. Yes, I don't have a huge background knowledge of this, neither do you, we are both dependent on whatever the mainstream spoon feeds us. I think everything you have typed you had to research first and everything I'm saying I'm remembering from researching a long time ago. If you believe that my information is propaganda (which it is, doesn't mean it's bad), then isn't it logical to assume yours might also just be propaganda? Don't these institutions and political advocates have billions of dollars to gain off of taxing CO2? There is just as much or more incentive for them to promote AGW as it is for oil corporations to deny it. _""The warming we are now seeing is not related to previous natural warming cycles.""_ So why almost exactly 1,000 years later, right on schedule, we are seeing warming that roughly coincides with a grand solar maximum? I'm not saying it is the sole cause, obviously, the CO2 we have added has a lot to do with it (which is why I'm not a ""denier"") but you are basically trying to claim that our grand solar cycles suddenly _stopped_ after the medieval warming. They did _not_ stop and anthropogenic CO2 can absolutely not account for _all_ of our current warming. Again, you don't need to look at peer-reviewed articles to confirm this. I don't even know if I (or you) would be able to find an article specifically addressing these exact points and I'm not about to scour the internet a second time to show you arguably biased propaganda, I would say at this point, the burden of proof is on you. Show me how anthropogenic CO2 alone was the cause of the Modern Maximum warming, and why the solar activity that coincided with previous warming periods for some reason didn't have anything to do with this specific cycle. All you will find is articles saying that ""since solar activity is on the decline, and temperatures are still rising (despite them slowing down), we can conclude that solar activity isn't the cause of our current warming."" Which you must realize does not at all answer my claim. The subtracted difference in solar activity and temperature compared to the previous warming periods (the Medieval Warming, the Roman Warming, the Minoan Warming) is a small amount and is perfectly explained with a small increase of 100 ppm of CO2. If there were peer-reviewed studies addressing these points then certainly you could find them. Every time you ask me to find you peer-reviewed articles I get the sense that you have become stumped. I did, however, find this article when trying to look up the definition of ""double peaking grand solar maximum"" that you were able to easily find apparently. I am sure you will just write this off as another denier blog. Also, you will realize how stupid it is to make someone read an entire article just to show you that other scientists do indeed think what I think. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/08/06/recent-paper-finds-recent-solar-grand-maximum-was-a-rare-or-even-unique-event-in-3000-years/ It says that the solar activity is not only highest in 1,000 years, but that it is highest in 3,000. Your claim that it has nothing to do with temperature is absolutely ignorant and frankly, ridiculous.",UCgB17M5NEDazswk2krqmp6Q,1,UgxvA3RnMTdkrDj3O5h4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The graph is not stretched out, the y axis (time) is linear and the data sources are available to verify it is accurate. While the current temperatures & CO2 would not be able to prevent another glacial period, you are neglecting the fact that both are increasing at a rate that exceeds the records of natural warming. You are correct that the temperatures of the Jurassic or Cretaceous periods would not fit on that graph but there were also _no people_ alive during those periods and there likely won't be if/when we return to the same global average temperatures. Yes, we would naturally reach a point where the glaciers would return but the build-up of ice is extremely slow. The increasing CO2 and temperatures indicate that we are no where near the return of the glaciers. Current estimates are still thousands of years away just for the cooling to _start_ and another 100,000 years for the glaciers to return. 2. The correlation between solar activity and average global temperatures is *no where near* 100%. Your belief of 'the little ice age was caused by low solar activity' being common knowledge among climatologists is 100% wrong. The Maunder minimum and the little ice age are two different things that should not be equated with an 'or' the way you did; one describes solar activity, the other a climate event affecting mostly the Northern hemisphere. The little ice age started before the Maunder minimum and was NOT a global event (which changes in solar dynamics are) thereby proving that the little ice age was not 'caused by' the lower sunspot activity of the Maunder minimum. The Dalton minimum is more indicative of a correlation but the relationship is not well understood. It is certainly not causal. The term double peak is not confusing at all, the way you are trying to use it is. Since you say it is irrelevant to your argument, I won't waste time on it or explain how solar cycle data for early periods is estimated. I think you misunderstood my question about the models. Many of the current models don't take solar activity into account because it has already been measured to have around a .1 degree temperature variation associated with it. Recent high quality measurements show the solar output varies very little with sunspot activity. The models actually work very well despite not including this solar variation (which further suggests it is not the cause of the current warming). The question I was asking you is: If the warming is being caused mostly by solar cycles, why can't you (or some other amateur climatologists) develop a model based on this solar activity that replicates the temperature data we have available? You are right that THOSE TYPES of models simply don't work and that is more evidence that the warming is not related to solar cycles. By all means, come up with a solar model that does better than the current models and you WILL be taken seriously. 3. The Earth has been through many extinction events, the worst of which was 250 million years ago (not 600). Since it is not one of your points, I will not dwell on it except to say that we are currently in an extinction event and the consensus is that we are causing it. The 'runaway greenhouse effect' is indeed what you are describing but I have never heard a climatologist suggest we are causing that. Most believe it is not even possible for the Earth if ALL carbon were converted to CO2. The term is usually used as a straw argument for the positive feedback system we know about or for media sensationalism to make money. It is this feedback system that causes the swings of natural warming/cooling cycles and the data strongly suggests we are altering that natural cycle. It is not that 400 ppm of CO2 is some magic number which causes it, it is the RATE at which we are pumping it into the atmosphere will push us past a tipping point and cause the positive feedback to take over. Current data suggests this may already be happening. The idea that, as the temperature increases, we will lose our CO2 is fantasy. The scenario you describe is for WATER, not CO2. Yes, in 500M to 1B years, the sun's intensity will have increased enough that the water will 'boil away' from the planet. Carbon Dioxide is more dense than water and will remain in the atmosphere long after the water leaves. All one has to do is look at Venus to see that the ~900 degree surface temps have not boiled away its atmosphere of 95% CO2. The thing that strips gasses from the atmosphere of a planet are solar winds. This has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with AGW. I will limit my critique of your opinion of scientists and the education system except to say that they are the ones collecting the very data you are using to form your argument. You cannot simultaneously smear them as nonobjective and then accept their data which you pick to suit your argument as valid. The simple fact is that the majority of people in the US who refuse to accept the science demonstrating AGW are Tea Party Conservatives. This is not surprising since the Tea Party was primarily the work of the Koch brothers and Americans for Prosperity (their political advocacy group). Koch Industries, a very large petroleum oriented company and the brothers (along with the Heartland Institute, CFACT, and others), invest large sums of money in propaganda to deliberately misinform people about AGW. It is all very well documented if you care to research it. I am also not impressed by your claim of being 'centric.' People can label themselves with whatever they want; the Fox News loving Trump supporters and the Leftist Social Justice Warriors generally both describe themselves as 'centric'. A political label can only be assigned considering your political position relative to the rest of the world. I don't claim to know where you lie on that scale and I don't really care. Your arguments stand or fall based on their own merits. I generally don't bother trying to teach deniers where their arguments have gone wrong any more... the science is out there but they really have no interest in learning it except to look for flaws. It really is a waste of time to get into arguments over it. It is also a waste of time to try to associate unrelated graphs and form a conclusion about what you think the data suggests unless you also research the underlying dynamics. Your posts here indicate to me that you have very little background knowledge in the subjects and you are misunderstanding the stuff you are finding; Caty Marvelous is doing the same thing. I implore you (both of you) to research actual scientific papers (which you clearly aren't doing) and avoid the propaganda if you want to come to a realistic conclusion. You are not doing yourself or anyone any favors by pretending these counter arguments hold equal weight. Your main area of misunderstanding is the time scales of the various factors you are trying to associate. The warming we are now seeing is not related to previous natural warming cycles. This is the most information I will give you on the topic. If you want to dispute it, please do so with actual peer reviewed research rather than more graphs or what you think the raw data indicates. Anything short of this and I will return to simple ridicule which is all people who refuse to look at the science deserve. You have admitted to not understanding some of the things mentioned which I applaud you for.

I very much appreciate it and commend you for your objectivity and respectfulness and I apologize for insulting you so many times. Also, sorry for writing so much, but you asked some big questions that I could have written an entire book on and I had to refrain from typing even more than I did. This is a very complex topic and even many scientists do not fully understand it (and I certainly don't either). 1. Yes, temperatures are currently higher than that of the last warming period, the Medieval Warming period, but not by much, just enough to account for the extra bit of CO2 we have added. It is nowhere near enough to override the next glacial period. That graph is stretched out to exaggerate our current warming. Temperatures during the Jurassic or Cretaceous, for instance, wouldn't even fit on that graph, they would be miles above it. We are currently in an ice age called the Quaternary Glaciation. A ""glacial period"" is not an ice age (a common misconception). Ice ages last tens of millions of years (sometimes hundreds), while glacial periods within ice ages last only around 100,000 years. The interglacials in between them (such as the one we are in now called the Holocene interglacial that started 13,000 years ago) only last around 10-15,000 years. The Quaternary Glaciation only started around 2.5 mya so it is unlikely that it is ending. 2. Yes, we only know for sure what the solar activity is back to about the year 1600, but since then, it has had an almost 100% correlation with temperature, whether that is coldness or warmth. It is common knowledge among climatologists that the Maunder Minumum or the ""little ice age"" was caused by low solar activity. As you can see from the ""400 years of sunspot observations"" graph, the sun has small 11-year cycles, but the graph shows about half of a complete grand solar cycle, showing its low point in 1600 and the high point in 1950. I think there are even larger cycles the sun goes into accounting for the glacial and interglacial periods and ultimately the ice ages but that goes outside of my realm of knowledge. The term ""double peak"" _is_ rather confusing. What I'm only fairly certain it means is that in 1950 there was a single peak, the grand solar maximum of the Modern Maximum, activity began to decrease, but, out of nowhere, there were two consecutive ""peaks"" in 1980 and 1990. This is thought to be unprecedented in solar activity but like you inquired, we can't know for sure. You may want to fact check that as I am not very versed in solar activity but the meaning of the term ""double peak"" is irrelevant to my argument. We approximately know what solar activity was by studying geological indicators on Earth. Temperature and CO2 are easy to detect but I'm not exactly sure how we look for solar activity, but, with the magic of science, we can. That is probably something for you to learn on your own. A lot of the models didn't even take into account solar activity or even cloud cover because it was decided by the mainstream that it has nothing to do with temperature. That is why they were mostly wrong. As you get more into this subject, you will begin to realize just how incompetent and echo-chambered our ""scientists"" can be. 3. I made three claims in my original post: the main one was, basically, we are heading into another glacial period and there is no reason to worry about warming. The second was that solar activity has a much greater impact on temperature than CO2 alone. The third was simply me saying that we are closer to being low on CO2 than having too much of it. Levels below 150 ppm and we are talking of mass extinction on a scale Earth has only seen once before 600 million years ago. I didn't count that as a point though. I haven't made any new points I'm fairly certain. The ugly truth is, despite the fact that they have PhDs, they are about as objective as anyone in these goddamn YT comments lol I know it sounds sad but it is the truth. The courses they take are often taught by professors who know about as much as you do or did. Our entire educational system is corrupt and mostly run by left-wing extremists trying to promote their political narrative. BTW, I am centrist. Runaway greenhouse effect: CO2 causes temperatures to rise, but, rising temperatures also cause a rise in CO2. If CO2 levels become so high, there will be no way of stopping the rise in temperature and this is known as a ""runaway greenhouse effect."" At a certain point, it gets so hot that co2 will start evaporating into space. This is actually how scientists believe Earth will die, by a lack of CO2. In around 600 million years, the sun will become hot enough that it evaporates all of our precious CO2, killing all photosynthetic organisms and everything else with them. 400 ppm is nowhere near enough CO2 to cause runaway greenhouse effect. We know that because CO2 has been much higher in the past and there was no runaway greenhouse effect. You asked some big questions so please kindly let me know if I left something out or didn't give you the answer you were looking for. Also, I _will_ try writing less.

Yes, I realize you were talking about the second graph... you cited that Wikipedia page as a source of information related to the graph (which is what I asked you for). Also on the page was the first graph. I asked you in what way THAT graph supports your position. If your position is supported by information regarding the Medieval warming period then shouldn't the first graph also have relevance? Specifically I am referring to the large temperature spike on the right hand side of that graph. Does that coincide with us entering an ice age and drop in temperatures? Aren't current temperatures well above the Medieval warming? What is the significance of the graph showing us just coming out of the Little Ice Age? Are you aware that some people claim our current warming is a result of the _ending_ of an ice age, not entering a new one? 2 & 4. I _knew_ it was about sunspots!! Ok, so what is a 'Peak' and what is the difference between a peak and a double peak? Everything I have ever read about the double-peak cycles is referring to the sunspot number but you say that is wrong. Also, if they have only been keeping track of sunspots since the 1600's, how can they detect 1000 year cycles? To the best of my knowledge, the earliest sunspot records are only from about 2000 years ago (and they are from unaided observations and not reliable enough to determine the cycles) so how are these 1000 year cycles detected? What is the significance of these 1000 year sunspot cycles... like what effect did the one that you say just passed have on our climate? Why is the most recent warming in stark disagreement with our decreasing solar activity? If the climate is mostly a result of these solar cycles, shouldn't it be fairly easy to produce a climate model which reproduces the recorded history (and reproduces the warming of the past 100 years)? Why have models like that failed? 5. The 'points' I was refuting are the multiple statements you have made in your first posts here, not necessarily the specific claims you are numbering now. Please tell me what you mean by a 'Runaway Greenhouse Effect'. Are you saying this should make the Earth like Venus (who's temperature is often described as a runaway greenhouse)? Are you saying the Earth's climate is dependent mostly on these solar cycles so that a positive feedback of rising CO2 is not possible? And the most important question: If you have figured all this out and accept it as the most reasonable explanation for the data, why have scientists who have studied this for their whole careers dismissed it as insufficient to account for the warming we are experiencing?

This is the last time I am going to hold your hand through my argument, ok? If you still don't get it after this, that is your problem, not mine. 1. As I've already told you, the graph I've already cited off google images is the SECOND ONE DOWN on the Wikipedia page. I'm not talking about the first one. Anyway, that was just to show you it is reliable data. 2. Yes, it is about sunspots. They reflect solar activity and have been kept track of since the 1600s soon after the invention of the telescope. There is a very strong positive correlation between them and temperature, much greater than with CO2. Again, this is my weaker point. 3. I'm only drawing conclusions from what the graphs were directly made to show. My main argument is simply that the next glacial period is approaching and 400 ppm doesn't cause runaway greenhouse effect. It is simply an observation. 4. It doesn't show the entire 1,000-year cycle, the first graph I cited does though. This one just specifically shows the double peaking grand solar maximum of 1950, 1980 and 1990. A grand solar maximum occurs only every 1,000 years. 5. What ""first two points"" are you speaking of? I only made two points. From what I read of your response, you only tried refuting the weaker of the two: that solar activity is mostly responsible for the Modern Maximum warming. You did not refute the approaching glacial period and the fact that 400 ppm does not cause runaway greenhouse effect (which together make a single point).

That specific graph was to back up my claim that temperatures correlate with solar activity and that graph undeniably shows that. It's not a winning argument in itself but to help you further understand the connection. All of the graphs I cited are the exact same deal. How am I interpreting this from a metaphorical tree? It's really hard to find peer-reviewed articles talking about my specific claims and you know it. If you were a real critical thinker you wouldn't need to have me back up perfectly reliable graphs with a team of scientists. If I misinterpreted them, then what are the actual scientific interpretations? Do you even know? I doubt you have ever even seen the data I've shown you. 1. If you scrolled down to the very next graph on the page you will see the exact same graph I've used. It is to show that temperatures do indeed have a much higher correlation with solar activity than they do with CO2. Apparently, I cannot trust you to even examine the links fully that you insisted I provide. This is getting very annoying and I'm about to concede out of exhaustion, which is seemingly your strategy all along. 2. Considering the solar data in that article shows the grand solar maximum of 1950 (and the impressive double peak of 1980 and 1990) that occurs only every 1,000 fucking years (you were idiotically looking at the 11 year cycles lol), isn't it logical to assume that it may be contributing to our current trend? The Medieval warming period was only slightly colder than the Modern Maximum, just enough to account for the 100 or so ppm of CO2 we have added. It directly shows that, yes, CO2 contributes to rising temperatures, but when taking into account the solar activity we see it is negligible at best and that solar activity is responsible for most of the warming. I don't know why I ever trusted you to be able to deduce that. You are clearly incapable of thinking at that level of complexity. 3. I didn't remember the name of each graph you fucking idiot. I just typed in ""solar activity,"" ""temperatures over the last 10,000 years,"" ""Eemian co2 and temperature,"" et cetera. I have argued with professors, yes, PROFESSORS, who were able to accept those universally used and accepted graphs. Somehow, they just aren't good enough for you and when they are, I'm only ""interpreting"" them. When are you going to actually make a refutation? 4. Earth _IS_ dipping down into the next glacial period. A simple glance at the very first graph I cited would tell you that, you incompetent fucking moron. Several other graphs I've cited show that as well, for instance, the graph showing temperature and co2 of the Eemian and the last glacial period. We can expect the same thing for the _next_ glacial period. Make sense? _""You have not explained your argument, all you have done is make baseless assertions that are refuted by your own sources.""_ This is a baseless assertion in itself. You are very dense, aren't you? Tell me, exactly which of my claims is refuted by my own sources? I thought I wasn't allowed to make baseless assertions but you can apparently. So, basically, your entire refutation can be summed up as ""nuh-uh!"" My argument: Earth is already heading into the next glacial period. This is not only shown in multiple graphs I've cited, but it is common sense if you knew anything about Earth's climate history, which you obviously don't. Like the last glacial period coming out of the Eemian interglacial (another graph I've kindly cited for you), CO2 levels will drop by as much as 250 ppm for 100,000+ years. The only argument you have left is that 400ppm causes runaway greenhouse effect. Well, then why didn't it at 2,000 ppm during the Jurassic and Cretaceous (cited), or even 6,000 during the Precambrian supereon (also cited)? The answer is, it doesn't cause runaway greenhouse effect. We will head back into the next glacial period just as we have dozens of times within the Quaternary Glaciation (the ice age we are currently in). If you'd like you can try arguing that point, try proving to me that 400 ppm does actually cause runaway greenhouse effect.

In fact, many of these sources completely refute your statements.

Why don't you tell me how the first graph on that page titled 'Northern hemisphere temperature reconstructions for the past 2,000 years' supports ANY of your claims. After you have satisfactorily done that, we can move on to the next source; ""A review of the solar cycle length estimates"". In that paper, they state: ""Finally, the question whether the increased global temperature on Earth since the 1950s can be caused by changes in the sun is examined. Figure 3 shows a number of standardized solar indices (Rz, SCL, GCR, and the 10.7 cm flux) since 1950, and one feature standing out is the relative constant levels taking into account the 11-year cycle. None of these indices exhibit a clear long-term systematic change."" I would love to hear why you think this paper supports anything you have claimed. I will address the other 'sources' when you actually start backing up your claims.

But fine, I will scour the internet for the specific sites that I first discovered these graphs. Will you actually try refuting them once I do? (I doubt it) -This graph (like all the graphs) was hard to find and I could only find a Wikipedia page that used it. I'm not going to pour through the extensive references to find which one it is. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period -All of these graphs are almost impossible to find a study that references them by typing in their name. I don't know why you expect me to remember each and every study I've seen that does. https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2005GL023621 -Here is NASA's version of the same data I showed you. Notice how their's only goes to 2016 while mine goes to 2018. Again, I don't know what you are getting from all of this https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/ -Why I am having to validate the recorded solar cycles I have no idea but they were also hard to find but I managed to find a NASA associated website that uses graphs based on the same data https://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/scycle.html -Again, I shouldn't need to validate 400 years of sunspot records. I managed to find a Wikipedia page about solar cycles that use it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle I still don't understand why I need to do this for you but you better goddamn appreciate it. -Again, I feel kind of silly scouring the internet for universally used and accepted data. It took me 15 minutes just to find out that Wikipedia is the only one that shows up when I type in ""Earth's temperature history past 500 million years."" I'm not going to spend another 15 minutes trying all different kinds of keywords. The graph alone should have been enough for you. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_temperature_record#Data -I couldn't find the original article where I saw this graph but I remember for certain it was by NOAA, I found another using the same exact data just in a different graph. I don't know how this is supposed to help you understand it. http://www.climatedata.info/proxies/ice-cores/ Also http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/news/news13/greenland-ice-cores-reveal-warm-climate-of-the-past/ It took me about half an hour just to find these. You realize this is completely unnecessary, don't you? -Again, I could not find this graph by simply typing in its name. I was able to find this fairly reputable website that uses it. https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-higher-in-past.htm Though it doesn't even matter whether it's reputable or not, this data has been widely used for decades. There is no reason for you to think it is unreliable. I have no idea why you think that if I've done my homework I should remember the exact URL of each and every article I visited that had the data on them. That's why I just used google images and looked for the graphs themselves. It's almost impossible to find an article that uses a graph just by typing in the name of the graph. Take the temperature record I cited for instance, can you find a temperature record that goes right to 2018? No, you can't. Even NASA only goes to 2016 because they haven't updated their graphs since then (partly because it would go against their narrative, temperatures have started to decline since 2016). Just because it is compelling data doesn't mean NASA or NOAA will stand up and make a study around it. They only do whatever they are paid to do and usually only things that reinforce their narrative. Looking directly at raw data is the most unbiased, objective way of examining the data. If that isn't good enough for you, nothing will be. _""The problem is that your interpretation (using what you say is the exact same data) is contrary to what professionals (who do this as a career) conclude.""_ Really?

The second is a graph of estimated solar activity, it is used everywhere in the context of solar activity. You would have probably seen it before if you looked at studies involving it more often. I simply threw it in there to illustrate the cyclic nature of solar activity. The third is the UAH satellite-based temperature record of the lower atmosphere. This data is used by everyone, NASA, NOAA, independents, EVERYONE. There is even a Wikipedia page about UAH data. This is all accurate and respectable data sets. The fourth is simply actual records of solar activity by the Royal Observatory of Belgium. This data is completely accurate and universally used by scientists.

I would not be surprised if you can't grasp the concepts surrounding the Milankovitch cycles judging from the marked lack of rational logic your comments have revealed thus far. (Go ahead and prove me wrong! Lol you can't!) Let me put it in a way that even you can understand it: The Milankovitch cycles reveal a picture of earth's long term climate. This climate consists of vast cold periods known as Ice ages repeating roughly every 100 thousand years or so. We happen to be in the middle of one such Ice age. Within this vast Ice age there are brief spikes of warm weather known as interglacials, one of which, a particularly mild one, we happen to find ourselves in. Now if you still don't get it, let me spell it out for you: For the average Man on the street who only gets to hear the stories of doom from the alarmist media and from climate change cultists such as yourself it would benefit them tremendously to know about the Milankovitch cycles. It would help them to know that there is ice age behind us and in front and that the interglacial we are is a mild one. If cold is in our future perhaps global warming will help keep the winter at bay for a few more years. Perhaps also the chicken little-sky is falling stories of what will happen if the planet heats up a few degrees won't seem that real if they knew we've experienced much warmer interglacials than what we have today and that this is indisputable given the fossil record. Europe had a flora and fauna much closer to what you see in Africa today. In fact hippos roamed as far north as Scotland. So they'll see that global warming did not precipitate the apocalyptic scenario of the climate alarmists instead lush forests and megafauna covered the planet.

Finally, 400 ppm is nowhere near enough to cause runaway greenhouse effect. For most of Earths history, co2 levels have been around 2,000 ppm. Earth is at all time low co2 levels.

Of those, animal agriculture is about 5% and 35% respectively. Growing crops contributes about 75% of the NOX emissions, with all vehicular transport being 5%. Coal mining is about 8% of Methane, and natural gas and petroleum systems account for 31%. 81% of GHG is CO2, and ~75% of that is electricity, transport and industry. I think it's pretty clear where we should be concentrating. 75% of 81% is a way bigger problem than 75% of 6%. Exchanging fossil fuels for renewables will not only eliminate that 75% of CO2, but also the 39% of Methane from coal and gas/petroleum. So in both cases, energy and transport VASTLY outweigh the emissions from the animal agriculture sector. What I didn't realise is how bad the NOX emissions are from plant agriculture, and this is legitimately something that we could do better, but it definitely does not help to stop eating meat. Having said that, I think we should all eat less meat, and better quality produced with better standards. I pay a premium (20-30% I guess) at a butcher that sources responsibly, they can tell me where all the meat comes from and I can check on those producers. As a bonus, it's FRICKIN' DELICIOUS!!

Ya know, things that cockroaches don't have. So, yeah if we were brought to complete extinction despite all of our cerebral advantages, then yes the outlook would be rather bleak for other species, none of which would even know what the hell is going on let alone have the ability to prepare. Now, you mentioned the dinosaurs -- planets survive asteroid strikes. In fact, asteroid strikes are relatively common in cosmic terms. Rapid artificial pollution is a much worse and far more unnatural problem, for which there is no precedence. Right now humans are setting off a CHAIN REACTION in the atmosphere via rapid artificial pollution, which A) the Earth has never encountered -- slow and gradual climate change, yes, but not extreme adjustments in the course of a century like what we've caused since beginning of the Industrial era, AND B) Is threatening to ruin not only the atmosphere but also the oceans, oxygen levels, temperatures... pretty much everything required for any form of life.

Im not saying it will repair over night but within a few million years how could it not? what damage will continue after our extinction if the ones causint the damage is gone? We know from history that a change in our atmosohere will not terminate life, a change in climate will not terminate life, therefore, climate change cannot possibly terminate life. And if life is not terminated our good friend darwin will ensure that the earth will indeed continue and not deteriorate, as everything that is not dying is growing.

There's an absurd number of factors that keep the entire food chain in existence. Obviously there are species that would outlive us, but an Earth that is so badly damaged as to be inhospitable for humans would likely be on such a severe decline that the extinction of all other species would inevitably follow, whether it be hundred or thousands of years later. It would not just ""bounce back"" as if nothing happened after we've completely ruined the atmosphere, which by the way is the only thing keeping us from looking like every other dead planet. In simpler terms: Any man-made changes that are drastic enough to cause our extinction will probably extinct most if not all other species in time. You should study mini ecosystems and how they work. Basically, you mess up one component and you fu*k the whole thing up. Pretty simple concept. That's where we're at right now. We're messing up the atmosphere, which is THE main component that you can't just slap a band-aid on or do without. You can't just assume it will start fixing itself because we're gone, it will just continue on the same detrimental path that led humans to extinction, which eventually would extinct everything else.

I suspect there would be less overall scepticism towards climate change in general if there was more in-depth information that explains the actual mechanisms that drive it, instead of poorly thought-out metaphors and general nonsense in the way it&#39;s presented to the public. However, I fundamentally disagree with the attitude of technological pessimism that you express at the end of your video. The reality scientists, activists and politicians prefer to ignore is that if industrializing--as well as recently industrialized--nations were to make the switch to renewable energy right now, they would lose their competitive advantage more or less instantly. It&#39;s easy for us, living in the developed word, to pontificate about reductions in emmission: we can afford it. If the LCOE of the various sources of renewable energy do not come down, I suspect we will be looking at another half century or so until we reach peak emmissions.

We both are worried of the same thing, but don´t share same exact thougts. Let´s be respectful. Maybe I didn´t. Sorry again. Let´s imagine an ecosystem in which we have a given sheeps cohort (pray) and a given cohort of wolves (predator). By nature, if population of sheeps grows, let´s say wolves are reduced by any reason so they have a lower number of predators ( it could also happen that any limitation factor could grow -nutrients, N, P...- so sheeps population will grow as well), naturally will appear any kind of dissease in sheeps population which will regulate its population taking it to a lower more stable level. That´s how ecology works, not my opinion. Species will not change their biological nutrition just because they are not ready for that. In that case of a sheep population explosion we could think... oh no! poor grass, it´s going to be taken to extinction by a higher sheeps population... so... why don´t we (sheeps) try to become photosynthetic so we will all survive -sheeps and grass-. (this would be same like humans becoming herbivorous). ""Of course, then try to take some sun bath and we´ll see if we make photosynthesis..."" We, humans, have been going against Nature by fighting against disseases as science improved, between other factors, so our population has grown since industrial revolution. So, we have rised our population because we have manipulated how nature works, but our biology remains the same. We can´t go herbivorous suddenly because we are not ""made"" for that. Also, as you can read under your comments you´ll realize that it is a huge problem human population has grown that much. Then, I ask you. Isn´t it the main problem that we have rised population more than the Earth is able to sustain more than the diet we must have? In my opinion it is a bigger problem westernized humans than cows/meat... By other hand, I think we shouldn´t say 7,000 million people will do this or that, because we should mainly take in mind the number of westernized people, because that is the quantity that is making the most significant changes over the Earth and the rest of the population. Why did I used brain washed expression (sorry again)? Because I see vegan people buying vegan food coming from around the world which has a high footprint, probably higher than eating a local steak. Then I also see some people claiming vegan diet while blaming ""normal"" people assasins, killers of animals, etc... while they take flies, very long drives, etc... and don´t realize they are also killing animals indirectly -probably even more. Just see how Coral Reef is dying-. (please, see also English is not my native language and I can make some expression mistakes). Local feeding (traveling, wearing, buying, etc etc etc) is the way to go. We should reduce population and stay locally. Why is it snob?

Of those, animal agriculture is about 5% and 35% respectively. Growing crops contributes about 75% of the NOX emissions, with all vehicular transport being 5%. Coal mining is about 8% of Methane, and natural gas and petroleum systems account for 31%. 81% of GHG is CO2, and ~75% of that is electricity, transport and industry. I think it's pretty clear where we should be concentrating. 75% of 81% is a way bigger problem than 75% of 6%. Exchanging fossil fuels for renewables will not only eliminate that 75% of CO2, but also the 39% of Methane from coal and gas/petroleum. So in both cases, energy and transport VASTLY outweigh the emissions from the animal agriculture sector. What I didn't realise is how bad the NOX emissions are from plant agriculture, and this is legitimately something that we could do better, but it definitely does not help to stop eating meat. Having said that, I think we should all eat *less* meat, and better quality produced with better standards. I pay a premium (20-30% I guess) at a butcher that sources responsibly, they can tell me where all the meat comes from and I can check on those producers. As a bonus, it's FRICKIN' DELICIOUS!!

People need to realise that our society (regardless of widespread dietary proclivities...) will continue to cause global warming. To change from a carnivorous to herbiferous diet will still require mass industrialisation. Thus, will still generate heat as well as GHG emissions. . The underlying cause being simply TOO MANY PEOPLE. We are heading towards population overshoot. . And *no,* livestock agrigulture, though a serious contributor to atmospheric GHG emissions, is not the largest contributor. That forcing belongs to industrial civilisation and a large chunk of that is the military industrial complex. . The point is so often missed, though Simon did mention it... Global warming is *LOCKED IN* for the forseeable future. So even if, all humans ceased producing CO2 (et al) and turned vegan this evening, it would not make one jot of difference to global warming. This is due to the latent effect of GHG molecules in the atmosphere. . Also, one particular GHG - Methane (CH4), which is yet another sequestered carbon deposit (a fossil fuel...), has been kept sequestered by a relatively stable climatic period (the 18 odd thousand years up to the industrial revoloution...). . CH4 can only be stored under extreme pressure and at sub zero temperatures. Here the CH4 molecules are locked within 'cages' of frozen H2O molecules - ice. These cages are called 'clathrates' or 'hydrates'. They exist naturally all over the planet. Locked up in the sediments of the planet's oceans. Where they remain sequestered by the extreme pressures and sub-zero temperatures that are prevalent at extreme depths of all the major oceans. . However, CH4 clathrates also exist in large quantities in the more shallow regions of our oceans, essentially the continental shelves surrounding each continent. Any release of CH4 from deep clathrate deposits, would not reach the atmosphere in large quantites, due to absorption/assimilation of CH4 in the ocean water column. Whereas clathrates thawing in shallow regions, have less of a water column (a difference, on average of around 14 thousand feet....). Thus more CH4 can and *is* reaching the atmosphere. . Currently, the East Siberian Sea, continental shelf, the region of the Arctic ocean that is directly north of eastern Russia (Siberia) is outgassing methane. This is increasing and is directely related to a warming Arctic ocean. CH4 is also outgassing from the Canadian shelf and of course all across the northern tundra regions (Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia). Here the clathrates that were hitherto locked up in deep permafrost, which of course is now thawing, as part of the retreating cryosphere (the planet's 'icy' regions - Ice Sheets - Greenland, East and West Antarctica - Sub tropical glaciers - Alaska, The Rockies, The Andes, The Alps, The Himalayas, Kamchatkan peninsular and the odd high mountains elsewhere - Sea Ice - Arctic and Antarctica - Permafrost regions - Tundra), all in retreat, due to global warming. . The release of CH4 is of extreme concern and is one of countless ' positive feedback loops' triggered by GW. . CH4 - molecule for molecule is around 100 times more potent as a greehouse gas (GHG) than that of CO2. The concern is that it is estimated that around 500 GIGAtons of CH4 exist in the ESS (East Siberian Shelf) alone... That with the continual increase in Arctice oceanic temperatures, a large outgassing may occur. This is coloquially termed - a 'Clathrate Burp/bomb/gun' event. Such an event, will accelerate the ongoing GW. . None of this was mentioned in this video because CO2 emissions still remain the primary driver for global warming. Also there is a MSM clampdown on information regarding the Arctic CH4 emissions.... But the research is not new and is readily available to anyone who wishes to dig further. . The point is, that global warming is locked in. There is no feasible technology that can mitigate this process. Nor will any personal endeavour make one jot of difference. We started the snowball... Now it is out of control. . Running in paralell to global warming/climate change is the ongoing Sixth Mass Extinction. This too, was triggered by the rise of human civilisation. Given that humans would not readilly agree to curb population, nor reduce or abolish industry - a return to medieval living - Both the MEE VI and global warming will continue apace. . The upshot is - the EXTINCTION of all major species on this planet, which includes all vertebrates and by physical definition - homo sapiens-sapiens. . I have only mentioned TWO vectors here - Global warming due to GHG emissions (CO2/CH4/NO2/H2O) and sequestered carbon release (CH4). The reality is far worse - for there are those countless self-reinforcing feedback loops, as well as other anthropogenic vectors - Radionuclides (nuclear power and weapons...), which is the ionising radiation emtted by the nuclear process and extremely lethal to life... Toxins - plastics, chemicals, pesticides, mineral processing etc... And the ongoing destructive processes - deforestation, mass habitat loss mining and drilling, fracking, dam building, urban growth, the depletion of the planets FINITE resources and of course - fisheries and (MONO)AGRICULTURE... . Not to mention the planet's own natural processes of tectonics, volcanism, ocean circulation etc... In fact the latter is being seriously affected by global warming as the oceans are the primary absorber of CO2, which in turn increases the mass of the oceans and decreases the pH levels - hence that oceans are turning acidic, with subsequent habitat loss and species extinction. The increase in mass, of the oceans, together with the thawing of all land-borne ice - deglaciation - causing higher global sea levels, again resulting in habitat loss and species extinction. . Also Oxygen levels (atmospheric and marine) have decreased over *recent* decades. Anoxic conditions (depleted O2) are not conducive to the continual survival of O2 breathing/processing organisms... . All this is accelerating at a pace that even our science cannot grasp. Last week, a report was published that shows that Antarctica, hitherto regarded as the region of the cryosphere that was the slowest to be shedding ice mass, has overtaken Greenland as being the fastest contributor to rising oceanic sea levels... This can only happen on planet that is undergoing accelerated global warming. . Humans have around fifty years tops. Homo sapiens-sapiens, along with most other species, *will* become extinct before the close of this century. If not far sooner... And no one has mentioned the *wildcard* - war. .

The herbivores mediate nutrient cycling via digestion of cellulose containing materials. so basically plant grows putting out exudates into the soil which contain carbon and facilitate the population growth of microbiota which use soil parent mineral material and photosynthates leached out by the plant via its root system to increase soil carbon. the plants indirectly and directly benefit from this microbial population via the minerals they make bioavailable from unavailable soil parent material (basically weathered down rocks that form sand silt and clay). however the important part Is grasslands which dump an enormous amount of carbon into the soil via aforementioned process when reaching maturity become lignified and the process(carbon cycling) slows down significantly (the plant is worried about seed production for the Next Generation not vegetative growth). enter the herbivores. Herbivores prune down the grassland and predigest the hard to break down cellulose for insects and micro fauna to turn the dung into a stable form of carbon such as Olmec, fulvic or humic acids. This eventually becomes a positive feedback loop and soil carbon begins to build to enormous levels such as what can be seen in the American Bread Basket where the Bison once roamed.",UCZpnmHEpqTiwx6yCIjUePtA,1,Ugww7X4bgjdxGoybNHR4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

Here is why: Earth radiates at peak wavelength of 10 microns which corresponds to 59 degrees F, which is the average temperature of our planet. Most of this radiated energy( about 63 % of the total) is centered about 10 microns and within a couple of microns above and below 10 microns. That means whatever is absorbing the majority of the infrared radiated by Earth should have an peak absorption in the 8- 12 micron bandwidth. CO2 absorbs strongly at 2.7, 4.3, and 15 microns. Most gases including CO2 all absorb in very narrow bands around their peaks, no more than 2 microns on either side of the peak. This means that CO2 is absorbing only very negligible amounts of energy from the Earth. Coupled with that and the fact that Earth is not even close to being a perfect blackbody radiator(a perfect blackbody radiator does not exist in nature). The Earth is at best radiating with an emissivity of ..8 to .9. This means that the radiated energy of the Earth's surface is a smaller percentage of the total infrared held by the surface of the Earth. Furthermore, when CO2 absorbs a photon it vibrates over a period of time in the microsecond time range and then emits a different wavelength that is not in the CO2 absorption band. That photon has less than a 50% chance of being reabsorbed by the Earth since CO2 emits in a solid angle in all directions which includes back into space. What all this boils down to is that 1 molecule of CO2 is absorbing such extremely small amounts infrared that it's vibrations would be completely incapable of heating even a few molecules( say 4-5 molecules) of N2 and O2 around it to a temperature of even a fraction of a degree, let alone the 2500 molecules that surround it.",UCUSq-TyoXHgOAt7swGYSPyw,1,Ugx28fY_bwzw55IBTbZ4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

There is an incredible amount of bullying going on and if you're not part of the majority on issues like this, you're ridiculed without anybody ever taking a look at what it is you have to say.

The issue is that our planet's temperature is rising at an UNPRECEDENTED rate. This rise in temperature has not been seen anywhere else in the Earth's history. Yes, solar radiation and the oceans and water vapor HAVE contributed to the rise in temperature in the past and continue, but the rise that we are seeing in the present is being pushed by SOMETHING ELSE, otherwise our current warming would line up with the warming from centuries and millennia past. CO2 can both contribute to AND is a side effect of global warming. It contributes to global warming by trapping some of the Earth's heat. It's also a side effect because the warmer the Earth gets, the more CO2 in the ground and ice gets released. Also, I've never seen a climate scientist suggest that we get rid of all CO2 on the Earth. The issue is that our level of CO2 is out of balance, because we keep injecting it into the air from the fossil fuels we dug up underneath the ground. If you pump up a closed fish tank full of water, eventually the tank will crack.

Every climate alarmists purposely ignore the impact of solar radiation, the oceans, water vapor and the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This is that same nonsense crap about de-industrializing the planet with renewable energy (which doesn't work) and turning back the clock to 1850. And the most obvious thing alarmists ignore is that CO2 is 100% organic, powered by solar radiation and is NECESSARY FOR LIFE on this planet. Without CO2 - the planet dies.

Deep ice cores from the Antarctic French Dome C station and the Russian Vostok station span some 800,000 years. During that period there have been eight glacial advance and retreat cycles of about 100,000 years each. The cycles are being driven by the Milankovitch forcings of Earth orbital excentricity, wobble, and axial tilt. Those forcings were NOT regulated by atmospheric CO2 concentrations. During the Pleistocene Epoch, atmospheric CO2 averaged about 180ppm during glacial advances and 280ppm during glacial retreats, always lagging the celestial forcings. Now, that trend is being reversed by humans burning millions of years worth of carbon sequestered in the Earth's crust into the atmosphere within the about 250 year span of the Industrial Revolution plus cattle feedlot methane, Arctic tundra melting and sea floor methane clathrate sublimation, and some nitrogen compounds being released into the atmosphere. Sea warming has increased the amount of atmospheric water vapor, itself a potent greenhouse gas. IF you go to my, not for profit, web site www,ciclicoahuila.com you will see side by side images of the Earth showing a relatively clear sky in 1972 and a hazy, carbon polluted, sky in 2017.

Since he's the go to man, figured I should repost his reply and mine for honesty's sake. Simon Clark Because it's not that simple - there are both positive and negative feedback loops. For example more CO2 -> warmer, wetter planet -> more photosynthesis from plants -> less CO2. But then at the same time more CO2 -> warmer, wetter planet -> more water vapour absorbing thermal wavelengths of radiation -> warmer planet. There are feedback loops all over the place, hence the need for complicated models! Zacharie Etienne Holy shit a reply from the man himself!! If there are both positive and negative feedback loops - that only means they would either cancel each other out, or they average out into one positive feedback loop, or a negative one. If it's positive or negative, the Earth would've been screwed from the get go regardless of humans. Therefore, when there's no human input, the Earth's CO2 levels must be self correcting , i.e. when CO2 levels are too high, the negative feedback loops have more punch, and when CO2 is too low, the positive feedback loops win over. Only this scenario would create an equilibrium allowing CO2 levels to remain stable over time, any other scenario would have CO2 levels spiral exponentially to either 0 or infinity due to effects of chaos. And if that's the case, then while an additional human input of CO2 will produce a temporary rise in temperature, eventually we will again find a natural equilibrium, because although we've increased the CO2 levels, because we've done that, the net negative feedback loops will become more pronounced, while the net positive feedback loops will diminish, and (as long as human CO2 input is constant), they'll be a point where the loops once again reach equilibrium. I can make an analogy with air resistance vs gravity. As you know, falling objects have air resistance, and the faster the velocity, the more air resistance. Therefore this is an example of a negative feedback loop, because if a falling object momentarily goes faster than the terminal velocity where air resistance and gravity are in equilibrium, then the object slows back down to terminal velocity. Likewise, if the object momentarily goes slower than the terminal velocity, gravity win over the air resistance, creating a positive feedback loop, and making the object speed back to terminal velocity. Any other universe where the object didn't have a positive feedback loop when going to slow AND a negative feedback loop when going to fast, would inevitably result in the object either coming to a complete stop or speeding up indefinitely. Now in this analogy, human input of CO2 is equivalent to reducing the object's surface area. By doing so, you'll have decreased the force of air resistance, making the object fall faster/have a higher terminal velocity. But the same positive/negative feedback loops apply, so although the object will temporarily fall faster, it will inevitably reach a new terminal velocity again, where the feedback loops cancel out and it's all ok.",UC4ksCts5h9D4kl5cwZ07qcQ,1,Ugx28fY_bwzw55IBTbZ4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

The reason a feedback loop doesn't violate the conservation of energy is because extra CO2 doesn't produce energy, it traps more of the sun's energy. What happens is the suns rays enter our atmosphere, hit the earth and bounce off. But what CO2 does is once the light rays go through, and bounce off the earth, they sort of ""bounce back"" off the CO2 back down to earth, like 2 mirrors facing each other. And the more CO2, the more efficiently the mirrors reflect. So it's not a perpetual motion machine scenario, it's just stopping the Earth from radiating so much of it's energy into space, like an oven, hence the warming.",UC4ksCts5h9D4kl5cwZ07qcQ,1,Ugx28fY_bwzw55IBTbZ4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

All it means is that feedback loop takes very long to go round. But it never stops, and it's gradually speeding up = Inevitable natural doom regardless of humans? So you still haven't explained how CO2 levels could possibly remain stable like they have throughout Earth's history before human pollution, despite the feedback loop of CO2.

Here's my argument: 1) As CO2 levels increase, temperature also increases. 2) As temperature increases, sea temperature increases (duh). 3) As sea temperature increases, CO2 dissolution rates decrease. 4) As CO2 dissolution rates decrease, CO2 levels increase. Do you not see the contradiction here? By that logic, CO2 levels would NEVER be able to decrease. Because as soon as there's an increase for whatever reason, that amplifies the effects and makes it increase MORE and MORE! That means CO2 levels must have been increasing at an exponential rate throughout all of history!!! Or in other words, it'd be impossible for CO2 levels to be ""stable"". It's like if you were to stand a long stick perfectly straight up and let it go, it might stay up for a while, but as soon as it starts to lean even the slightest bit, that will cause it to lean even more, which will make it lean EVEN MORE etc. etc. and so the falling of the stick is IRREVERSIBLE even naturally!",UC4ksCts5h9D4kl5cwZ07qcQ,1,Ugx28fY_bwzw55IBTbZ4AaABAg,dC7A9FHLreI,2018-06-15 10:26:53

CO2 levels were getting close to the critical level of 150 ppm where life ceases to exist ... another million years or so and it would have got there if we hadn't started burning fossil fuels.
