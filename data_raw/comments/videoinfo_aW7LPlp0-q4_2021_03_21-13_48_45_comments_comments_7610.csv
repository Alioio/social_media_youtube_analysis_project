29,UgwgfumaGsnv07NlScd4AaABAg,0.0,1,2020-10-30 01:46:35,Stephen Hall,Bernie switched ground on climate when Biden gave a more realistic overview of the time it would take to reduce fossil fuels to minimal use. Renewables are not sufficiently developed and integrated in the USA yet but nuclear power stations would accelerate the overall time. Cabling from these and from fossil stations is identical and once pure fission stations needed less output because of renewables organisation they could be closed down or gradually converted to thorium reactors -- straight to the same cables.<br />Thorium stations are admittedly complex and expensive to build but savings in maintenance and the bi-products of the technology would make it worthwhile planning the new fission stations for such flexibility.<br />American early thorium experiments were very successful but the materials for what we may call the &#39;plumbing&#39; were yet to be developed.<br />Now they have been and further thorium development has occurred and especially in the last 5 years. <br />These two professional politicians both show poor research knowledge and their party has failed to equip them because it remains stuck in its history of bickering about who cares the most. Virtue signalling without precise planning and streamlining of the Senate merely slows these well-meaning people down and trying a committee based bungled attempt to impeach a sitting president also robbed candidates of credibility at exactly the wrong time.,UCuW7pCsoElXHQie14qTud7w,0,UgwgfumaGsnv07NlScd4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Conditions were by and large not as habitable to humans when it did happen. Remember, humans have only been around for ~200,000 years, whereas the glacial/interglacial cycles have occurred over the span of hundreds of millions of years. Humans have evolved in the lifestyle we're accustomed to precisely because the climate has been relatively stable in the short time humans have existed. You also don't seem to grasp what would happen with climate change. It leads to overall a warmer climate, yes, but worsened extremes as well. Countries with millions upon millions of people live near and on the equator would become extremely inhospitable, and in many ways deadly, to humans. I'd encourage you to read about it. Both sides. I spent a lot of time reading climate deniers' websites, arguments, and videos. Why? Because I wanted to believe them. I wanted to get comfort. But deniers' arguments are all based on half suppositions, taking papers out of context, distorting facts- similar to when you read flat earthers' arguments. Anyone with a little amount of time and effort could systematically dismantle most of the climate deniers' arguments easily. Sometimes it takes a little research to figure out the con game the more sophisticated deniers do. If you're young, disaster may or may not occur by the end of your lifetime. But your kids, and definitely their kids, are in for a freaking doozy of a time. Don't worry though, it's by and large too late and definitely out of the control of anyone like you or me.

Depending on how old you are, you'll see how it plays out in your lifetime. Regardless, there's no hope. The world is too profit driven and divided to come together, but even if they did, it's too late. The climate will continue to warm, and it will continue to worsen. By the way, you don't even have to believe in man made climate change. Just that the climate is changing and getting warmer, which should be obvious to you. You also know the planet always goes into ice age/warming cycles. What makes you think the warming is just going to stop here, where it is now?

If it were then there would be a decrease in entropy and so we can deduce that the radiative forcing greenhouse conjecture is false. <br /> <br />I subsequently proved the first paper on PSI about the “Model Atmosphere” to be riddled with errors in its attempt to claim that all we needed was solar radiation to the surface in order to explain observed temperatures. It is so easy to understand why that is not the case because the Moon’s surface receives about twice as much solar radiation and does not simultaneously lose energy also by evaporation, conduction and convection as does Earth’s surface. The average temperature of the Moon’s surface is below zero Celsius and Earth’s global mean surface temperature would be less than 233K if solar radiation to the surface were the only reason. <br /> <br />So that leaves the world with no valid explanation for the global mean surface temperature of planets like Earth and Venus. <br /> <br />In 2013, after considerable research and thought, I explained what does happen on all planets and moons with atmospheres in my paper “Planetary Core and Surface Temperatures” on which was based my book published in 2014. It will probably take another decade or so before the truth in that paper is widely known and recognised. <br /> <br />The claim of AGW proponents that there would be an isothermal troposphere in the absence of “greenhouse” gases contravenes the Second Law of Thermodynamics as it would not be the state of maximum entropy, having more gravitational potential energy per molecule at higher altitudes and yet the same mean molecular kinetic energy and thus unbalanced energy potentials. Thermodynamic equilibrium is reached when there are no remaining unbalanced energy potentials and so the sum of (KE + PE) is homogeneous over altitude. Thus, since PE varies, so does KE, that is the temperature becomes warmer at the base of the troposphere (where PE is least) without any back radiation needed. All surface temperatures on all planets can be correctly explained based on this, so if back radiation could do extra surface warming then we would all cook. <br /> <br />Now that I have liquid funds in six figures I will by late next year be funding the establishment of a major class action by Australian companies affected financially by the hoax against the CSIRO and national and state governments, using responses to numerous Freedom of Information requests and being the main witness, as I can easily prove climatology claims false.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://whyitsnotco2.com/"">http://whyitsnotco2.com</a>",UCUNPpKTRxBNY2U_n1Mnbljg,0,UgyU_w2o1GNg5soue254AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

It never worked, because while former presidents took their money they also allowed the agrobusiness to ransack southern and eastern Amazon, and turn most of it into cow pastures, bringing white brazilians to colonize the land in replacement of the traditional, indigenous people.

The moderator asks Bernie for specific meassures in his policy to fight climate change. Bernie responds to that by saying that we have to fight climate change and the situation is serious. The concrete meassures he suggests are to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry. He then asks for Biden's position. Biden does in fact bring up Obama, fair enough. Then he talks about how serious he takes the issue, yadda yadda. Then at 2:50 Biden starts listin stuff he wants to do. It's quite a few suggestions. He finishes that at around 4:35. Bernie responds brilliantly: ""All well and good, but nowhere near enough"". Bernie then talks about how we have to act boldly, and how we have to have courage. He says we have to ""take on"" the healthcare industry and the fossil fuel industry. But he doesn't present any actual policy. Wow, great reply Bernie. Then Biden responds by listing more policies he wants to enact. Then, at around 7:00, Bernie says it's not enough. He does suggest we should stop fracking, which I suppose is a policy. Then Biden responds with how he takes it seriously too. Now we´re at 8:49. Bernie once again states how serious the situation is, and lists no policy. Biden responds by listing stuff he has done in the past, and about building high speed rail, to reduce automotive traffic. Then the clip ends.

As the medical experts have been saying, ALL countries are going to be caught short of hospital beds and equipment if the surge happens in a peak. That is why isolation is needed, to lower the peak to a hump in cases. The reason a single payer system works is that it is available to EVERYONE so EVERYONE can be tested and treated in due course. The insurance lobby has government by the balls and is ripping off Americans. This needs to be STOPPED now.

Age shouldn't matter in a Election. Nor should one's gender or sexual orientation, race, religion, none of that should matter. What matters is a candidate who's polices and ideas bring about positive changes. Someone who remains consistent and won't deviate from going forth to achieve and instate those polices for the people. That is leadership. We as voters have to decide on who's polices resonate with us and for the betterment of the Country as well as if that candidate will fight for those policies. Anybody can say this or that but you need a track record and history of fighting for those polices your pushing. If you don't have that how can you be expected to be taken seriously in the people's eyes? Again it's because of those very reason's people are taking him seriously. Look at how the entire DNC and Democratic runners have turned to square against him. You turned to bring down your front-runner after winning Iowa, large win in New Hampshire, and then another large win in Nevada. The reason being is they have Corporate interest and don't really care about the American people. Like really Joe Biden placed 2nd in Nevada, placed 4th in New Hampshire, and again 4th in Iowa. By statistics Pete was the stronger candidate to go against Bernie after the early state primaries. But that didn't happen instead he dropped out to support Joe Biden as did Amy and eventually Yang. They were clearly all promised something in return if Job Biden were to win. The other factor is Media News has set a negative narrative on why Bernie isn't electable when compared to Joe Biden. Joe Biden didn't have any momentum moving forward yet somehow is now the front runner. Really what are the reasons for that? Yet listen to the pair of them. Who has the better track record, better policies, the youth vote and independent voters you'll need to defeat Trump, all those things that'll be needed to win in the Presidential Election. It's the older demographic that is falling prey to the Media New's narratives on why Bernie Sander's isn't electable or the candidate to defeat Donald Trump which just isn't true. You have a situation where this older demographic is supporting a candidate who has advocated for cutting all Social Programs where as with the other he wants to expand it and cover everyone. These are programs that demographic is more heavily dependent upon vs other aged demographics. They simply aren't fact checking and believing what the Media has to say and 30-40+ years ago before the Internet or other means of Media this would've been true. The issue now is Media News gets to present things before nearly everyone else on a massive scale. By doing so they can easily tweak or bend the truth or lies to their liking. That's setting a narrative which is damaging.",UC0XkfjQq09VvH2i7ncmyK0Q,1,Ugygmhpremw8i4MGesh4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Yes Bernie supported some of his ideas like Automation Tax a great policy one I would love to see implemented. The problem is UBI (Universal Basic Income) doesn't fix the Insurance, Medical, Student Loans, or Pharmaceutical issues that are present within this Country. It's why they clashed and banged heads on their ideas. Now yes people will have that $1000 of extra income each month but how long until Insurance, Medical, Pharmaceuticals, or Student Loans increase eliminating the benefits of that extra income? It's the same story over and over these wealthy elites are not satisfied nor will ever be satisfied. Look at how we've thrown 1.7 Trillion into Wallstreet in a attempt to halt the Market from crashing. Didn't even hesitate on that matter and all it did was grant and hour before plummeting again. And now were looking at another 700 Billion beyond the already 1.7 Trillion. Combined your looking at more than what we spent upfront in the Iran War before interest kicks in (some 7 Trillion when all said and done). What Bernie has been advocating for decades is to stop spending on wars, military funding (we're now over 800 billion a year in funding), stop handing out subsidies to the gas/oil companies costing us $20 billion a year, eliminate Insurance Companies profiteering which is killing people, place every American citizen under a Single Payer Insurance plan that protects everyone saving 100's of millions of people money and saving the U.S Government 450 billion dollars a year if not more which would be several Trillion over the span of 10 years as well as saving lives which our current system doesn't do because everyone isn't covered nor do these Companies cover everything, lower prescription drug cost to affordable levels, the list goes on and on. When you stop and look at everything he is fighting and advocating for he deeply cares for the American people of this Country. Look at how many people within the Democratic Primary were running on Progressive ideas some very similar to Bernie's. You didn't have that 20 years ago. His actions of addressing these dire issues is getting people discussing them and they need to be. And again if you think he doesn't care he has gotten people affordable prescription drugs by taking people to Canada to purchase them for substantially less. People who were rationing or didn't have any insulin who'd likely of died or been admitted to the Hospital if they didn't get it. He as of last year talked a man out of killing himself at one of his Rallies. The list of what he has done to try to help people goes on & on. He doesn't change on his policies or beliefs and remains consistent. Even after suffering a minor heart attack having to have stints put in he had returned to campaign and is still fighting for Presidency. If he didn't care he could've just thrown in the towel then and there and said I don't feel healthy enough or well enough to carry on. Nobody would've faulted him for that. Yet he is still fighting. If these are the signs of a corrupt man who cares more about his image than facts or actually helping people with real world changing ideas that aren't even new at that I don't know what is. He's given numerous facts time and time again on many of his policies that other Nations and Countries around the world has successfully been using for Decades with success.

This is not accurate. 1. The USA has had two commercial LWBR with Thorium Cores at Ft Vrain and Shippingport which present many of the same meltdown risks as conventional reactors. 2. The USA and UK tested nuclear weapons from Uranium 233 in the 1950-1960s and India replicated the process and tests in the 1980s. Uranium 233 is the fissile fuel made from Thorium 232 through a process called breeding. Breeding: Th-232 + 1n -> Th-233 (decay) -> Pa-233 (decay) -> U-233 What Yang is likely referring to is a very specific reactor that is not called a thorium reactor. It’s called a LFTR, which stands for Liquid Flouride Thorium Reactor. This reactor belongs to the MSR or Molten Salt Reactor family. The difference between a LFTR and a BWR or PWR is not that it uses Thorium. The massive differences are: 1. LFTRs do not use water coolant - they use fluoride compounds - LFTR coolants have much much higher boiling and freezing points than water. - LFTR fuel is dissolved in its coolant and run as a liquid 2. LFTRs do not use solid fuel 3. LFTRs do not use fuel rods 4. LFTRs operate at much higher temperatures 5. LFTRs do not operate in high pressure (except for specific sections of the reactor core) What Yang is primarily talking about from a safety standpoint has far more to do with the coolant used in a reactor and the operational procedures of the reactor than using Thorium. For example other MSRs have similar safety risks as LFTRs, but don’t use Thorium such as IMSR, MCFR, MSFR, MSAHTR.",UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA,1,UgzRljiRxBvE_lrQTGt4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

I guess politicians and most Americans just have no idea what actually goes on in this industry. You look at Sanders plan and there are part that make zero management sense. Why on earth is it acceptable for TVA to manage renewables but not NPPD? One of these actually currently manages and owns way more solar and wind than the other and it’s NOT TVA. Yet under the GND TVA gains more ownership. WTF????!!! They are BOTH public entities... Wtf is the benefit having federal entities with low to zero experience take over from mature public utilities?

No data was allowed to be published. <br /> <br />While a few infection cases have been reported in December 2019, the local government affirmed in the media that the virus wouldn’t have human-to-human transmission and that the virus was “preventable and controllable.” <br /> <br />Eight doctors who shared information about the virus with their friends on social media were arrested on January 1, 2020 and charged with “spreading rumors.” Dr. Li Wenliang, one of the whistleblowers, later contracted the deadly virus and passed away on February 6, at the age of 34. <br /> <br />Despite all the early reported cases, several large gatherings still took place in Wuhan in January 2020, including the People’s Congress meeting, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, as well as a potluck party with over 40,000 families in attendance. <br /> <br />When Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, finally confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus on January 20, 2020, the virus had already spread all over the country by people traveling for the Chinese New Year holiday.",UCY3FA0ozQCdu3AORGXdFMvw,0,UgyD1TQqTpaCRkuiJK14AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Honestly the biggest thing right off the bat - it has zero data of any kind for infrastructure. That is absurd. This is an extremely technical industry that requires someone to have some understanding of the scale of systems used in this country. To just say we are going to throw $1.5 trillion at the problem and complete it in 10 years without any information describing capacity additions, VRE concentration, loading system, grid adjustments, storage capacity - it comes off as incredibly sketchy. *Especially when you consider the fact that $1.5 trillion over 10 years is CRAZY LOW for infrastructure spending in the USA compared to pretty much every engineering analysis report.* I mean how do you even calculate the cost of infrastructure without knowing the quantity or type that’s going to be built? Additionally I have major issues where he is planning for federal agencies to gain control of system that they are fundamentally not designed nor have ever managed in their history. So in the Sanders GND he states that PMA- Power Marketing Administration will own and manage all renewable generation under the GND. This is incredibly bizzare. PMAs were created in the early 1900s in the USA to sell power to farming communities near federal dams that would generate excess electricty when water was released in irrigation seasons. The electricty was sold at the lowest market price so as to not create increased economic turmoil for lower income communities (This is important and ill get back to it). Later in the 1930s the markets for sold power were extended to all nearby utilities of federal dams so as to provide below market energy and ramp up the growth and profit for the electrical industry in the New Deal. How do PMAs sell electricity at the lowest market or below market energy prices? Because they receive zero interest loans from the US treasury. Now why does the US treasury do this? Because the assets receiving the loans have consistent high supply, high operating capacity and high consistent production, therefore posing low risk for beneficial investment. The three characteristics above exist ONLY for hydroelectric. They do not exist for solar nor wind, which is in part why PMAs have never owned nor managed solar and wind. Yet under Sanders GND not only will they suddenly somehow start selling this energy - they have the sole ownership of all solar and wind production. I have no idea how Sanders thinks this is a good idea... Why on earth give sole ownership of likely the majority share of energy generation to a federal entity with zero experience managing it, instead of allowing public and private utilities that currently manage it to continue to do so at an increased rate of production?",UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA,1,UgxwTl3JMeJ2W8HOA1t4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

The thing is, I’m barely scratching the surface. This is the first election cycle that some higher education energy topics have been brought up, which is fantastic, but it’s incredibly bs that a lot of people (particularly progressives) have all of sudden taken a very specific side on energy policy, without really understanding what they are advocating for especially at scale. To think that we could install solar energy on every living sole’s home in the USA - that’s a full 7.5kW hr array on some 160 million + buildings. That alone in 10 years is a massive feat, and yet we would likely be generating about 1/3 of the Total US Electricity Generation. That’s crazy. Our scale of development in energy is almost incomprehensible and incomparable to any country. Our current solar industry, which lags behind China and makes up less than 1% of this country, produces more energy than the production of 160 countries!

I certainly care, and even though I know a lot more than a lot of people I would not say I’m an expert. This is why in my last comment I’ve given you 46 sources from published studies on the subject. The first 14 of which are plans on how to fix the crisis both from the position of 100% Renewable and from Sustainable (which is the camp I support). *I understand most media outlets don’t want to talk about scientific sources, because they are long, sometimes boring and sometimes very technical. However if we want to truly solve this thing we need the plan to be based around science and engineering not whatever platitude is going to get a candidate elected. ** I have additional sources of information or if you are interested in a particular topic I may have something to provide you with. If not I’d recommend looking the subject on Google Scholar, Research Gate or Science Direct Mediums. Most of the sources I’ve provided do not have paywalls but you may run into this problem with some sources you find. I’d also heavily advocate that you watch seminars from US National Labs as they provide extremely good information on these topics in many cases a laymen’s explanation or educational setting. Additionally US National Labs have the technology to run reports at scale whereas other institutions don’t exactly have the ability to run the efficiency losses for the entire power grid that spans 700,000 miles.

What is the benefit of restricting renewable energy ownership only to the PMAs, Bureau of Reclamation and TVA? PMAs have never owned anything besides hydro. BC have never owned any generating assets. TVA primarily owns fossil fuels and hydro. You don’t like private utilities? Fine, I think that’s a poor decision, but even still why not provide financial incentives to any of the 160+ PUBLIC UTILITIES in this country to either continue developing renewable growth or begin transitioning to more renewables?! There are current public and even * gasp * private utilities that currently manage and own more solar and wind generation than all three of these federal entities combined...",UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA,1,Ugz6GpglMADn5Bl3ZLR4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Literally zero scientific studies use a 10 year timeframe, so where on earth did that timeframe come from? He even has the balls to claim that the IPCC supports his plan for 100% by 2030. Not only does the 2018 IPCC Special Report on CO2 emissions not support 100% renewable by 2030 - it doesn’t even support 100% renewable on any timeframe... And the IPCC report literally calls for an increase in nuclear and CCS technologies through 2050. Sanders GND does the complete opposite and states that these technologies will be removed. I guess Sanders team never actually read that report... Furthermore he has provisions in his plan that completely undermine the current management structure of the US Department of Energy. For example he states that all PMAs will own transmission, all renewable generating assets and manage a wholesale electricity market including the additional one he will insert for the remaining 17 states. A few issues: 1. Not all PMAs own transmission. SEPA for example does not own, build or manage any transmission lines. 2. PMAs solely own federal hydroelectric dams. They are not designed or have any experience owning and managing solar and wind farms or storage facilities other than hydro. 3. There already exists a wholesale electricity market for the remaining 17 states that are currently not covered by a PMA. This market is operated by MISO, NYISO, OEISO, NBISO and PJM Interconnection. These are Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) that in addition to managing this market manage the Eastern Interconnection as part of the North American Electrical Grid. RTOs and ISOs report to FERC - that’s the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, who is literally never talked about in his entire GND. Like how on earth do you even do that? Likely the single most important (or at least top 3) government agency for energy never talked in an energy policy!!! How do you do that?!!

Media News is setting the Narrative on making it seem Joe Biden is more Electable and he isn't. Look at Bernie was in a Media Blackout early on through the Democratic Primaries. He wasn't hardly shown or spoken about even though he was consistently polling 2nd or 3rd place until he won Iowa & New Hampshire. Even after that the coverage he got was directed negatively at him. Such as well his percentages were significantly less than during 2016. Well of course they were. Look at how many more people were running in 2020 as opposed to 2106. When you have more people pushing different policies it divides those votes up. So if anything he did a much better job as opposed to 2016 as a result. Or you could look at them saying look at his narrow lead. If you take so & so's percentages he's trailing behind. So his lead really isn't that much. It's whatever Media News can use or spin negatively to set the narrative and people are believing it. What has to happen is we need a strong Media presence that'll do fact checking with absolute accuracy. A group of moderators who'll challenge and fact check what's being said and present those findings to the American people. We need a presence that'll hold people accountable and in check. Like during the debates we should have moderators fact checking. Any one of the moderators during this Debate could've fact checked Joe Biden on advocating about cutting all Social Programs and not just Social Security. All I'm saying is don't expect Media News to cover this or reveal Job Biden's pathological lies. These are Corporate entities who's higher ups wish to protect their investments and wealth. The only way they'll cover it is if we the American people/viewers demand it of them which we shouldn't have to do. We all have to unfortunately be the ones to bring this out into the open and get it viral attention that can't be ignored or covered up. We have to start spreading the word to people, sharing the evidence and clips all over social media, really get involved. Because if we don't they are going to get away with this just as they always have which is unacceptable.",UC0XkfjQq09VvH2i7ncmyK0Q,1,Ugx6t8YiD3vRaP1jlWh4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

I have a decent paying job, raised my son on my own and have had a lot of hard-working construction type jobs in my younger years. I think that you're the one living in a fairy tale land where things apparently never change. You want to read the same story OVER and OVER and OVER again. Some changes suck and are hard to deal with and some better society as a whole. NOT trusting the government I understand but the current state of the country is not sustainable and something needs to change! Some people thought Trump would change it. I think he made it worse. The status quo certainly isn't working. Look back to when the country was doing well, people could afford housing, could pay off student debt, weren't drowning in medical bills. What type of government existed then? It was a government that was still divided but had some decorum and actually worked TOGETHER to solve problems. The rich were certainly taxed at a higher percentage than they are now and the economic inequality was nowhere near what it is now. All this information is easily searchable online. Today there is far too much corruption and greed in politics ON BOTH SIDES and in the corporate world. Money doesn't make the world go round ... PEOPLE DO! Countries need to invest in their people and, in turn, will have a much happier and productive society. A few of the wealthy are just starting to figure this out now and some companies are as well. But the majority are just greedy pricks allowing the ones at the top and the shareholders to reap the benefits while the remainder are basically just slave labor. With unfortunately not many places to go due to unemployment and the all too common previously mentioned greed aspect. Do you not realize that those in power WANT us divided? If we're fighting amongst ourselves we won't band together and DEMAND that they do their job properly. So when people say 'It's all the other side's fault' then those people are just giving them what they want.",UCU-cVEK8i18XW6U0JKDq1Iw,1,Ugyq1tToc8ohAtPMJ7Z4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

You're the one rambling on like an immature angry little prick. Are you even trying to stay on topic? Because it just seems like you constantly want to bitch and degrade people which is generally what immature people do when they get upset. Y'know ... kind of like Trump! And speaking about self-centered morons that only look out for themselves the man running the country has been given all he's got. He certainly didn't earn it or give a crap about anybody along the way. What a great role model ... stiffing his employees, stealing from charities, belittling anybody that doesn't agree with him just to mention a small sampling of his inadequacies.

You need fuel , ignition an air for combustion for flight.' Well a quick Google search tells me otherwise. Not big commercial flights but smaller passenger flights are definitely in our near future. https://mashable.com/feature/electric-airplanes-future-flight/ https://theconversation.com/electric-planes-are-here-but-they-wont-solve-flyings-co-problem-125900 So while there are certainly hurdles to overcome it seems there are several currently in development. As you mentioned the initial thrust would be one of the main issues. Perhaps fuel for thrust switching to electric for flight would be more reasonable. From the first article it seems that large commercial flights are likely 20 years away. 'Looking at this more realistically, a true electric passenger flight taking a plane-full of passengers from New York to London is 20 years off. And that’s being generous.' However the other article states that smaller flights might only be a few years away. 'It is possible for small aircraft to be powered by electricity. In fact several companies are already developing small electric aircraft and they could come on the market within the next few years.' So it seems that there WILL be electric planes and some possibly sooner than I expected.",UCU-cVEK8i18XW6U0JKDq1Iw,1,Ugyq1tToc8ohAtPMJ7Z4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Do I think all Republicans are MORONS? NO ... but there sure are a lot of them as I can tell by your ignorant responses to people. Do I think all Democrats are smart? No way! This whole US vs THEM bullshit generally shows me the mentality of somebody before I even read what they type. Just because I don't agree with ALL Republican policy doesn't mean that I can't agree on certain aspects or ideas. And that's the way it USED to be but unfortunately it's getting further divided every day due to people like you. At what point did I say I was smart enough to design a new energy source or that it would be easy? Oh ... that's right I DIDN'T. I have a lot of ideas but I'm certainly no engineer. But instead of discussing ideas to try to FIX problems or make the world a bit safer/healthier mouthpieces like you really enjoy spouting your negative crap about 'THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE!'

And because you were a mechanic you think you know that there will NEVER be electric planes? WOW - No room for technology in that field now I guess. This might just blow your mind but here's a tidbit of info. Not all rich people have been great innovators of products and technology. And conversely, not all of those that have made great strides in innovation are wealthy. And generally the people that actually HAVE the knowledge and/or do the work to create all these things that we enjoy aren't' the wealthy ones.

The cost for automobile and truck manufacturing, have you seen the price of hybrids let alone full electric. Hello Tesla. And the cost to replace batteries, $2700 in a Prius, tell Joe America about that. And the fact that renewable energy is also hard on the environment in the form of production for batteries.

Whereas ""Biden"" is how they market his campaign. People just go with what is advertised as it's what they know is normal. Biden vs Bernie also has a good ring to it so media will use that more than the others. Going with Bernie and not Sanders is a good choice from a campaign perspective as it's friendlier as it's a first name, friendly is what you want for a more left wing campaign. It also sounds more punchy as it starts with a hard consonant. Sanders is pretty common surname and most importantly has no hard consonants so it's not punchy at all. I imagine they didn't choose Joe for a similar reason, although it may have been a clever move to play into the whole working Joe shtick. There's no enforced rules on which name you market so this will always happen. Look at Barrack Obama, that's a punchy name that's fun to say, same with Donald Trump, George Bush, it's small things that change people's view at the first impression. Ronald Raegan - that's some good alliteration.

Life will continue for sure, just not in the way you think it will. Humans and most animals on earth right now can only survive comfortably at very specific conditions if you compare earth to other planets in the universe. How do you want future generations of humans to live before we die off? Should they suffer as they are forced to move to higher ground due to rising sea levels and the increasing toxicity of the ocean, not to mention the constant heating of the earth’s surface due to greenhouse gases, or would you like the prospect of humans living on for thousands of years while discovering technologies and science unknown to us now? I’m not crying and whining about it, I’m thinking ahead and I’m worrying about the future. I don’t care about the death of the universe or the supernova of our sun. Those things might be inevitable, but not one human will live to experience either of those events.

The reason why I believe Bernie would be a better opponent for trump because then it would be the working class for vs the 1%, im no mathematician but last time I checked 99% is much more than 1%. Biden is just a starving poor mans Obama. We need a strong candidate vs trump, It is honestly beyond me that Biden is ahead of Bernie, Bernie is a man of class. America needs a change, people say his ideas are radical and instead people just go with the safe option, well last time I checked the safe option didn&#39;t work in 2016. Take the risk it will benefit you more in the end, And even if you are an older citizen and do not agree with Bernie, think about the future generations for example your kids and grand kids they will be much better off with Bernie. Think about your kid just turning 18 and getting his first job, don&#39;t you want him or her to be earning the highest wage possible? Many people in the US don&#39;t go to college because it is &quot;too expensive&quot; Well guess what 60 y/os with Bernie your grandchild can get a free public college tuition! THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY! And also how does Biden get so much black support?, there are literally videos on the Internet of him wanting to pass a racist bill, but of course the news will not show it because it is controlled by the 1% and they don&#39;t want to hurt their chances. My mom has a friend who one time her jaw hurt so much so she went to the ER and guess what, she got a one single pill to reduce her pain and it cost her 6000 fucking dollars, these big industries like the pharmaceutical industry are a bunch of jokes, and with Biden almost everything will stay the same! With the same thing, some people will still have to work 3 jobs just to get by, now do you really want to come home at 9 o clock and have your back all messed up and whlle being tired?.

They concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed, such as melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers, might create problems far greater than those they solve. But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections or future food supplies. &quot;The Cooling World - Newsweek - 1975&quot;<br /><br />Oh goody!

But just a couple things for now:<br /><br />(1) To anybody taking it for granted that Joe Biden would beat Trump...sorry, he&#39;d get his CLOCK CLEANED by Trump because too many people (myself included) have finally decided we want someone who actually represents us, instead of their big money donors, and we&#39;re not settling for the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; anymore. But Joe Biden thinks every voter is a baby-boomer or older so he misses this stuff. <br /><br />(2) Opinions aside, Joe Biden told at least two egregious lies last night: (a) when he repeatedly denied trying to cut social security, that goes against his decades-long record of, wouldn&#39;t you know it, trying to cut social security!!! :) Here&#39;s just one of many on-point clips: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF6Sk0aoGpo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF6Sk0aoGpo</a>. (b) When Joe Biden claimed that the 2005 bankruptcy bill that he spearheaded didn&#39;t make private student loans non-dischargeable, that was also a lie. I frankly don&#39;t know what he&#39;s even saying, here, but that was EXACTLY what the bill did and there&#39;s just nothing else to say about it. Let me put it this way: this lie is literally so opposite of the truth that it would be like saying the First Amendment didn&#39;t create free speech, the Bankruptcy Code didn&#39;t create bankruptcy, etc. This man is just VERY comfortable lying. <br /><br />Folks, again, I have no illusions that I&#39;m changing the world, here, but Bernie Sanders is by far the better candidate and the day this country wakes up and gives Progressive policies a chance, the American middle class will rise up again as it did during the FDR years (which, wouldn&#39;t you know it, was the last time Progressive policies were mainstream in this country). But if the public keeps buying the for-profit media hype and enabling bought-and-paid-for corporate hacks like Joe Biden, the fate of the American middle class will continue to get worse indefinitely.

They did not know it would be co2, but the plan they came up with was to come up with some ecological disaster that was so far in the future that we would not see the evidence of it, but if we did not do everything in our power to stop it, it would kill the grand kids. That is precisely what they are claiming that co2 caused warming will do. Now look at what they are trying to do. 1) make us stop using fossil fuels now (make it illegal) and force us to drive only electric cars which do not have the capacity to get the majority around meaning we will be dependent on mass transit. This means most of us will have to spend all day getting from and to our jobs or we will have to find jobs close to home, taking any job no matter how bad the pay. 2) They want to make choices of what kind of food we eat. When they declare a climate emergency, everything will be related to climate. They can take over soda companies and then decide its not good for the climate to have so many choices of sodas and reduce the choices so that we do not have to ""waste so much energy moving them around"". 3) They want to decide if you have a/c. IF it isnt life and death, they can decide you can just open your window. I can go on, but all you have to do is look at their websites and see all the choices you will lose.

Death is imminent from the moment of birth or even before birth. It may come inside the womb, one year old 40 years old 90 years old. Nothing will stop it. So whatever success may be achieved it is ultimately doomed to fail. Everything that has been, that is or will be is tumbling towards judgement. We are but wisps of smoke. Here today, gone tomorrow. Great proclamations are made. Great discoveries are unearthed or witnessed in the heavens. But they&#39;ve always been there. We were created from the earth. And everything we created was already here. In the elements of the earth. We are on a planet moving 63,000 mph through space within a spiraling galaxy moving a million mph through space !!!! The chances of DNA coming together exactly as it does to make us is 1 × 10 to the 24th power. That&#39;s beyond comprehension. That&#39;s impossible without a Creator. This dimension of time we exist in is winding to a conclusion. It doesn&#39;t matter what we believe. What is, is. It&#39;s in the air. It&#39;s been foretold. And whether or not you believe it doesn&#39;t matter. It will happen. It&#39;s happening. It&#39;s been happening from the beginning. One thousand years, one million years, one billion years is as one day to God. Time has no hold on Him who created it. Flesh is bound by its mortality. Spirit is immortal. Only by faith does the spirit in mankind awaken. Without it we&#39;ll remain blind. Trapped in the moment. Leaving the past behind with each passing step or heartbeat and only glimpsing the future before it becomes the present then moves away to the past. Every single success or failure is therefore temporary. The only thing thereby that matters is the faith in the One in control and the hope of His blessed return. Which has always been a certainty. No matter what mankind thinks.",UC5oM1NWo72GNZTmc3mGyeZQ,0,UgwLSuf2Uu9pm-9Osnt4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Taxes on those making over 500k are 37% (or were in 2018) and Trump has certainly not raised them. Taxing the rich and more importantly corporations brings in the money necessary to pay for necessities that help everyone (schools, roads, medicare, etc.). In Canada the average tax rate for those making 500k is 46.67% and the marginal tax rate is 53.53%. And they are far from a failing economy. In fact in a lot of areas they enjoy a higher standard of living, especially the working and middle classes who don't have to risk bankruptcy to get medical care. Also, a quick google search shows that the top marginal tax rate in 1960 was 91%, which applied to income over $200,000 (for single filers) or $400,000 (for married filers) – thresholds which correspond to approximately $1.5 million and $3 million, respectively, in today's dollars. None of what i'm saying even comes close to saying that everyone would be making the same amount. Not even CLOSE. but i love how you keep pulling bullshit out of your ass. In total, the tax burden on people making minimum wage is SIGNIFICANTLY larger than on the top 1%, who basically pay none when you account for the tricks they use (see how Trump used ""loses"" to avoid taxes) and tax dodging practices (like the ones exposed in the Paradise Papers.

The New Deal programs created jobs and provided financial support for the unemployed, the young, and the elderly, as well as adding safeguards and constraints to the banking industry and monetary system.<br /><br />Mostly enacted during the first term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt between 1933 and 1938, the New Deal was implemented through legislation enacted by Congress and presidential executive orders. The programs addressed what historians call the “3 Rs” of dealing with the depression, Relief, Recovery, and Reform—relief for the poor and jobless, recovery of the economy, and reform of the nation’s financial system to safeguard against future depressions.<br /><br />The Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 to 1939, was the largest and most significant economic depression to affect both the United States and all Western countries. The stock market crash on October 29, 1929, is infamously known as Black Tuesday and was the worst stock market decline in the history of the United States. Heavy speculation during the rising economy of the 1920s combined with widespread buying on margin (borrowing a large percentage of the cost of investment) were factors in the crash. It marked the beginning of the Great Depression.<br /><br />ThoughtCo.<br />By Martin Kelly<br />Updated October 24, 2019",UCbC4dtTbs_PG-r-CQFXTtJA,0,Ugw9D0PSuCjRQezrvYF4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

The continuous bombardment of information about this disease is bound to have inconsistencies—outdated or incorrect reports of numbers of positive, negative and inconclusive test results; the same about the numbers of deaths; and fear-laden speculation about what may be ahead.<br /><br />With innumerable inner city, in-country and international travelers, a contagious disease naturally follows, thus it was not unexpected that the virus would spread far beyond China. Yet, more damaging to the society than this illness are the fear being generated about it and the finger-pointing at Chinese people wherever they are living.<br /><br />Yes, it can be said that fear is “amplified by extreme measures” such as canceling major and local events and airline flights, closing schools, mass quarantining, and testing everyone who may have been exposed to individuals who later are diagnosed with the virus. Those precautions are sensible to curtail the spread of the disease to the extent possible and should allay anxiety, not add to it.<br /><br />It is helpful that healthcare professionals are emphasizing there is no reason for panic. They explain the simple measures that help prevent getting the disease, whose symptoms are generally mild; that people who have health issues are the most susceptible; and compared to the numbers that have contracted the virus, the number of deaths is very low.<br /><br />By no means are we downplaying, much less overlooking, the abundant emotions involved by asking this: Where is similar concern about the many, many thousands of deaths every day due to starvation, warring, domestic and random violence, vehicle crashes, suicide or chronic diseases due to substandard living conditions?<br /><br />From our vantage point, it appears that the coronavirus’s disruptions of scheduled activities, travel, local and international commerce, and stock markets may be considered by the populace as significant as health concerns.<br /><br />And yes, what we stated in last month’s message holds true: The coronavirus and all attendant publicity will fizzle out, and, like all other activities devised by the dark ones, diseases they design and let loose will come to an end.<br /><br />Often we have urged you to send love-light to the dark ones because of all members of our universal family, they are most desperately in need of it. They cause terrible conditions worldwide because they are devoid of that energy except for the spark that is their life force.<br /><br />Some of you have asked if there is a way to send only the light aspect of love-light to individuals who do abhorrent things. No, dear ones, there isn’t—love and light cannot be divided into two compartments. While you could say that light is the makeup of the soul and love is a capacity of the soul, those cannot be separated any more than the soul can be separated from God and Creator.",UCxrkoCr4ELGwg0f5ML_WNPQ,0,UgxEcThCTDYo3jTvjhB4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Archangel Michael answers….<br /><br />Archangel Michael in a personal reading with Steve Beckow through Linda Dillon, Feb. 20, 2020.<br />by Steve Beckow<br /><a href=""https://goldenageofgaia.com/2020/02/28/306838/"">https://goldenageofgaia.com/2020/02/28/306838/</a><br />Steve: What is the true story of the breakout of the coronavirus?<br />Archangel Michael: It is not simply one story and this is part of the difficulty that those who are engaged – and there are several, shall we say, interested parties – who like to offer rather simplistic explanations around this or any other, what you can think of, as a virus.<br /><br />First of all, it is important to realize, whether it is natural occurring (which is a curious remark, is it not?) or shall we say, laboratory created, that any virus that in fact becomes alive (because there are many that are simply dormant) is related to the infection or the poison of emotions and belief systems. That is what infects people and that is what kills people.<br /><br />Now, the human race is not prepared obviously, especially in their panic, to be able to comprehend this because they look to their science for all answers rather than looking for the root cause and addressing it from that.<br /><br />So the true story: The coronavirus was created in a laboratory. It was a weaponized virus and it has been let loose by those who have been (not intentionally, by the way, let loose) but by irresponsible handling of the toxin.<br /><br />Steve: … In Wuhan China?<br /><br />AAM: Correct<br /><br />Steve: Did they steal that from a Canadian lab?<br /><br />AAM: No.<br /><br />Steve: Did the United States play role?<br /><br />AAM: No, it is not about the United States although they will be adversely affected as well because as you well know, there are many belief systems in this side of the globe that also need clarification.<br /><br />Steve: Is Bill Gates implicated in any way?<br /><br />AAM: He has nothing to do with this.<br /><br />Steve: Because he has a patent on the coronavirus.<br /><br />AAM: He has nothing to do with they irresponsible release of the coronavirus.<br /><br />Steve: Yes, but he does have a vaccine…<br /><br />AAM: It is not a vaccine that is fully effective or ready.<br /><br />Steve: There was an exercise having to do with the coronavirus outbreak weeks before it happened. That’s very suspicious.<br /><br />AAM: Do not look for back stories that may or may not be accurate, Sweet One.<br /><br />Steve: OK. Will this have a tremendously adverse effect on China?<br /><br />AAM: No. In fact, in the long run, it will not. Now, is it creating a difficult situation? Most certainly. But what it is also doing, it is actually doing two things in the bigger sense of outcome.<br /><br />One, it is demonstrating the dictatorial nature of their culture, of their ability to restrain, contain, etc. And, so, it is bringing to the forefront again, collective and lineage memories of autocracy. So that is the first thing.<br /><br />But the second thing is it is also creating and reinforcing within the collective, their own ability to rise to the situation that is extraordinarily dangerous and difficult.<br /><br />So, on the one hand, it is showing them that they are in a political regime that is perhaps too controlling but on the other hand it is also raising what you can think of the sense of collective and individual sufficiency and ability to act in a very positive way.<br /><br /><br />VIDEO LINK TO PIXIE SPEAKING OF IT - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC4FQRHFOVo&amp;feature=emb_logo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC4FQRHFOVo&amp;feature=emb_logo</a><br /><br /><br />The virus is still mutating and evolving both spiritually and biologically.<br />Mutations do not hold power over organic structures that harmonize with Source Frequency.<br />There are 3 coded seed points of origin for the virus that are important to understand for manifesting the antidote.<br />The first two are black box programs that had other intentions.<br />The first seed point intention was as biological warfare to be used as insurance policy in battlegrounds, not for civilian use.<br />Believing that service-to-self factions have the power and ability to unleash biological warfare on Humanity creates extreme dis-empowerment, and activates the victim/savior template through fear.<br />The second seed point intention was hybridization experimentation with biological life forms, such as gene splicing and cloning. It used animal and plant DNA, not Human.<br />The creation was god-complex related as well as to genetic testing.<br />The third seed that resulted in the mutation was of natural means. Not black box, but still dis-harmonious. It was around the exploitation and disregard of and cruelty towards animal life forms.<br />The three seed points came together over a period of time and through a series of events to create a distorted, mutated virus at the cellular level within a certain faction of the captive animal kingdom.<br />It then spread to the wild animal kingdom through deliberate means.<br />It then migrated into the Human kingdom becoming a virulent strain as it once again mutated.<br />It was accidental in it’s version as Coronavirus.<br />There have been other ‘Coronaviruses’, but none like this one, yet it bears the same name.<br />Saying it was deliberate is partly but not completely true.<br />Saying it was naturally occurring is also partly but not completely true.<br />Fighting about it brings about the black box program to divide Humanity.<br />Individuals allows themselves to be hijacked by taking a polarity stance.<br />Humanity at large is targeted when it comes to the creation of division within, however it is the individuals themselves who allow themselves to be hijacked this way when they take a polarity stance.<br />The Antidote is to hold balance and a disposition that is pragmatic, objective, alert, aware, open, accepting, logical, intuitive and non-judgmental within the higher thought processes. It’s making judgments with integrity within 3rd dimensional reality.<br />The virus has been hijacked to create fear, panic and chaos in order to prevent carbon to crystalline transformation within Humanity, cosmic memory recall and thus, Ascension.<br />Humanity at large has been targeted for this. However, it is of the utmost import for you to be fully aware of and know that the hijacking can target the carbon aspect only.<br />The crystalline aspect cannot be hijacked and your knowing of this IS your antidote.<br />The crystalline code shields and shelters the carbon aspect, making you immune.<br />The chemical antidote vaccine is a major black box program false antidote containing DNA scrambling codices to prevent crystalline transformation and ascension.<br />This vaccine is a false antidote.<br />Critical mass for the ascension timeline has been reached by humanity, and all black box programs are backfiring and mutating themselves from dark intention into light as manifestation.<br />The antidote in it’s entirety is a lifestyle, a mindset and a spiritual path that must be undertaken by you, the spiritual warrior.<br />You create the antidote together, at the collective level, as One. You shield those that are unable to add their consciousness to this antidote.<br />The vaccine is the false immunity. Your collective power of light is the true immunity. Your knowing of this at the deepest intrinsic levels gives you the immunity and thus you build your architectural, energetic shield.<br />By the time the virus reaches humanity at large it is no longer any threat to the healthy individual with strong immune system in place.<br />Regarding 5G ~ The electro-magnetic aspect of the human organism is scrambled or miscoded, creating an immune compromised human organism through close proximity to original 5G testing areas.<br />The 5G created grid is a false bandwidth and wavelength.<br />It’s partly but not entirely true that the coronavirus is 5G poisoning. Original 5G scrambles the DNA code, and the human biofield connects to the false energetic signalling. This took place around the same time as the mutated virus migrated over to the human kingdom, yet was a different and separate black box program that was subsequently hijacked and linked together. As we have said, this situation is a convergence…<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />THE CORONAVIRUS, WHY IT REALLY HAPPEND...? .AMERICA BORROWED FROM CHINA, BACK IN 1933, $ 800 BILLION DOLLAR&#39;S, AND NOW , IT DOESN&#39;T WANT TO PAY IT BACK ...?

3331,UgzkSL39cn-reCOjzMd4AaABAg,0.0,2,2020-03-16 10:44:16,NoFailer,"European here. It is very interesting to follow the debates etc. as an outsider. I have not been to the US (yet) so I don&#39;t know what it is like (to live) there with Trump as president (and in comparison to Obama prior). I can only go by what my american friends are telling me. Anyway, back to the debate/clip here. I think it is very obvious that Sanders has plans in mind, knows where he wants to go, a clear direction and you can tell by the confidence he emits when he makes his points. <br /><br />At least in this clip, Biden looks like he is struggling, he does not really know how to respond to some questions or problems and uses general filler phrases instead. The &quot;no <b>*new*</b> fracking&quot; part immediately caught my attention. That was a moment where he definitely thought about how much he can lie to his voters and/or to his backers/donors, walking the fine line of &quot;technically saying the truth but leaving parts out&quot;. &quot;No new fracking&quot; is a very flexible term here. What exactly does count as &quot;new&quot;? Does for example any already planned fracking but not yet executed fall under that? Additionally, he goes off-topic many times, trying to mask the fact that he is either out of points or just not well prepared to talk about for example climate change.<br /><br />Overall, I think Sanders absolutely won this one. He listens to scientists, researchers and other experts. And I mean actual experts from universities and research facilities etc. and not the random people the media often tends to label as such.<br /><br />I am not going to tell you who you should vote for in this case but please think about it for a good while. You only have to do this every 4 years so it is not too much to ask to put a little bit of effort into informing yourself, comparing every candidates points, looking at their history etc. Use the internet and do not listen to the media. Believe what you want to believe after you feel like you understood most aspects of it, not because others told you to do so.<br /><br />However, whatever you do, please do not re-elect Trump if you do not want to be the reason the US is the the laughing stock of this planet for another term.",UCSMlHofLJv4ZGWwvyG5yMvw,0,UgzkSL39cn-reCOjzMd4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

That is the problem. he can&#39;t be a president in his state .in about 4-5 years he will show strong mental aging symptoms.I say this is the horror situation cause the alternatives are not even half as competent or maybe not even willing to do something for the people,but they have upper hand since they are much younger in general,more rich and organised. you leave in a vacation for 5 days and you want someone to paint your house while you are away.ho will you call to pain your house fast and well? your 90 years old neighbour that used to be one of the best painters in the world in his prime or the new younger and better equiped professionals that want to charge you triple money for same thing?hard choice,its all about how much you value your money and your home.really complex problem. if Bernie was 20 years younger now, Trump would be some rich guy in US you heard about and thats all,not even close to any leadership position in us gov. ,as for president?in his dreams maybe.

No networks, no premiums, no deductibles, no copays, no surprise bills. Medicare coverage will be expanded and improved to include: include dental, hearing, vision, and home- and community-based long-term care, in-patient and out-patient services, mental health and substance abuse treatment, reproductive and maternity care, prescription drugs, and more. Stop the pharmaceutical industry from ripping off the American people by making sure that no one in America pays over $200 a year for the medicine they need by capping what Americans pay for prescription drugs under Medicare for All. Guarantee tuition and debt-free public colleges, universities, HBCUs, Minority Serving Institutions and trade-schools to all. Cancel all student loan debt for the some 45 million Americans who owe about $1.6 trillion and place a cap on student loan interest rates going forward at 1.88 percent. Invest $1.3 billion every year in private, non-profit historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions End equity gaps in higher education attainment. And ensure students are able to cover non-tuition costs of attending school by: expanding Pell Grants to cover non-tuition and fee costs, tripling funding for the Work-Study Program, and more. Double union membership within Bernie’s first term. Establish federal protections against the firing of workers for any reason other than “just cause.” Provide unions the ability to organize through a majority sign up process and enact “first contract” provisions to ensure companies cannot prevent a union from forming by denying a first contract. Deny federal contracts to companies that pay poverty wages, outsource jobs overseas, engage in union busting, deny good benefits, and pay CEOs outrageous compensation packages Eliminate “Right to Work for Less” laws and guarantees the right to unionize for workers historically excluded from labor protections, like farm workers and domestic workers. Transform our energy system to 100 percent renewable energy and create 20 million jobs needed to solve the climate crisis. Ensure a just transition for communities and workers, including fossil fuel workers. Ensure justice for frontline communities, especially under-resourced groups, communities of color, Native Americans, people with disabilities, children and the elderly. Save American families money with investments in weatherization, public transportation, modern infrastructure and high-speed broadband. Commit to reducing emissions throughout the world, including providing $200 billion to the Green Climate Fund, rejoining the Paris Agreement, and reasserting the United States’ leadership in the global fight against climate change.

Joe Biden&#39;s not about to put his classic Corvette out in the front yard and use it as a planter any more than Bernie is going to move into a tiny house, sell his other 3 houses and stop flying on private jets. We don&#39;t have viable options to fossil fuels at this point, people have to commute and people can&#39;t afford boutique energy sources. The only rational thing to do at this point in time is seriously look at nuclear energy for electricity production. There are amply qualified scientists appearing all over Youtube that dispute the leftist 97% claims in terms of severity and immediacy of any required actions. In fact, the &quot;97%-of-scientists poppycock&quot; should read, &quot;97% of liberal, tax revenue, government student loan subsidy and grant money dependent college professors (i.e. scientists) agree that climate change is a major threat and conveniently implore the government to keep funding them as long as they decree the need to do so.&quot; The colleges and professors keep getting richer while the rest of us subsidize their largesse and see our quality of life decrease exponentially. The government creating scarcity of resources is not an answer to anything other than to those who wish to Lord over us. I&#39;m not interested in having know-nothing politicians and faceless bureaucrats Lording over me. If climate change can be affected by our actions then cutting the red tape and promoting Nuclear energy is the only thing these pinheads should be considering. I can&#39;t fill my gas tank with windmills or solar cells, afford to pay $10/gallon for gas or use my car as a planter, walk 40 miles to work each day, nor wish to be beholding to Iran, the Saudis or Russia for gas if we shut down our production. A replacement for gasoline in our cars will come in time but we&#39;re not there and shutting down our oil and natural gas production is akin to shooting ourselves in the foot. Isn&#39;t it funny that &quot;progressive&quot; college professors don&#39;t ever suggest shutting down the old-fashioned, wasteful educational model consisting of brick and mortar universities nor promote on-line earning which would eliminate people having to drive to school and the need to heat or cool large classroom buildings and ancillaries. Did any of the 97% suggest such a thing? Nah.

This is really more of a mitigation kind of question considering the fact that global warming no matter what we do will hit us in some way. How to reduce how bad it will be is the kind of stuff Jake Tapper is about how we could get malaria in Florida and Arkansas and who knows how far North. Biden answered to a small extent but it sounds like he was starting to go in a xenophobic Direction but then pulled back as he should because that&#39;s a bad place to go and had a half-assed answer. This is directly related to our current circumstance of covid - 19 where we need to think about not only the current crisis but how will deal with future crises in healthcare. The end my assessment is both candidates lost on this question. Bernie should have won cuz I feel like you should know better, but he didn&#39;t address the health issues especially disease transmission issues that will be part of global warming in the future. For example, viruses and bacteria that are released from glaciers that are human bodies have no idea what the hell they are because they haven&#39;t been around for who-knows-how-long. These are a thing. As is the fact that diseases that are more traditionally tropical diseases will be able to travel North as mosquitoes and other kind of vectors are able to flourish in latitudes they weren&#39;t able to before. It&#39;s also a matter of migration, we can&#39;t deny that fact as well but it&#39;s very dangerous to look at humans as the vectors.

Nothing will fundamentally change.&#39;. The rich isn&#39;t a monolith monster of the poor&#39;s nightmares. They are real people. Bankers, fossil industry execs, media execs, Wallstreet suits, big pharma boys and such. They fund his campaign. They fund Republicans AND Democrats and have for years. That&#39;s who Biden spoke to. Their will be done. Their riches and wellbeing cared for. In decades of government, the House and Senate have worked to enact changes that benefit corporations and rich folks, not the average citizen. They do not reflect the public interest in their laws and votes. Look it up. This isn&#39;t hyperbole, it&#39;s fact. <br /><br />Biden wanted and worked for a lot of bills that ruined people&#39;s lives. Look up his record. He said he didn&#39;t care that young people are suffering. &#39;Give me a break!&#39;, he said when their struggles were brought up not too long ago. He wants to cut entitlements. He lies constantly. He lied tonight, many times and not one moderator fact-checked him! He lied and said he fought for civils rights and got arrested in South Africa trying to see an imprisoned Mandela. He&#39;s been lying for decades and steals glory. <br /><br />What does he offer regular voters? He says &#39;a return to normalcy, decency. America won&#39;t be a laughing stock.&#39;, yet what&#39;s decent about him? He inappropriately touches men, women and children (Trump&#39;s a rapist and sexual predator, so worse), lies (Trump lies too), curses voters (like Trump), threatens physical violence against voters (unlike Trump) who ask him questions, isn&#39;t bright (don&#39;t know which one is dumber), brags about the accomplishments of others - brazenly attributing them to himself (pretty much like Trump), he is in severe cognitive decline ( worse than Trump), he is corrupt; his corruption allowed him to collect donations (bribes) and then vote the way the donors wanted (same as Trump). His normalcy is going back to doing the bidding of his donors. That leaves the average guy to continue to not be able to discharge his debt, get a decent minimum wage, lose his job, not afford to go to the doctor when ill, worry a big, bad hurricane will blow his house down and much more. This is what is happening now. Biden offers the same existence as under Trump because they both work for the rich. Biden is a senile moron just like Trump (except Trump seems less senile). World leaders see this. World citizens see this and Biden&#39;s senility and lies are openly discussed in the news in various European countries and Australia (so the world will marvel at the incompetency and continue to laugh). Biden is factually incapable of governing just like Trump except Trump&#39;s dumber and lacts intellectual curiosity to learn to lead while Biden is senile and will be a puppet. So we suffer now, suffered under Obama, suffered before Obama, will continue to suffer under Biden. Biden wants wars and will continue to wage them just like Trump. He would veto Medicare for all, because his pharma donors and others don&#39;t want to pay practical taxes. So screw average Joe&#39;s illness! Let him go to the emergency room when his sickness is kiling him. So no, you&#39;re wrong. The orange monstrosity is horrible, but Biden&#39;s no better. Still not convinced? Trump appoints corporate friendly judges, so did Obama and so will Biden. Why? Money, corruption and the idolatry of big coperations are Biden&#39;s god. His record proves it. <br /><br />Biden claims he is against the ill treatment of migrants, wants to pass immigration reform and more, but never did anything to stop or help these issues, just the opposite. Claims he can get Republicans to work for and with him, yet sat his ass down and did nothing when he was Vice president?!? When someone has power and leadership and doesn&#39;t do shit, why give them more. To give it to them knowing your life will remain a misery and other poor demonized people&#39;s lives will not improve, is idiocy. It&#39;s not harm reduction because Biden will be harming us. Hyperbole?! No! He said he would veto Medicare for All if Congress passes it! Trump is a cancer, but giving senile puppet Biden who won&#39;t do any better, our vote, is suicide. By the way, who will be running the government??? Considering Biden&#39;s senility, he can only be a puppet.

He should rely on a measure of risk-weighted assets. Second of all, he is planning on financing a good portion of his program with additional transaction fees on the trading of stocks and financial derivatives which is also a short term funding method since markets will immediately find new ways to trade financial instruments and this could also compromise the efficiency of the overall markets, which means that markets will look for financial instruments abroad, not paying this fee he is introducing. Then he is planning on introducing universal healthcare.

The fact of the matter is Sanders KNOWS there’s no room for reasoned discussion in our political culture on WHY someone wanted to make cuts to social security at one point or another, and purposely took his words out of context in his attack ad. He knew exactly what he was doing and you’re ignorant if you can’t see it. In that video, he wanted to freeze virtually ALL federal spending including social security COLA’s, but NOT SOCIAL SECURITY.

Run an ad quoting the part where he said social security, when he meant cost of living adjustments, and was hoping his supporters were too dumb to understand the context of wanting to freeze federal spending to address a deficit crisis that many at the time thought would cause an economic crash. He was right. Freezing social security COLA’s means everyone would have received the exact same social security check as the previous year, it just wouldn’t go up $24 to adjust for cost of living, for the duration of one year while the government balanced the budget.

Numerous times, Republicans pushed for large cuts, and Biden offered smaller but substantial cuts, in compromise. This was a wrong approach many Republicans aim to eventually, incrementally eliminate these programs altogether. Creating incremental reductions allows the GOP to make progress towards eventual elimination. Bernie is right. In every instance, Joe Biden was urging what amounted to cuts in social security. You can spin and explain the context all you want, but that's the fact. I assume Bernie left out the fact that during the Obama Administration, Joe Biden supported cuts to social security as part of a so-called ""Grand Bargain"" with the Republicans, who were too stupid to take them up on it. I assume Bernie left out this most recent example of Biden supporting social security cuts because he didn't want to be seen as critical of Barack Obama.      https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/05/176351738/obama-riles-his-own-party-with-social-security-offer https://theintercept.com/2020/01/25/joe-biden-social-security/ Also, deficits are not the challenge that we've been led to believe.

Sanders talks of climate change that farmers wont be able to produce the food we need. If we put the oil and gas industry out of business we have two choices, buy oil from other nations and pay what they want for it. Second if he intends to stop all use of oil and gas from any where, how do we farm? Tractors need diesel to run on. The other issue is how to you go to work or get the food to the markets. There is no technology that can power trucks,tractors,dozers,excavators or any equipment to build or produce with other than diesel fuel. How do we produce steel to build with or make repairs to anything we have now? Wind and solar does not heat a steel mill. Wind and solar does not power our ships that bring goods from over seas. Wind and solar will not run a nation, or build roads or repair roads, because it takes oil to make asphalt to build roads and repair them. In fact many things we have and use everyday come from oil it is how we live and prosper. Maybe if we all will go back to just the family farm grow and store all we need no power tools horses to plow with, cows for milk and butter and meat, raise all that we eat no need for large stores just the small family owned ones, no cell phones, no tvs or modern anything.

He took two separate issues -- the corona virus, which we know very little about, and climate change -- and loaded it into one question with the hope that Bernie would underplay the importance of the current virus emergency and be humiliated. And that was pretty shameful. Jake Tapper is a snarky weasel, and he was that way even when he was with ABC. If you have effective measures that can slow down and somehow prepare for all of the inevitable horrors from global warming, then the risk from whatever disease or damage to our health that global warming could possibly create would be of course be minimized as well. This is a good example of why we can&#39;t even trust corporate media with a debate between two people. The huge threat that global warming is waging upon us, which the corporate elite does not want to deal with because it gets in the way of business as usual, is our number one threat. The second number one threat is nuclear weapon proliferation, which the U.S. does not want to do anything about because our close friend in the middle east, Israel, would be the country more likely than not to use such a weapon on another country, but that phony corporate media hack Jake Tapper wouldn&#39;t want to talk about Israel and their nuclear weapons.

Taxes on the rich! So they are all working against Bernie to push their agenda, whether it hurts Americans or not and Americans are falling for it cause the word “taxes” and “socialism” have been made to made to sound as scary as possible even if it means universal healthcare where everyone and everything is covered with no extra costs! It’s way cheaper than paying insurance and even with insurance they don’t cover everything so you have out of pocket costs! With universal healthcare you don’t have out of pocket costs, detectable’s, just healthcare! You can still go to the same doctor, hospital, specialists at no extra cost!! Not enough People in America don’t see that the rich in America run the country! They run the government by paying off the politicians, they decide the policies that will be made so it doesn’t affect their bottom line, they don’t pay taxes, they decide who’s going to be elected! These are things Bernie wants to change and that’s why everyone is against him! It’s not cause Bernie has bad policies or has a horrible past behind him... it’s not even cause he’s the most likely person to beat Trump cause there’s nothing that Trump can use against him! It’s the rich being in control and them pushing a person that has obvious early stage Alzheimer’s or something along those lines, and Americans falling for the media’s lies rather than voting in their best interests cause they just want things before Trump was president instead of having things better than before Trump was elected!! There’s still time to change things, but every young voter at least will have to come out and vote in the primaries instead of sitting in front of their computers! There might be a chance cause older people might be afraid to vote cause of the Coronavirus! Everyone on the internet needs to spread the word to get people out to vote in the last few states! Trump’s a boarderline dictator, 4 more years and America will probably no longer be a democracy. If Biden’s elected and nothing changes it’s going to give way for an actual dictator next time around!! Bernie has to be elected! America’s future depends on it!

6581,Ugw7wrXr3hPWUf_3xvd4AaABAg,0.0,0,2020-03-16 02:57:05,Christopher Calder,"<b>Bernie Sanders wants America to commit suicide to solve a problem that does not exist.</b> There is no &quot;climate crisis&quot; and there is no &quot;greenhouse gas effect.&quot; Dr. Ned Nikolov and Dr. Karl Zeller used advanced mathematical analysis techniques to study the climates of rocky surfaced planets and moons in our solar system. They found they could accurately predict their long term average surface temperatures by knowing just two strategic facts: their distance from the Sun and their atmospheric pressure. This formula has worked correctly for Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Pluto, and for Earth’s moon, Europa, Callisto, Titan, and Triton. Their predictions have been proven accurate to within one degree Celsius. Like the value of Pi, this mathematical relationship will never go away because it was created by Nature, not by man. <br /><br />This means that the specific gaseous composition of the atmospheres of planets and moons are irrelevant to determining their long-term average surface temperatures. For example, the atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, while Earth’s atmosphere contains only .04% carbon dioxide, yet that information was not even needed to predict temperature. The logical conclusion is that atmospheric gases only contribute to warming by their physical mass, which increases atmospheric pressure.

Free Market of PEOPLE answers: Enough for what – consumption or production? Socialists only think of consumption bc they are selfish. For consumption- relatively little but for production, expansion and continuation of production Billions, TRILLIONS. Yes expansion. It is expansion of your BEING &amp; SOUL contrary to what Socialist liars told you! Expansion means expansion of goods and services, that is, expansion of progressively higher standard of life of people. If quantity of commodities increases on the market, prices decrease while Socialism necessarily decreases productive output of “unequal” pizzas &amp; “unequal” aspirins &amp; &quot;unequal&quot; doctors hence increases prices in order to eliminate those goods &amp; services you know “because they are inequality”. Drop in supply on the market increases prices. So it is Production for the people, not for “them 1% billionaire class”. Profit is simply a successful response to demand of people. “But how much” production for the people? How can the people endure these lower and lower prices and higher and higher standard of living, ask the Socialists saying: “you got spoiled with “Capital-ism” and failing to see life is oppression, that is to say, failing to see that life or free voluntary exchanges of people beneficial or good in their own eyes is not life, reality, beings or people but “ideology” called “system” or “corporate power structure” or “Wall-street”. How much money is enough? My money is none of your business. That question is a crime. God answers: “Is it illegal for me to do whatever I want to do with my own?

Illegal immigration from the southern border is my problem. There is a certain amount of illegal immigration any country is going to expect but because this country identifies with race over ideas, a country like this needs a way more diverse yet numerically similar voting block. However, there is human capital to mine in this country if we give citizens access to resources. All immigrants that come here are in 2 generations culturally from America. That means they adopt the traits people look down on US citizens for. This isn't a problem that gets solved by more immigrant to be the working class. We have to change how we think of our own people and how we think of ourselves. Then places that have a need for refuge wouldn't face the same level of xenophobia. This is more behaviour than anything else. On average people don't like new people and less so if it becomes a competition for resources. By capitalistic logic, what's happening at the border makes perfect sense. A group of people a can manipulate the playing field to reduce the productivity of group b.

Rewarding stock is standard practice - but the Fed'l Gov't isn't allowed to SEIZE it permanently. - Gov't can tax / regulate activities like off-shoring to _influence_ decisions, but Bernie is banning it. E.g. It's poor economic policy to raise super-high tariffs on all trade willy-nilly, but this is more akin to just cutting off trade. Competing and capitalism require a level playing field, not extreme protectionism. - Healthcare is certainly in need of reform, but M4A is not the panacea it has been described to be. Actually executing it as a project has to be done through trialing (like medical treatment, eh?), never mind financially vetted. Bernie's been blowing smoke up everyone's gastrointestinal tract. As pitched, almost all technological development in medicine would cease - and I don't know about you, but I was hoping for solutions to cancer, Alzheimers, diabetes, etc. The relatively tiny ACA couldn't even get a simple web site right, plus gobs of their justifications and assumptions were just plain wrong. M4A is a 60% INCREASE IN THE FED'L GOV'T! *Based on the delays and massive cost overruns of VIRTUALLY EVERY Gov't project in the past (Remember the $700 military hammers?), what could possibly go wrong?* - I'm all for infrastructure spending, if done judiciously (e.g. updating bridges and highways). But mandating that we tear down almost every building to improve its energy use is ludicrous. Just the act of doing that will likely lead to a net rise in carbon use across the globe to say nothing of the unjustifiable (and HUGE) expense. Maybe after we simply stop bridges from collapsing and potholes from swallowing Smart cars, we could _consider_ doing a bit of the infrastructure work that was naively outlined in the GND. - Minimum wage should go up, but $15/hr in Los Angeles and $15/hr in Podunk, Mississippi are two vastly different things. Since it's federal, the amount should be at the low end so rural Mom 'n Pop stores can afford to exist and hire more people. States and cities should adjust accordingly. But, yeah, time to raise it some. - Interestingly, as you allude to, Bernie used to be very much like Trump on immigration issues - strong border and lots of protectionism against immigrants (legal and illegal) ""stealing"" Americans' jobs. He either had an epiphany, or _a political change of heart,_ and that's why he's almost Mr. Open Borders with consequent Hispanic support. Personally, I believe we need many more immigrants, as they can be the life-blood of innovation in ""the land of opportunity."" I am, however, in favor of being more selective by skill to some degree, rather than simply by having relatives here. Illegal immigration needs to be gotten under control and not rewarded every generation with citizenship. ""The Middle Class"" are the people who actually pay a net positive in taxes and are not the top couple %. *They will be burdened with all these massive spending programs Bernie has dangled out there in the name of **_democratic socialism,_** because, as Willie Sutton said, ""That's where the money is.""* You may trust Bernie to spend all of your money, but I don't. Getting rid of Trump is an imperative, not just because he's a menace at the job, but because he's a narcissistic sociopath with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. However, it's nice to know our system/country is so strong that it could abide the reign of such an affliction. _We could (probably) survive Bernie too._",UCxopTD1JZokDL_ZH-HK8yIg,1,UgxamAxJYjXqgaoCa1B4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

I don't think Bernie is perfect by any means but like with any candidate you take what you can get. I know Biden is a moderate who will not change anything except go back on immigration which is one of the things I wasn't beating up on Trump about and one thing that Bernie isn't my preference. The way people misconstrue Bernie is the same way they misconstrue Trump. Once again I do not know where you are politically and I am not assuming and I don't care. I mention this to illustrate a point. Demonization of a person who wants system wide change is protecting who? The middle class has been thinning out for a while and there are a small glut of monopolies that have vast power and have been fighting to get it back since they lost it to FDR. You can deny it if you like but those companies were put on regulation for a reason. I don't want banks to act as Vegas tourists and companies to be able to buy influence in elections. I see the economic moves that the current president is making and they are in favor of any Republican but just with less restraint. Wild and unrealistic unlimited growth is a poor substitute for sustainability.,UCzCNQZVWhrvsC3pPBakZong,1,UgxamAxJYjXqgaoCa1B4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

I can't say for sure but I think most Americans think off shoring is bad. I don't know details of Frances situation but it seems being in the EU is their major problem. About the Medicare for all plan; If healthcare was working then why is there a need for any of this reform? My neighbor is a nurse and she says it is a really bad system. I pay insurance for healthcare, the increase I got from the tax cut went to that once the rate raised. Why are you against Infrastructure spending?

And Joe Biden hasn't done shit either but steal from tax payers, fatten his pockets and take money from corporations to pass Bill's that benefit them. I was a Democrat for decades, voted Obama twice, finally started really paying attention and doing my OWN research, get news reports from all sides, and take it and look into it myself. Found out that all MSM was lying and producing PROPAGANDA. A bill that Obama signed allowed for media to lie to the American people and use propaganda. So I started looking into congress men and women, on both sides. Started seeing crimes committed from them. Most have been removed on the Republican side, but there are still a few left. But on the left, it is RIDDLED with corruption. Election rigging/tampering, tax money laundering/stealing. They pass aid Bill's to Book publishing companies, millions and millions, and the publishing companies have ""sister companies"". Smaller companies with different names but still owned by the major publishing company (Pearsons publishing I THINK), Next, the Publishing companies give book deals to these people in our government, for the exact amount of money that congress gave them, minus a small percentage for doing the deal. They do the same thing with foreign aid, (Hunter & Joe Biden). Romney & his son, Pelosi & her son, Kerry's & son, all energy/gas companies, all their sons were put on the boards of these companies, with no experience, millions of OUR tax dollars sent over, routed through multiple banks in foreign countries, and eventually ends back up to energy companies. The companies keep a small percentage for the deal, the rest is sent back via ""paycheck"" to whoever son is on the board, and only has to show up to job 1 or 2 times a year. Also with Planned Parenthood, they send millions, PPH keeps percentage and sends the rest back via ""donations "" to the DNC or Hillary foundation. Go ask yourself why Dems have been fighting so hard to keep PPH and to continue sending ""foreign aid"" to countries that NEVER get better, cleaner or richer. Now lastly, ask yourself how they get ""good"" lawful congressmen and women to agree with them and vote to pass their Bill's to send all this money, that's where Jeffrey Epstein came into play, he would provide ""entertainment"", young girls/boys kids etc.. all while secretly recording them. He would allow them to do anything they wanted to these people. Kill them, rape them, eat them, etc... If it happens to be a good person that doesn't do that stuff, they eventually get drugged/setup and recorded to use and blackmail all of them. This involves CEOs, ACTORS/ACTRESSES, Judges, police leaders, Congress, Presidents, Princes, Priests, News reporters/owners etc. That is why a select group of people have for 3 years attacked President Trump nonstop to try and get him removed. Because Trump ran on ""he's gonna drain the swamp"" (corrupted criminals in our government). He was best for the job because he was part of their group at 1 time, (minus the parts with kids), he knows all their dirty secrets. ""Those who shout the loudest, have the most to lose""... now who has it been? The Dems that were shouting are the ones that were part of the money laundering, the actors, Tom Hanks, Robert Deniro, etc. There is a MASSIVE arrest going on right now as I type. The ones that decided to talk and make deals with Trump, and the ones that are clean and on his side are now Patriots. In UK, there was a leader that left a building with Red folder, walked behind a car, came out the other side and the folder was now green. There was a picture of the White House with a red tint, and now it is a green tint, the other day on the capitol building is a video of a green rabbit inside of the letter Q displayed on the top/side of the capitol. And theres many many more... From RED TO GREEN. It's the greenlight showing that it's go time. That's why they want everyone off the streets, it's easier to track everyone, under the cover of this virus. Don't take my word, go look it up, research it. You can do FOIA REQUESTS (freedom of information act requests) and ask for the emails, texts etc. Of your congressmen and women, by law they must provide it to you, unless it's classified. Again, do your own research, we have been lied to and stolen from for DECADES.....

Where he proposes violating the 5th amendment to mandate transfer of 20% ownership of companies to employees, and requiring they get 45% of control in the boardroom? There would no longer be any ""At Will"" employment - you'd have to jump thru the kind of hoops they do in France and Germany to fire/lay-off anyone_ - THAT'S WHY EUROPE CAN'T COMPETE ANY MORE. Have you ever worked in business? Look at France simply trying to become financially viable again on the relatively small issue of its bankruptcy-bound pension plans - under Bernie's vision, the problems would be 10x worse. Government-Promoted Unions? Mandates saying companies CAN'T off-shore their manufacturing? *Sanders' programs would kill capitalism in America,* and with it, all that nice ""Free Money"" to pay for them.* $55 Trillion for the GND? That's just a HUGE Middle Class TAX INCREASE. If you took ALL the money from the 1% you'd still be $25 Trillion short. A _smarter approach_ is necessary, including developing new technology that would be far more effective and value-added, and getting rid of such stupid ideas as rebuilding virtually every building in existence. I also have plenty of objections to Bernie's myriad of Free Money deals that would eventually be paid for by the Middle Class (on top of M4A and the GND, 'cuz there'll be no cost overruns there, I'm sure...lol). Plus, M4A has a few downsides that Sanders NEVER talks about, and perhaps hasn't even considered. Having been in the medical field for 20 years I could outline 5-10 off the top of my head, but Bernie wouldn't want to mention such niggling details while he's dazzling the unwashed masses with Bumper Sticker slogans.",UCxopTD1JZokDL_ZH-HK8yIg,1,UgxamAxJYjXqgaoCa1B4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

He converts possibilities into actualities by setting himself a goal and the means (factors of production) to attain it. No one but the employer, I mean, the Billionaire is the producers. Others simply provide services. Profit is justified because his investment was GOOD: it met the demand of the consuming public. Profit is a successful response to demand. Why should a man not keep what he can earn? Now steps in the envious commie Sanders and tells us, it’s not evil to steal it from them because they actually stole it from you and production will continue no matter what is done to discourage it. Making further threats and removing incentives against production, I mean, against the Billionaire class, Socialists inject uncertainty into the market which, diverts resources from those most urgently needed, distorting the markets reduces supply of producers and affects all prices in the world you have to compete with other nations, the purchasing value of your money goes down and with it the standard of your living.

Look, do you know anything about Socialism and that things will need to be not simply wanted but actually produced under Socialism? Do you know how things are financed in reality [as opposed to Socialism]? PROFIT (&quot;them Billions&quot;)– result greater than the cost (of production) is how things are actually founded and can only be founded sustainably. If socialism cannot cover the cost of its own production, if production cannot be financed it ceases to exist. That’s why Socialism is always fuzzy and unclear on one of the most vital details: Financing – how are you going to pay for it practically? Socialism never answers that. GRADUAL – over the years decline in the quantity of supply of goods and services isn’t evidence of Socialism “Maybe still working”. It isn’t, it never was. It was just emptying your pockets, then imploding as it can only insofar as its financing is based on TAXPAYERS themselves (“the rich” as Socialists like to brand them) lol rather than on &quot;billions of billionaires&quot;. Hope changes into delusional desperation just when you get older and actually need to see a physician Socialism now made inaccessible. Socialism never materializes because it can’t pay for things realistically. <br />Hospital is a business, education is a business, food supply yes - a business: people who produce those things want to be paid, that is only if you want to see more food coming in the future. When paid, there is profit left for continuous operation of production. That’s how things are normally created in reality as opposed to ideology of idealists and academics. If there is no profit, there is no production. Socialist crock-pot answer is: tax “the rich” aka anyone and everyone who works for living. That is the Socialist con: Under free market it is corporations themselves who finance production. Under Socialism it is YOU the taxpayers who do the financing out of your own wallets. And since this is not a rational way to finance production of anything, every other sector of the economy is affected by mis-allocation of capital. This socialist inefficiency rapidly starts costing more, more and more money now out of your pocket until hello Venezuela. <br />Don’t point to Europe like a complete, neurotic dupe. In truth, WHITE PEOPLE, not “Socialism” is that which in Europe works, by not over-drawing public resources when “free”. If it was not a lie Socialism worked in Europe, it would’ve worked in non-white countries. You’ve been lied to. Your vanity has been well-fed by Socialist scum. Socialists exploited people’s doubt and moral weakness. That’s all they do. But Norway! Not “Norway”. Whiteway",UC1xSMOG4S_Exo2nyCTBVOcA,0,UgxBHy0b2mOCKnvbGdZ4AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Arguments to supposed &quot;Socialist Extremity&quot; are false, anathema and a total distraction by the status quo of special interests and establishment practices in a hyper capitalist extreme society otherwise known as &quot;The United States of America&quot; where money and power rule all and dystopian propaganda and a broken system of poor education and oligarchy convince the population to consistently vote against and believe against their own interests and those of the world. Sanders policy&#39;s are completely reasonable and desperately needed and in many cases are the norm in much of Europe which although having many problems of course consistently does better in life expectancy, healthcare, education and well being for members of classes other than elite. It&#39;s time for America to earn back it&#39;s reputation as the greatest country on Earth because it has sadly become an international embarrassment to the civilized world through no fault of the vast majority of it&#39;s decent people. Why can&#39;t America have the same pragmatism and true self interest for once? Because when you guys consistently harm yourself with your vote not only do you suffer but so does the rest of the world because of the influence of America. I would far rather have a sensible pragmatist with the interest of many at heart than an old school centrist with the interests of a few desperately trying to cling on to his political career as well as his cognitive faculties, Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Vote Sanders for President 2020, leave your hate below but if you disagree and can be substantive and debate politely about it I will be surprised and grateful....",UCGsHRQeNaPtCojn4_43tZ-w,0,Ugwf_6HcneFDCbT1rt14AaABAg,aW7LPlp0-q4,2020-03-16 02:09:06

Socialism deals not with reality but with ideas - idea of “humanity as a whole” or with other “holistic” concepts “food”, “housing”, “healthcare”, “education” as opposed to degrees. Such concepts are not things but ideas advertised as things. Commodities or things minus prices are not things but ideas in your head. Socialism cannot work because its goal is removal of the corner stone of real things: prices, conditions to entry or &quot;barriers to access&quot;. Healthcare without prices which cover cost of production over time is not healthcare but negation of healthcare, ideology of healthcare. Prices or conditions are not external to healthcare, not “impurities” or “pollution” in healthcare but healthcare in itself. Prices of healthcare ARE healthcare. Prices are the nature of healthcare. Prices of healthcare are the universal healthcare. Healthcare not connected to producers by prices is not healthcare. Healthcare independent of conditions of time &amp; place, that is, healthcare outside space &amp; time is not real healthcare but gap in healthcare, idea, ideology in reality, Muller Healthcare. <br />In this way Socialism is not responding to reality bc it is not responding to people. People don’t want “food”, “housing”, “healthcare”, “education” . People want things in time &amp; place, namely, people want very specific &amp; particular [read: ‘unequal’] degree, kind, quality, quantity etc of food or house or education or healthcare at every point in time. The opposite of “Free” are “prices”. Prices are signals to producers what people actually want to consume at a given [“unequal”] time &amp; place. The miracle of prices informs producers about all that they need to know to respond to people’s actual demand &amp; maintain that response over time. Prices tell producers who wants what, when, where, how much or up to what point. Prices consumers send to producers about their desires is the most vital element in people. Without prices there is no people bc there is no production for the people. “Food”, “housing”, “healthcare”, “education” without prices are not commodities but concepts. No one ever wants “food” or “education” or “healthcare”. Those are ideas of idealists, not things people in time &amp; place actually ask for. Socialism fails bc it doesn’t respond to people, it responds not to reality but to arbitrary concepts outside of time &amp; place.

In Virginia, 1.3 million people voted, a huge increase from the 780,000 votes cast in the state’s 2016 Democratic primary. In Texas, more than 2.1 million ballots have been counted with 99 percent of precincts reporting. That’s up from 1.4 million votes four years ago. Yet, Mr. Sanders again lost both states — and captured smaller shares of the vote than in 2016. That year, Mr. Sanders won 33 percent of the vote in Texas. This year, he got only 30 percent.

But seeing as I can't prove whether you are or not, I will tell you what I do know. I have been to the hospital more than 20 times in my life. I have been to hospitals in more than four provinces, the largest being Ontario and the smallest being Prince Edward Island. Allow me to tell you about the most notable instances. 1. Broken arm - I fell off a deck and snapped my wrist. My dad drove me to the emergency room. I was admitted within 10 minutes. I received a temp-plaster cast and pain medication. Following a 1 hour wait, I was brought back in to get an X-Ray. Following the X-Ray I was immediately fitted for a cast. Total Bill: $2.00 for a bag of chips. 2. Allergic Reaction & Severe Anxiety Attack - Picked up by an ambulance. Admitted immediately. Treated immediately. Discharged after 6 hours of excellent care. Total: $40.00 for the ambulance ride. 3. Sprained Thumb - dropped a dumbbell on it. Was seen to by a triage nurse. Given pain meds. Waited 4 hours. Received an X-Ray. Waited 2 hours for results. Given a small thumb splint. Thumb was concluded to be not broken. Total: $0.00 We are not overtaxed. We pay the same taxes as you actually. Our healthcare is excellent. Our pharmaceutical drugs are affordable. There are no lines. You are so tone deaf you actually believe we make our patients stand in a physical line. Thousands of Americans die each year as a result of not being able to access affordable healthcare. Millions are uninsured. Meanwhile, I've paid less than $50.00 over the course of 23 years.
