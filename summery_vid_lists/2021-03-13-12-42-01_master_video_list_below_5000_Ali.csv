Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO We know that humanity's carbon footprint has shifted the baseline conditions of the climate, the context in which every weather event takes place. But trying to isolate the human influence from everything else that is going on can be really hard, especially for hurricanes, or what scientists call ""tropical cyclones."" They're super complex and the quality of the historical data we have for them isn't great. We do have physics, though. Hurricanes are driven by the transfer of heat from the sea to the air through evaporation. The storm's maximum possible wind speed, or its potential intensity, depends in part on how warm the ocean is – and of course, we're warming the ocean. So researchers expect intense tropical cyclones to become frequent if we continue to warm the planet. The hurricanes of the future will also be wetter. So coastal cities will face freshwater flooding from the sky paired with storm surge from the sea, which is higher now because we are also causing sea levels to rise. And that trend of wetter storms isn't just for hurricanes. Heavy precipitation events from other types of storms have been increasing in The US and should continue to increase across the country. Even in places that might see less rain over the whole year, they'll get more days with really heavy precipitation. This comes down to basic physics too: warmer air can take up more water before it dumps it back down on us. All of this means global warming worsens floods like the kind that hit Houston. But it's not our destiny to hurt ourselves like this. It depends on what we choose to do now. We could rethink our infrastructure and regulations to minimize the damage, but unless we also start cutting our carbon emissions and shifting the world to clean energy, it's just going to get worse.

And while there’s little doubt that climate change is to blame, proving that fault for specific weather events hasn’t really been possible… until now. » Subscribe to Seeker! http://bit.ly/subscribeseeker » Watch more Elements! http://bit.ly/ElementsPlaylist » Visit our shop at http://shop.seeker.com An emerging field called extreme-event attribution is helping us measure and verify the relationship between the climate crisis and extreme weather. Not only does this have huge implications for predicting and modeling our planet’s future, but it could also help us better prepare for living in an increasingly extreme world. When we talk about the impacts of the climate crisis, we’re really talking about distinguishing the influence of natural factors from anthropogenic factors on Earth’s climate cycle. Basically, this means teasing apart Earth’s natural climate cycles from human-caused climate change. A way to begin doing this is to examine the “fingerprints” we humans have left behind on Earth’s climate. By matching both the observed and modeled patterns of Earth’s climate, scientists can positively identify the “fingerprints'' associated with these changes. Following the tracks of these fingerprints has helped scientists link climate change with more general trends, like rising sea levels and global temperatures. #climatechange #environment #naturaldisasters #weather #science #seeker #elements Read More: The Decade of Attribution Science https://slate.com/technology/2019/12/attribution-science-field-explosion-2010s-climate-change.html ""Just as medical researchers can study how smoking cigarettes changes people’s risk of lung cancer by comparing data from smokers and nonsmokers, attribution scientists compare events on our planet with those on a hypothetical “Planet B,” one that is untouched by greenhouse gas emissions.""

With the climate crisis gaining recognition around the world and climate strikes in full swing with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in a plea for action against climate change, I figured it would be good to look at what might be the best solution to climate change: trees. Trees capture and store carbon, reducing the amount of CO2 in the air. Recently a study looked at the amount of trees we could plant on Earth, which lead to a lot of people thinking we could solve the climate change issue by planting a trillion trees. But this isn't exactly true. Find out why in my latest video!

Climate change is happening now, and even world leaders meeting for climate talks at this year’s Cop25 know we aren’t doing enough to stop it. In fact, we’re going backwards. The UN says carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are going up, and the earth is on track to warm by 3.2 degrees before the century is over. The consequences of that acceleration are already proving disastrous for communities around the world. This week’s episode of Start Here cuts through the science and the politics, to get you what you need to know about what’s at stake for the planet.

Extreme temperatures across the north and east of the country have caused hundreds of deaths. In the south, the searing hot spell has also led to severe water shortages. The situation has reached a crisis point in Chennai, India's sixth largest city. Residents there are desperate for rain, but monsoon season in Tamil Nadu isn't meant to begin until late fall. Locals are now blaming authorities for failing to recognize the shortage and deal with it early on.

How has coronavirus impacted climate change? Can methods used to track climate change be used to track the spread of coronavirus? We explore these topics and a lot more. Our first guest is Gavin Schmidt, PhD, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. To start, we get a little background on CO2 emissions. How has the air quality changed over the current quarantined period? You’ll learn how the decrease of car and air travel have impacted our climate. We explore how climate modeling is similar to modeling the spread of coronavirus. You’ll also learn the benefits of “simple” vs “complex” modeling. Gavin tells us why models are fundamental to scientific enterprise. Then we welcome our second guest, Katharine Hayhoe, PhD, director of the Climate Center at Texas Tech University. She also has her own YouTube channel called @Global Weirding with Katharine Hayhoe. Katharine explains how coronavirus made the jump from animals to humans (zoonosis) and why this is not the first, or last, time it will happen. You’ll hear why the current pandemic is like a microcosm of climate change. We investigate the role that government has played in this pandemic so far and what governments can learn from dealing with this situation. Katharine explains how this pandemic and climate change are similar in the fact that they both impact the poorest people the hardest. We take a look at the spread of conspiracy theories during this pandemic and how they come from the same places that spread climate change conspiracies. Lastly, you’ll also hear about climatefeedback.org, a website run by a network of scientists to bring you truthful climate change news. All that, plus, Katharine shares a hopeful message for the future. =================================== About the prints that flank Neil in this video: ""Black Swan” & ""White Swan"" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston.

She ended off her speech with a message: ""This is what I want you to focus on. So, please tell me how do you react to these numbers without feeling at least some level of panic?

The British physicist behind BBC's Wonders of the Universe was a guest on the adversarial panel show Q&A. Also on the Australian TV show was senator-elect Malcolm Roberts from the anti-immigration One Nation party. The celebrity scientist was dumbfounded by Mr Roberts' claim that climate change data was manipulated by Nasa.

As families flee water scarcity, crop failure and rising sea levels, the refugee crisis is bound to wreak havoc on the international system with tremendous economic and political consequences. Russia, however, is likely to be insulated from the most disastrous effects. In fact, the Russians actually stand to benefit from climate change in numerous ways, and policymakers in Moscow believe this is their license to global resurgence.

Trees are burning up around the planet at an alarming rate and impacting the climate. Now a new effort to plant as many trees as possible has taken hold around the globe. But will it mitigate climate change? In California, 3 million acres have burned since 2017. And in Brazil, some 121,000 fires have burned since January — more than half in the Amazon rainforest. The fires have cost the planet millions of trees, one of the Earth’s best defenses against climate change. Now a movement around the globe is trying to replace trees lost to fire and deforestation for agriculture or grazing. In Ethiopia, the prime minister announced a new #GreenLegacy initiative that planted more than 353 million trees in 12 hours. Even YouTube stars are getting in on the act: More than 600 social media personalities recently raised over $16 million to plant trees worldwide. The effort was led by Jimmy Donaldson, a YouTube star who’s also known as MrBeast. Reforestation is also a big part of the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. recently abandoned at the behest of President Donald Trump. But can planting billions and billions of trees really mitigate climate change? For that matter, is it even feasible? » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
