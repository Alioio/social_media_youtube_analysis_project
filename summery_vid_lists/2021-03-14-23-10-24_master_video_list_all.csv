A decade ago, Professor Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter coined the phrase ""planetary tipping points"" to describe parts of the Earth's interconnected systems that in the past had been pushed from one state, past an irreversible point, into another. • Subscribe to ITV News on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2lOHmNj • Get breaking news and more stories at http://www.itv.com/news Follow ITV News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itvnews/ Follow ITV News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itvnews Follow ITV News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/itvnews/"	Climate,Emergency,Global warming	25	News & Politics	PT4M23S	263	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XozRD4pWBMk/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	8070	122.0	40.0	0		climate crisis	False	0

Climate change is happening now, and even world leaders meeting for climate talks at this year’s Cop25 know we aren’t doing enough to stop it. In fact, we’re going backwards. The UN says carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are going up, and the earth is on track to warm by 3.2 degrees before the century is over. The consequences of that acceleration are already proving disastrous for communities around the world. This week’s episode of Start Here cuts through the science and the politics, to get you what you need to know about what’s at stake for the planet.

Can we humans save the planet from ourselves? In a new film, alumni Sir David Attenborough and Dr Jane Goodall DBE, and leading Cambridge University researchers, talk about the urgency of the climate crisis – and some of the solutions that will take us towards zero carbon. If we are to avoid climate disaster we must sharply reduce our carbon dioxide emissions starting today – but how? Cambridge researchers describe their work on generating and storing renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, understanding the impact of climate policies, and probing how we can each reduce our environmental impact. We hear how the ambitious new programme Cambridge Zero is bringing together ideas and innovations to tackle the global challenge of climate catastrophe – and inspiring a generation of future leaders – and how the University is looking at its own operations to develop a zero carbon pathway for the future.

It’s endless and relentless. We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases?

This documentary looks at the so-called hotspots of climate change in the Sahel zone, Indonesia and the Russian Tundra. Lake Chad in the Sahel zone has already shrunk by 90 percent since the 1960s due to the increasing heat. About 40 million people will be forced to migrate to places where there is enough rainfall. Migration has always existed as a strategy to adapt to a changing environment. But the number of those forced to migrate solely because of climate change has increased dramatically since the 1990s. It is a double injustice: after becoming rich at the expense of the rest of the world, the industrialized countries are now polluting the atmosphere with their emissions and bringing a second misfortune to the inhabitants of the poorer regions. One of them is Mohammed Ibrahim: as Lake Chad got hotter and drier, he decided to go where the temperatures were less extreme and there was still a little water, trekking with his wife, children and 70 camels from Niger to Chad and then further south. The journey lasted several years and many members of his herd died of thirst. Now he and his family are living in a refugee camp: they only have seven camels left. Mohammed is one of many who have left their homelands in the Sahel - not because of conflict and crises, but because of the high temperatures. He's a real climate refugee. _______ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

The team says that a prolonged heatwave in the Siberian Arctic this year is “unequivocal evidence of climate change’”. The scientists say the record rise in temperatures there would be impossible without man-made global warming. The findings are of serious concern because here in the UK and the rest of Europe, the Arctic drives much of the weather systems we experience.

Joss Fong outlines how this overload of CO2 leads to climate change and reminds us that, unlike Tetris, we won't get an opportunity to start over and try again.

Subscribe to our channel here: https://goo.gl/31Q53F An investigation by Newsnight in conjunction with Greenpeace has found that the government agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), has helped to finance oil and gas projects that, when completed, will emit 69 million tonnes of carbon a year. according to government estimates. That equates to nearly a sixth of the UK’s domestic estimated carbon emissions. This is despite a government commitment to cut down on carbon emissions. Boris Johnson has announced that the UK would no longer finance coal mining or coal-fired power plants abroad. Newsnight’s investigation found all of UKEF's current fossil fuel financing was for oil and gas projects, and not coal. It also found that - since 2010 - UKEF has financed £6bn of fossil fuel projects. Financing has been provided to some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world. James Clayton investigates.

And while there’s little doubt that climate change is to blame, proving that fault for specific weather events hasn’t really been possible… until now. » Subscribe to Seeker! http://bit.ly/subscribeseeker » Watch more Elements! http://bit.ly/ElementsPlaylist » Visit our shop at http://shop.seeker.com An emerging field called extreme-event attribution is helping us measure and verify the relationship between the climate crisis and extreme weather. Not only does this have huge implications for predicting and modeling our planet’s future, but it could also help us better prepare for living in an increasingly extreme world. When we talk about the impacts of the climate crisis, we’re really talking about distinguishing the influence of natural factors from anthropogenic factors on Earth’s climate cycle. Basically, this means teasing apart Earth’s natural climate cycles from human-caused climate change. A way to begin doing this is to examine the “fingerprints” we humans have left behind on Earth’s climate. By matching both the observed and modeled patterns of Earth’s climate, scientists can positively identify the “fingerprints'' associated with these changes. Following the tracks of these fingerprints has helped scientists link climate change with more general trends, like rising sea levels and global temperatures. #climatechange #environment #naturaldisasters #weather #science #seeker #elements Read More: The Decade of Attribution Science https://slate.com/technology/2019/12/attribution-science-field-explosion-2010s-climate-change.html ""Just as medical researchers can study how smoking cigarettes changes people’s risk of lung cancer by comparing data from smokers and nonsmokers, attribution scientists compare events on our planet with those on a hypothetical “Planet B,” one that is untouched by greenhouse gas emissions.""

Joe Biden's climate change plan is a surprisingly progressive agenda. Climate justice and climate mitigation are headliners of Joe Biden's climate plan, and the Green New Deal is even mentioned in Biden's climate plan. Compared to Joe Biden, Donald Trump has no climate plan, and a Donald Trump presidency could spell climate change disaster. The Trump White House has spent the last year dismantling countless pieces of environmental and climate change legislation. Unfortunately U.S. election system really only provides two choices: Donald Trump vs Joe Biden. And in this 2020 election, where climate change is a crucial issue, voting for Joe Biden is the better vote for climate action.

Consequently, encouraging human ingenuity and individual action in order to protect our world. Dr James Rae is a climate scientist in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews. His research uses the chemistry of sediments, ice, and fossils to reconstruct past climate change. He’s particularly interested in the drivers of the ice ages, the climates of the dinosaurs, and reconstructing CO2 over geological time. Before coming to St Andrews, James held a prestigious NOAA Climate and Global Change fellowship at Caltech, and studied at the Universities of Bristol and Oxford. In 2015, James won the European Geosciences Union Outstanding Young Scientist Award in Biogeochemistry, for his contributions to understanding past climate change and its causes.

Over and over again. And far too many leaders have refused to listen. And far too few have acted with the vision the science demands.” He said noted that “as climate change intensifies, we will find it harder to feed ourselves” causing “more and more people will be forced to migrate from their homes as the land they depend on becomes less able to support them.” He added that “this is already leading to local conflicts over dwindling resources.” Guterres called on governments, businesses, scientists and that will put the planet on a path to a better future. He said “the commitments made so far by Parties to the Paris Agreement represent just one-third of what is needed. The mountain in front of us is very high. But it is not insurmountable. We know how to scale it. Put simply, we need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action.” Guterres also outlined his vision for a new Climate Summit in 2019, which he will be convening to rally the international community, to step up action in key areas inclusive sustainable energy production, economic growth, green investment and better stewardship of natural resources. He said, “enormous benefits await humankind if we can rise to the climate challenge” and added that the argument that tackling climate change is expensive and could harm economic growth “is hogwash.” In fact, he said “the opposite is true.” The call for greater ambition on climate action comes amid record temperature rises and extreme weather events across the globe. The last few months alone saw devastating floods in southern India, wildfires in the United States and extreme heatwaves in Japan. Guterres said, “we stand at an existential crossroad. If we are to take the right path – the only sensible path -- we will have to muster the full force of human ingenuity” and stressed that “technology is on our side in the battle to address climate change.” He pointed out that “the transition to a cleaner, greener future needs to speed up” and said that infrastructure investment must be “sustainable or we will lock in a high-polluting dangerous future.” Guterres said “every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants -- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth. Our fate is in our own hands. The world is counting on all of us to rise to the challenge before it’s too late.” When world leaders signed the historic Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, they pledged to stop temperatures rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and as close to 1.5 degrees, as possible. But scientists and a major UN study, indicate that the target is already well off-track. The UN chief’s message also comes ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit, to be held on the west coast of the United States, in San Francisco, from 12-14 September. National, regional and municipal leaders will gather with business people and philanthropic communities to underscore their commitment to climate action.

This report has been prepared for the UK Government by the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change. www.theccc.org.uk/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017 Script Climate change is a global problem. The world is already around a degree warmer than it was, due to extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activity. Scientists have warned for some time that a temperature rise of two degrees or more risks severe and potentially irreversible changes to our planet. 2016 is set to be the warmest year ever recorded. If so, it will be the third record warmest year in a row. Last year’s historic Paris Agreement was an important step towards tackling this. But the effects of climate change are already being felt in the UK. Average temperatures are increasing and there is a trend towards milder winters and hotter summers. We can also expect more frequent floods, like those we’ve seen in recent years. And there are plenty of other challenges on the horizon. Which is why the Committee on Climate Change has carried out a comprehensive, scientific assessment of the risks and opportunities for the UK. The climate change risk assessment is the result of more than three years of work, involving hundreds of leading scientists, and experts from both the public and private sectors. It shows that the greatest threats to the UK come from periods of too much or too little water, increasing average and extreme seasonal temperatures, and rising sea levels. Action is needed to tackle six key risks: The increasing chance of more severe and widespread flooding. Risks to public health from higher temperatures, including in overheating homes. A risk of shortages in public water supplies, and scarce water for farming. A threat to nature including loss of native species. Food price spikes and potential disruption to UK and global food production. And risks from new and emerging pests and diseases affecting people, animals and plants. The longer action is delayed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and adapt to the changes, the higher the costs and risks will be. Climate change is happening now. This new UK risk assessment identifies where more effort is necessary, and urgent, to address these risks. It’s time to act.	climate change,UK,climate risks,greenhouse gases,adaptation,flooding,drought,overheating,pests,diseases,food,farming,health,infrastructure,business,industry,Paris,UNFCCC,water	28	Science & Technology	PT2M31S	151	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SDxmlvGiV9k/maxresdefault.jpg		36267			0		climate crisis	False	0

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our diets account for one-fourth of those emissions. The food we eat emits so many greenhouse emissions because of the land it takes to grow it, but it also has something to do with biology. This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer.

According to one estimate, natural disasters caused about $340 billion in damage across the world in 2017. And insurers had to pay out a record $138 billion. The $5 trillion global insurance industry plays a huge role in the U.S. economy. Insurance spending in 2017 made up about 11 percent of America’s GDP. So, how will insurance companies remain profitable in an era of climate change? And what does that mean for the rest of us? Natural disasters cost the country $91 billion in 2018, according to a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report's findings are a sign that the changing climate and increasing numbers of extreme weather events are having a significant economic impact, even as the Trump administration continues to undo Obama-era climate regulations. The economic losses in 2018 were due to 14 different natural disasters, ranging from hurricanes to wildfires to winter storms. Eighty percent, or $73 billion, of the total loss was attributable to just three events: Hurricane Michael in Florida, Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas, and wildfires in the West, including California. According to the report, 2018 had the fourth-highest total costs from natural disasters since NOAA started tracking this data in 1980. It also marked the eighth consecutive year with eight or more natural disasters that cost at least $1 billion each. Last year set a new record for wildfire costs, with $24 billion in losses caused by several fires throughout the summer and fall. November's Camp Fire burned over 150,000 acres in northern California alone, destroying homes and businesses. Since 1980, the U.S. has sustained over $1.6 trillion in losses due to natural disasters. The Trump administration has been historically resistant to take action on climate change. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement during his first year in office. The president has dismissed reports on the effects of climate change and mocked the concept of global warming during recent winter storms. ""Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold,"" Trump tweeted last month.

How has coronavirus impacted climate change? Can methods used to track climate change be used to track the spread of coronavirus? We explore these topics and a lot more. Our first guest is Gavin Schmidt, PhD, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. To start, we get a little background on CO2 emissions. How has the air quality changed over the current quarantined period? You’ll learn how the decrease of car and air travel have impacted our climate. We explore how climate modeling is similar to modeling the spread of coronavirus. You’ll also learn the benefits of “simple” vs “complex” modeling. Gavin tells us why models are fundamental to scientific enterprise. Then we welcome our second guest, Katharine Hayhoe, PhD, director of the Climate Center at Texas Tech University. She also has her own YouTube channel called @Global Weirding with Katharine Hayhoe. Katharine explains how coronavirus made the jump from animals to humans (zoonosis) and why this is not the first, or last, time it will happen. You’ll hear why the current pandemic is like a microcosm of climate change. We investigate the role that government has played in this pandemic so far and what governments can learn from dealing with this situation. Katharine explains how this pandemic and climate change are similar in the fact that they both impact the poorest people the hardest. We take a look at the spread of conspiracy theories during this pandemic and how they come from the same places that spread climate change conspiracies. Lastly, you’ll also hear about climatefeedback.org, a website run by a network of scientists to bring you truthful climate change news. All that, plus, Katharine shares a hopeful message for the future. =================================== About the prints that flank Neil in this video: ""Black Swan” & ""White Swan"" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston.

Help me make more videos like this via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OurChangingClimate In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how we’ve responded globally to the Coronavirus in order to understand how we should and could respond to climate change. Specifically, I look at how countries like China, South Korea, Singapore, Italy, and the United States have quickly mounted large governmental responses to the coronavirus. Covid-19 is a serious global and political crisis, but the coronavirus shows us that rapid behavioral and structural change is possible in the face of a crisis, and climate change is a crisis. The response to Coronavirus (Covid-19) has been quick and broad, the response to climate has been slow and small. If we treated climate change like we have Covid-19, also known as the coronavirus, we would be well on our way to zero-carbon future.

But with climate skeptics (and their allies in industry and government) thwarting conservationists’ efforts, some scientists are working to develop a back-up plan: using technology to “geoengineer” the Earth's atmosphere and reduce the impacts of climate change. But geoengineering is seen by some as a distraction from the real challenge of climate change in much of the scientific community. Critics say it's a solution that diverts attention away from the real challenge, which is finding a way for the world to drastically reduce the amount of man-made carbon that its pumping into the atmosphere. Shane Smith and Ben Anderson took an in-depth look at how this technology would work — and how effective this radical (and potentially dangerous) plan could be.

A leading climate scientist helps sort fact from fiction and stresses the importance of adapting to an uncertain future. Linda Mortsch has devoted her career to addressing climate change issues. Since 1989, she has played a role in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and is a co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. In 1992, her research project “Adapting to climate variability and change in the Great Lakes Basin” was one of the first to explore adaptation to climate change in Canada. Today, Linda has an adjunct appointment in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo, and has been recognized by a number of associations, including the International Joint Commission, American Geophysical Union, Environment Canada, and more.

The current generation of high school and college-aged young adults is the first that has grown up with an awareness of climate change and its potential consequences.  How does this generation perceive climate change and its own future given that perception? How does education in climate change alter those perceptions? This talk examines the perception of climate change, its potential consequences on the future of high school students (age 16-18) before and after being educated on the evidence, and mitigation strategies of climate change. Bio: Mr. Isaac is a lifelong educator. His life path has taken him on a wild ride from working as a sailing instructor to banker; to “working” as a stay at home dad, firefighter, and EMT to finally finding and fulfilling his passion in high school science education. Strident about the education of young minds, project-based learning, and earth and space sciences, Mr. Isaac strives to get young minds to open to the amazing world around them: “Get your head out of your phone,” he admonishes them. Mr. Isaac, the oldest faculty member at South Fayette High School, has been teaching for only seven years. He enjoys the responsibility and latitude of being the old guy that never follows the rules.

The arctic has been warming up for years - and now, the warnings of experts and scientists are clear for everyone to see - the poles are melting. As the differences in temperature between the poles and the equatore reduce, the jetstream winds, which move weather around the globe - are slowing down. The result - extreme weather. High- and low pressure systems remain at the same spot for longer, creating floods and droughts.

Don't miss Vox's Game of Thrones coverage: https://www.vox.com/game-of-thrones Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO The White Walkers are some of Thrones’ creepiest villains — but they also help tell a really interesting metaphor about climate change. For starters, the White Walkers are a threat to all humanity: Their zombie minions are equally happy to rip apart people of all nations and noble houses. Yet instead of uniting to combat the shared threat to human existence, the houses in the show spend basically all their time on their own petty disagreements and struggle for power. White Walkers are generally ignored; some nobles deny their existence outright. Swap climate change for White Walkers and ""countries"" for noble houses, and it starts to sound a lot like the real world. Specifically, it sounds like the problem of international coordination on climate change. No one country can prevent catastrophic warming on its own: Every country that's a major greenhouse gas emitter is part of the problem.

""XR"" demonstrators have staged spectacular acts of civil disobedience as part of their effort to persuade politicians to take action to reduce global warming. Extinction Rebellion was founded two years ago, and has achieved remarkable success since then. In Germany alone, there are 120 local XR groups and a total of about 20,000 members. The small town of Stroud in southwest England is considered the movement's birthplace. For years, Stroud has been a center of environmental activism in Britain and it is where the founding members live. One of them is Skeena Rathor -- a mother of three who says that she's prepared to go to jail for her beliefs. Another is Gail Bradbrook, who is not above damaging public and private property during protests. Extinction Rebellion activists have paralyzed traffic and chained themselves to fences outside businesses and government offices as part of their demonstrations. One of the co-founders of Extinction Rebellion is Roger Hallam, whose radical activism has sparked controversy. In September 2019, Hallam was arrested and charged with using drones to try to disrupt air traffic at Heathrow Airport. He's also been accused of making comments that appeared to downplay the significance of the Holocaust which led Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany and Britain to distance themselves from Hallam’s statements. XR demands that governments declare a climate- and ecological emergency, and take decisive action to protect the environment. The organization continues to recruit new members, and to prepare them for taking part in acts of non-violent civil disobedience. Extinction Rebellion appears to be politically neutral. Its supporters range from the far left to the far right. But this diversity of views could lead to potentially disruptive policy disputes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She discusses the impacts of climate change on her home country, Honduras, and how she discovered the intersections between these two issues. Far too often we talk about the effect of climate change on the planet, and she wants to change the narrative and talk about how it will impact the most marginalized communities around the world. Adriana is a fourth year student in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. She's originally from Honduras, in Central America and is passionate about social justice, climate change and food security. She's a member of Love Intersections, a group of queer, people of colour who believe that story telling is a powerful agent of change. She's been very involved with sustainability initiatives at UBC and currently works for AMS Sustainability.

We made this difficult decision for the TED Archive because we believe that a well-moderated conversation allows for better commentary from more people and more viewpoints. Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once.

Climate change is arguably the greatest challenge of our time. Human activity has already warmed the planet by one degree Celsius relative to pre-industrial times, and we are feeling the effects through record heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, the planet will reach two degrees of warming by 2050 - the threshold that many scientists have identified as a dangerous tipping point. What is the science behind these projections? Join climate scientist expert Michael Mann to learn about the basic scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. We need to understand the science in order to solve the broader environmental, societal and economic changes that climate change is bringing. By the end of this course, you will: -Develop a deep scientific understanding of HOW the climate system has been changing; -Articulate WHY the climate system is changing; -Understand the nature of these changes; -Develop a systems thinking approach to analyzing the impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems.	edX,edx.org,free online courses,free courses online,free courses,free classes,online classes,online courses free,online college courses,online college classes,free online classes,education,free education,online education,massive open online course,MOOC,MOOC courses,online learning,lifelong learning,free online learning,free university courses,MIT online courses,distance learning,distance education,certificates,free college courses,Harvard,MIT	27	Education	PT2M15S	135	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vP00TP6-p0/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	5320	78.0	29.0	0	3.0	climate crisis	False	0

The coronavirus brought much of the world to a standstill, dropping carbon emissions by five percent. Al Gore says keeping those rates down is now up to us. In this illuminating interview, he discusses how the steadily declining cost of wind and solar energy will transform manufacturing, transportation and agriculture, offer a cheaper alternative to fossil fuels and nuclear energy and create millions of new jobs. Stay tuned for a lively debate about geoengineering and hear Gore's thoughts about how humanity can create a clean, prosperous future through a focused global effort and a generation of young people committed to change.

But is this power of scientific truth working for climate change? Kenneth Van den Bergh, owner of a non-profit dedicated to climate change and a researcher at the KU Leuven in the Energy & Environment group, will explore this question with you. Kenneth Van den Bergh is a co-founder of Carbon+Alt+Delete. Carbon+Alt+Delete is a non-profit organization with the mission to mitigate climate change by informing and activating people. Carbon+Alt+Delete offers a user-friendly tool to calculate carbon emissions. Besides, people can compensate their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects. Kenneth holds a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, a MSc in Energy Engineering and a MSc in Management, all from the KU Leuven.

So should we!’ — 2019 was the year young people around the world stood up and demanded real climate action. These were the key moments for the youth climate movement. » Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe » Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThis This video was created in partnership with Emerson Collective https://www.emersoncollective.com. In US news and current events today, NowThis News is looking back on the biggest moments of the year in climate activism and the fight against climate change. This is how young climate crisis activists changed the world. One of the biggest moments of the year was when teen climate activist and Fridays for Future founder Greta Thunberg spoke at the United Nations. This became known as the Greta Thunberg How Dare You speech and launched many Greta Thunberg How Dare You memes and GIFs. Thunberg launched one of the biggest climate strikes, the global school strike 4 climate. In the fight against global warming one of the biggest global issues today also referred to as the climate crisis, no action was too small. These activists are leading the fight against the climate crisis 2020. #GretaThunberg #Weather #Science #Climate #Youth #News #NowThis #NowThisNews Connect with NowThis » Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook » Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter » Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram » Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_Snapchat NowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.

Animated film. Length: 5'42"" The impacts of climate change destroy people's livelihoods and homes. They damage our infrastructure and disrupt communication and trade. Moreover, climate change is endangering development successes and the poor and marginalized are often affected the most. Even if we were to stop emissions instantly, the world would not stop warming immediately due to the amount of gases we have already emitted. That's why we must do both: reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to inevitable climate change. But how can we adapt, considering that the precise extent and form of climate change aren't known?

Academics call this ""shifting baseline syndrome"" -- the idea that environmental change happens too slowly to trip our alarm bells. Journalist and filmmaker John D. Sutter is directing a longitudinal film series -- BASELINE -- that aims to be an antidote by documenting four locations on the frontlines of change every five years, until 2050. John D. Sutter is an EMMY-nominated documentary filmmaker who is directing “Baseline,” a film series that tells the story of the climate crisis beyond a human lifetime. He is an Explorer with the National Geographic Society, where he is developing the “Baseline” project. Sutter spent 10 years as a reporter, columnist and producer at CNN, most recently as a senior investigative reporter. He continues to work for CNN as a climate analyst. Sutter’s work has twice been nominated for an EMMY — for science reporting and new approaches to documentary. He is the recipient of the Livingston Award for Young Journalists, the Peabody Award, the Batten Medal for Public Service, the Foreign Press Association Media Award and the Edward R. Murrow Award, among others. He’s a former fellow at Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism and at UnionDocs, a center for documentary art in Brooklyn.

Climate change is THE existential question that humanity is facing. But are we too late? Has climate change reached the point of no return? Are we doomed? TEACHERS: Get your students in the discussion on KQED Learn, a safe place for middle and high school students to investigate controversial topics and share their voices. ABOVE THE NOISE is a show that cuts through the hype and investigates the research behind controversial and trending topics in the news. Hosted by Myles Bess. *NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY* SUBSCRIBE by clicking the RED BUTTON above. Follow us on Instagram @kqedabovethenoise **What's the state of climate change right now?** Since around 1880, the average global temperature of the earth has increased by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That increase is due almost entirely to humans burning fossil fuels, mostly from 1950 on. That might not sound like a big increase, but it is. It means sea level rise, shrinking polar ice caps, and increased extreme weather events like heat waves and monsoons. That's why a hundred and ninety-plus countries signed onto the Paris Climate Agreement. The goal is to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- by the end of this century. Many scientists say that staying under 1.5 puts us near the upper limit of what's tolerable. We'll have droughts, sea level rise, and extreme weather, but chances are we can manage it. **What does climate change look like in the future?** That's why we have the IPCC. The IPCC is part of the United Nations, and it stands for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It's been the world's top authority on climate science for the last 30 years. Thousands of climate scientists from around the world volunteer their time to analyze and summarize the latest and best climate science. According to these experts, if we keep burning fossil fuels like we are today, then we're blowing past 1.5 degrees of warming by 2100. We'll almost definitely hit 2 degrees, and might even reach 3 or even 4 degrees. That means longer and more intense heat waves. And stronger hurricanes and dangerous flooding. **How do we get climate change under control?** Let's start with transportation. 95% of the vehicles on the planet burn fossil fuels. They're responsible for almost ⅓ of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide! It might sound like a pipe-dream to replace those gas-guzzlers with electric vehicles, but it might not be. In the last decade and a half electric vehicles that don't have any pollution out of the tailpipe went from a dream to commonplace in places like California, China, Norway. Then we have the energy sector -- think power plants. In 2016, 80% of the world's energy came from fossil fuels, while only 5% came from renewables like solar and wind. But we're seeing that change. Now solar is the cheapest form of energy in just two decades. That's a huge change. And then there's how we use land. We're cutting down WAY too many trees and using a lot of that land to raise livestock that we end up eating. The United Nations estimates that if the world stopped getting food from animal sources, greenhouse gas emissions could be cut by one-fourth. SOURCES: Climate Change: How Do We Know?

"Be one of the first 200 people to sign up with this link and get 20% off your subscription with Brilliant.org! https://brilliant.org/OCC/ In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what you can do about climate change using individual, personal, and collective actions. This video, however, is not a simple list of the best things a person can do to change their lifestyle and shrink their carbon footprint, instead I start by looking at the way in which we’ve globally become fixated on individual solutions to climate change. We envision ourselves more as consumers than as citizens. As a result carbon footprint related actions like flying less, zero waste, and recycling are prioritized over voting, protesting, and system change. This video is all about doing both personal things to lower your carbon footprint like driving less, but simultaneously acting collectively to create a system in which having a small carbon footprint is feasible for everyone. Structural change and individual change are both necessary to stop climate change.

Written, directed and animated by Miritte Ben Yitzchak and voiced by British actress Keira Knightley, it urges us all to Act Now before it is too late. The animated short Climate Crisis, and Why We Should Panic, is the second of a two-part explainer video series for Extinction Rebellion, focusing on the climate and ecological crisis. Voiced by Keira Knightley, it explains what’s causing climate change, why governments must enter crisis mode to tackle this issue, and what will happen if we don’t do something about it now. It follows the first part - Extinction Emergency, and Why We Must Act Now - which focuses on the ecological crisis. Voiced by Naomie Harris and scored by Brian Eno, it summarises the planet’s biodiversity loss, runaway consumerism and the ecological crisis that now faces us, and how the consequences will affect millions of lives around the world.

Trees are burning up around the planet at an alarming rate and impacting the climate. Now a new effort to plant as many trees as possible has taken hold around the globe. But will it mitigate climate change? In California, 3 million acres have burned since 2017. And in Brazil, some 121,000 fires have burned since January — more than half in the Amazon rainforest. The fires have cost the planet millions of trees, one of the Earth’s best defenses against climate change. Now a movement around the globe is trying to replace trees lost to fire and deforestation for agriculture or grazing. In Ethiopia, the prime minister announced a new #GreenLegacy initiative that planted more than 353 million trees in 12 hours. Even YouTube stars are getting in on the act: More than 600 social media personalities recently raised over $16 million to plant trees worldwide. The effort was led by Jimmy Donaldson, a YouTube star who’s also known as MrBeast. Reforestation is also a big part of the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. recently abandoned at the behest of President Donald Trump. But can planting billions and billions of trees really mitigate climate change? For that matter, is it even feasible? » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country.” He was speaking before the US Congress to confront the defining issue of his time – slavery. Everyone knew it had to end but no one had the political will to stop it. Remarkably, his words ring as true today when applied to the defining crisis of our time – Climate Change. As a UN Messenger of Peace, I have traveled all over the world for the last two years documenting how this crisis is changing the natural balance of our planet. I have seen cities like Beijing choked by industrial pollution. Ancient Boreal forests in Canada that have been clear cut and rainforests in Indonesia that have been incinerated. In India, I met farmers whose crops have literally been washed away by historic flooding. In America, I have witnessed unprecedented droughts in California and sea level rise flooding the streets of Miami. In Greenland and in the Arctic I was astonished to see that ancient glaciers are rapidly disappearing well ahead of scientific predictions. All that I have seen and learned on this journey has absolutely terrified me. There is no doubt in the world’s scientific community that this a direct result of human activity and that the effects of climate change will become astronomically worse in the future. You know that climate change is happening faster than even the most pessimistic of scientists warned us decades ago. It has become a runaway freight train bringing with it an impending disaster for all living things. Now think about the shame that each of us will carry when our children and grandchildren look back and realize that we had the means of stopping this devastation, but simply lacked the political will to do so. Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Massive change is required, now. One that leads to a new collective consciousness. A new collective evolution of the human race, inspired and enabled by a sense of urgency from all of you. We all know that reversing the course of climate change will not be easy, but the tools are in our hands – if we apply them before it is too late. Now is the time for bold unprecedented action. It is time to ask each other – which side of history will you be on? As a citizen of our planet, it is time to declare no more talk. No more excuses. No more ten-year studies. No more allowing the fossil fuel companies to manipulate and dictate the science and policies that affect our future. Lincoln’s words still resonate to all of us here today:“We will be remembered in spite of ourselves. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last generation… We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.” That is our charge now – you are the last best hope of Earth. We ask you to protect it. Or we – and all living things we cherish – are history."" - Leonardo DiCaprio ► For more Inspirational Videos: http://blog.goalcast.life/epic-motivational-videos/ ► Subscribe To Our Channel Here: https://goo.gl/wTKGC4 Don't forget to share this video to spread the inspiration! ========================================­­­­­­­======== FOLLOW US: Facebook: https://goo.gl/cjShXM Instagram: https://goo.gl/XaukHK Twitter: https://goo.gl/WBe30b Website: http://www.goalcast.life ========================================­­­­­­­======== BACKGROUND MUSIC by Fearless Motivation Instrumentals: AppleMusic/iTunes: https://goo.gl/2mF7gr Spotify: https://goo.gl/Uxmswh AmazonMP3: http://geni.us/BackgroundMusic MP3 Downloads: https://teamfearless.com/mp3-downloads/background-music/"	motivation,inspirational,quotes,motivational speech,motivational quotes,leonardo Dicaprio,climate change,green,global warming	24	Entertainment	PT3M53S	233	2d	hd	True	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F47RIF_0reA/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	176944	2945.0	73.0	0	172.0	climate crisis	False	0

It's a weather cycle that's prompted a number of climate change deniers — including President Trump — to crack tired jokes about the concept of global warming. But beyond the misguided social media jabs lies a serious and ongoing discussion about how scientists can connect individual extreme weather events to underlying climate change — and more importantly, how fast they can make now those connections. Remember that study from 2004? It looked at a European heat wave that took place in 2003, and took a year and a half to complete. In contrast, just three months after Hurricane Harvey, scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published a study showing that Harvey dropped 38 percent more rain than it would have without underlying climate change. Another group called World Weather Attribution found that hurricanes that size have become three times more probable VICE News spoke with Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford and one of the researchers behind the first climate attribution study, who explained why scientists are now able to rapidly figure out if an event like Hurricane Harvey was more devastating than it otherwise would have been because of climate change. (Answer: it was.) ""We are now looking at accelerating that whole process because once you've agreed on the method you're using, you don't need to reinvent the wheel every time you do a new study,"" Allen told VICE News. ""The actual time it takes to actually do the calculations is not that long."" This segment originally aired January 3, 2018 on VICE News Tonight on HBO.

Take action on climate change at http://countdown.ted.com. The global climate crisis will require us to transform the way we act, says His Holiness Pope Francis. Delivering a visionary TED Talk from Vatican City, the spiritual leader proposes three courses of action to address the world’s growing environmental problems and economic inequalities, illustrating how all of us can work together, across faiths and societies, to protect the Earth and promote the dignity of everyone. “The future is built today,” he says. “And it is not built in isolation, but rather in community and in harmony.” This talk was part of the Countdown Global Launch on 10.10.2020.

How could spraying chemicals into the stratosphere help counteract global warming? Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 What if you discovered a way to cool down the planet? Extreme weather events are becoming more common and more ferocious. As the surface temperature of earth continues to rise, so too will the ferocity of natural disasters. In 2018 scientists will take bold steps to explore a technology that could reverse the effects of climate-change. They’re looking at ways to reflect sunlight back into space and cool down the planet. Insurers say the number of weather-related disasters has quadrupled since 1970. While world leaders are debating and disputing climate-change and the ways in which humans alter their behaviour on earth, some scientists discuss changes to the earth itself. In 2018, they’ll take to the stratosphere to learn what it might take – or cost – to cool the planet directly. Geoengineering is the pioneering science that could well be on everyone’s lips in 2018. The team from Harvard University is the first in the world to test the effects solar geoengineering might have in the stratosphere. The experiments in 2018 won’t impact the climate, but if one day implemented, this controversial intervention could help curb extreme weather events. Solar geoengineering has the potential to save lives, but it also poses unknown risks. And there are fears that merely researching geoengineering might be detrimental to the long-term fight against climate-change. Some environmentalists say that the drive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions could be lost if there’s seen to be a quick fix. And deciding who controls a technology that affects everyone on the planet won’t be easy. Ultimately solar geoengineering could prove a risk not worth taking. But ignoring it now could be even more dangerous. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

We reached that goal in April 2020, and we’re certainly proud that our facilities, corporate emissions, and corporate travel don’t contribute carbon to the planet. We use 100 percent renewable electricity, and we’ve invested in the restoration of forests, wetlands, and grasslands to remove carbon naturally. However, all of this is just a starting point. We have an entirely different goal in mind. It’s kind of an audacious plan. By 2030 our whole carbon footprint — from manufacturing to transportation to end-of-life material recovery — will be nonexistent. All of Apple will be 100 percent carbon neutral. To do that, we’ll be using renewable energy and recycled materials throughout our supply chain. We’ll be restoring natural ecosystems around the world. And we’ll reuse as much as we can. While designing the world’s most innovative products, we’re also designing a sustainable manufacturing process. To really get to carbon zero while making products people all over the world love — a lot of people might say that’s impossible. We say it won’t be. Keep an eye on us and see.

India has witnessed droughts, floods, low yields, high temperature, erratic rains. But are we responsible for it? Or are we victims, paying the price for the development trajectory of other rich countries? Is it fair to ask India to cut its greenhouse gas emissions, which may come at the cost of development? Or is there a way to bridge the development and environment binary? How has India’s international stance evolved? To discuss a range of these issues, Navroz Dubash, editor of the most comprehensive book on climate change and India, joins this edition of The Big Picture.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO We know that humanity's carbon footprint has shifted the baseline conditions of the climate, the context in which every weather event takes place. But trying to isolate the human influence from everything else that is going on can be really hard, especially for hurricanes, or what scientists call ""tropical cyclones."" They're super complex and the quality of the historical data we have for them isn't great. We do have physics, though. Hurricanes are driven by the transfer of heat from the sea to the air through evaporation. The storm's maximum possible wind speed, or its potential intensity, depends in part on how warm the ocean is – and of course, we're warming the ocean. So researchers expect intense tropical cyclones to become frequent if we continue to warm the planet. The hurricanes of the future will also be wetter. So coastal cities will face freshwater flooding from the sky paired with storm surge from the sea, which is higher now because we are also causing sea levels to rise. And that trend of wetter storms isn't just for hurricanes. Heavy precipitation events from other types of storms have been increasing in The US and should continue to increase across the country. Even in places that might see less rain over the whole year, they'll get more days with really heavy precipitation. This comes down to basic physics too: warmer air can take up more water before it dumps it back down on us. All of this means global warming worsens floods like the kind that hit Houston. But it's not our destiny to hurt ourselves like this. It depends on what we choose to do now. We could rethink our infrastructure and regulations to minimize the damage, but unless we also start cutting our carbon emissions and shifting the world to clean energy, it's just going to get worse.

Here's How We Adapt | Alice Bows-Larkin | TED Talks	Imagine the hottest day you've ever experienced. Now imagine it's six, 10 or 12 degrees hotter. According to climate researcher Alice Bows-Larkin, that's the type of future in store for us if we don't significantly cut our greenhouse gas emissions now. She suggests that it's time we do things differently—a whole system change, in fact—and seriously consider trading economic growth for climate stability.

According to Chomsky, this massive public relations campaign has succeeded in leading a good portion of the population into doubting the human causes of global warming. Known for his criticism of the media, Chomsky doesn't hold back in this clip, laying blame on mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times, which will run frontpage articles on what meteorologists think about global warming. ""Meteorologists are pretty faces reading scripts telling you whether it's going to rain tomorrow,"" Chomsky says. ""What do they have to say any more than your barber?"" All this is part of the media's pursuit of ""fabled objectivity."" Of particular concern for Chomsky is the atmosphere of anger, fear and hostility that currently reigns in America. The public's hatred of Democrats, Republicans, big business and banks and the public's distrust of scientists all lead to general disregard for the findings of ""pointy-headed elitists."" The 2010 elections could be interpreted as a ""death knell for the species"" because most of the new Republicans in Congress are global warming deniers. ""If this was happening in some small country,"" Chomsky concludes, ""it wouldn't matter much. But when it's happening in the richest, most powerful country in the world, it's a danger to the survival of the species.""

What is Climate Change? Do you know the facts? No? Well I personally had no idea. One day it just hit me, I knew very little about climate change. Even with a useless degree in chemistry, climate change is a confusing mess of strange and difficult to understand information. I made this video to gather all the facts I could find about climate change, in a fun way, and without any bias on my part. I wanted anyone who watched this video (and myself too!) to understand all the important facts relating to climate change. Non-scientists welcome. Science is exciting! It’s just school and most of our education systems aren’t… In a few months this video will be uploaded as to remove any language or scenes not suitable for schools, so it can be used to teach about climate change in schools.

Floods, cyclones and droughts are likely to increase as the Earth warms. Poor farmers are already trying to adapt. Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2Hea5EK Melting glaciers, droughts, rising sea-levels - these are just some of the environmental disruptions that are likely to worsen with climate change. But dangerous climate change is not just something that might happen in the future. The earth is already warmed by almost 1 degree Celsius since the dawn of the Industrial Age - the effects are already being felt now. Vulnerable communities are trying to adapt. Bangladesh is more at risk from climate change than almost any other country. It's prone to flooding, cyclones and drought. Climate change may already be exacerbating those things. Bangladesh sits at the bottom of a Delta plane were three main rivers converge. It's straddled by the melting Himalayan glaciers in the north and the rising waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south. That makes it highly susceptible to flooding. In 2009, cyclone Aila tore through Bangladesh, uprooting trees, flattening homes and destroying crops. Along the southern coastal regions the storm left behind salty water in areas it had inundated. Fields that had once support agriculture were deemed useless. To adapt to their newly saline environment, locals have had to change their source of food production. Through a project funded by the World Bank villagers have switched to raising crabs which thrive in saltwater. Villagers rear the crabs and sell them at a local market where they're then resold by buyers who shipped them to Dakha. Adding to this problem, in some areas farmers deliberately inundate their lands with salty water so they can farm shrimp rather than crops, which is more profitable but problematic for the environment. But the salinity creates another daunting problem - it pollutes local groundwater and makes it more difficult to access safe drinking water. Climate change is worsening this effect. Cyclones are more common, river flow has diminished, and salty water from the Bay of Bengal has been reaching ever farther into the coastal lands travelling up rivers and polluting freshwater supplies that are used for drinking and irrigation. NGOs working with the Community Climate Change Project has sought to address this problem. They've provided water tanks so locals can harvest rainwater and have helped fund a desalination plant that provides clean drinking water. In the north of the country, local livelihoods have also been threatened by water. Many villagers are beholden to the rivers. When the rivers flood, the soil used for agriculture has disappeared. Not only have they lost their homes and their crops but also their means of survival. In Ranpur, villagers have learned a new farming technique that works on sandbars or chars where all the soil has been eroded. Farmers dig out holes in the char fill them with compost and plant pumpkins. Pumpkins are preserved and can be sold during the rainy season providing income throughout the year. Adaptation projects such as the ones being carried out in Bangladesh have had a huge impact on those involved but Bangladesh is not the only place where the effects of climate change are already being felt and adapted to. Rotterdam is building floating pavilions to pilot a city that rises with its sea levels. London will improve the Thames Barrier so it can better protect the city from floods. A decade ago adaptation was almost taboo in international discussions about climate change because it was believed to distract attention from the vital task of stopping global warming altogether. Now those are recognized as important. But can keep them in poor countries like Bangladesh adapt quickly enough? We don't know yet. Richer countries are better able to withstand the potential shocks that climate change will bring. If change is slow enough, it gives people more time to act and increases the odds of success. World leaders tend to talk about stopping climate change. It would help poor farmers enormously if it could only be slowed down. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

Sandstorms are becoming more and more frequent, groundwater levels are sinking and palm trees are shrivelling up and dying. An age-old way of life is in danger. Halim Sbai says an oasis really is a paradise. But drought and desertification are now taking their toll on oases like M'hamid El Ghizlane in southeastern Morocco where he grew up. The survival of a whole region is at stake. Over hundreds of kilometers between the Anti-Atlas mountains and the Sahara desert there is one palm-fringed oasis after the next. Close to two million people live in these settlements. Up to now, many earned their living by harvesting dates from the palm trees. But this is proving more and more difficult. Decreasing and irregular rainfall is having a devastating impact on the trees and their yields. Halim Sbai is planting new palm trees and preserving as much precious water as he can in a bid to keep the oasis of M'hamid El Ghizlane and the region’s traditional way of life alive. Up to now, he has also been supplementing his income with earnings from tourism. Global warming could put an end to all this. ------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In reality, 97 percent of scientists agree that it is real and only 3 percent are skeptical. A sticking point for some is the estimated timeline, but as Columbia University professor Philip Kitcher points out, a 4-5 Celsius temperature increase that makes the planet uninhabitable is a disaster no matter when it happens. In this video, 9 experts (including professors, astronomers, authors, and historians) explain what climate change looks like, how humans have already and are continuing to contribute to it, how and why it has become politicized, and what needs to happen moving forward for real progress to be made. David Wallace-Wells, journalist and New America Foundation National Fellow, says that the main goal of climate action is not to win over the skeptical minority, but to ""make those people who are concerned but still fundamentally complacent about the issue to be really engaged in a way that they prioritize climate change in their politics and their voting and make sure that our leaders think of climate change as a first-order political priority."" Read David Wallace-Wells' latest book The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming at https://amzn.to/2CMDSGI ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSCRIPT: GINA MCCARTHY: Climate is always portrayed on newscasts as being some kind of big debate. You know, the big debate among the scientists is that 97 percent of them know it's happening and are really worried about it. Three percent are skeptical. That's not a balance. That's an overwhelming majority and that needs to drive the decision, especially in a democracy. BILL NYE: The more you think about it everybody, 97 percent of the world's scientists – not 97 percent of some institute that somebody started in a remote part of the world and is releasing press releases. Ninety-seven percent of the scientists in the world are very concerned about climate change. PHILIP KITCHER: Climate science is built on views about the atmosphere that have been developed very successfully and in a very rigorous way from the nineteenth century to the present. There isn't any doubt about the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect. There isn't really any doubt about the evidence behind the consensus that says we have contributed enormously to the warming effects that are now becoming apparent not only in the present but also from the record of the earth's average temperature. NYE: You can look at the graphs. You can study the stuff for yourself. If nothing else do this. Wherever you live, get access to the coldest temperature of each year for the last century. And unless you live in just very few places you will see the coldest temperature where you live has steadily increased. They'll be some dips. There'll be some ups, but overall you'll find it – and that's just one that almost everybody who has internet access can get those data, they're available. And just look at that one thing and you'll see the world's getting warmer everybody. MICHELLE THALLER: Now the reason our atmosphere is getting warmer and warmer and warmer is because we humans are putting lots of carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere. And this acts as what we call a greenhouse gas. Sunlight can get through the atmosphere, but the carbon dioxide traps it and it can't release itself back into space so it gets warmer and warmer over time. Carbon dioxide doesn't just warm the atmosphere. It also affects our oceans. When ocean water combines with carbon dioxide to create something called carbonic acid and it makes the oceans more and more acidic over time. And this is a really big problem for marine life. There are things like algae. The algae in the oceans are responsible for most of the oxygen that we breathe. And the algae are having trouble forming because of the higher acid levels in the ocean. So even if the one thing you solved was cooling the earth down, if we continue to put more and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere there will be other serious repercussions. We could end up killing the ocean life system, for example. NYE: The earth is getting warmer faster than it has ever gotten before and that's the problem. It's not that the world hasn't had more carbon dioxide. It's not that the world hasn't been warmer. The problem is the speed at which things are changing. We are inducing a sixth mass extinction event kind of by accident and we don't want to be the extinctee if I may coin...

I talk about the game's mechanics, the frequency of extreme weather events, and the knock-on effects on human behaviour in the game. In short, the game does a very good job, way beyond a crude depiction of global warming. Thanks to 2K and Firaxis for providing early access to the game! (1) See http://www.trillionthtonne.org/questions.html (2) As ever, SkepticalScience has your back: https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html (3) For a cool interactive report about how hurricanes have changed with anthropogenic climate change, see https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/changes-hurricanes (4) Note here that I'm talking about the mean 'waviness' of the jet stream, leading to more frequent and more intense outbreaks of Arctic air. The recent cold outbreak over North America was likely exacerbated by this effect, but not caused by it - the root cause was a SSW, which current science indicates was not made more likely due to climate change. (5) See e.g. http://oxfordre.com/climatescience/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228620.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228620-e-344 (6) Natural variability in the atmosphere is something of a politicized and so thorny topic. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hockey_Stick_and_the_Climate_Wars for an idea of why I didn't want to delve into this in detail. There are a few things which I didn't mention in the video because I recorded it in a great hurry. Here are three of them. Firstly the game only specifically addresses CO2 emissions rather than a multitude of gases such as methane - this is technically inaccurate but I can understand why they simplified it. Secondly I didn't talk about any quantitative aspects of X emissions equating to Y warming or Z sea ice loss as that would require a standardised unit of emissions in the game, which it doesn't provide! Besides, there's no reason to believe that all other geophysical parameters would be the same as our Earth, making any kind of quantitative analysis difficult at best (and, to be honest, not that interesting!). Lastly, arguably the most unrealistic part of the game is that all world leaders in it believe that climate change is a significant issue!

To tackle climate change, a global perspective is needed and this can be provided by satellites. Their data is key if we want to prepare ourselves for the consequences of climate change. While our Earth Explorers gather data to understand how our planet works and understand the impact that climate change and human activity are having on the planet, the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinels provide systematic data for environmental services that help adapt to and mitigate change.

In this thorough talk, Dr. Martin examines the intersections of climate change and racism, from who's at the table during policymaking, to which communities are effected by natural disasters, and which receive resources first. Incorporating multidisciplinary data and research, Dr. Martin proposes ways for us to scrutinize bias in ourselves, our workplaces, and our social groups. Dr. Atyia Martin is a Certified Emergency Manager with a diverse set of experiences in public health, emergency management, intelligence, and homeland security. Mayor Martin Walsh appointed her as the Chief Resilience Officer for the City of Boston as part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. In this role, she is responsible for leading the development and implementation of Boston’s Resilience Strategy. Boston will focus on advancing racial equity as the foundation of the Resilience Strategy process. Dr. Martin has served as adjunct faculty in the Master of Homeland Security at Northeastern University. She was previously the Director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the Boston Public Health Commission. Her previous professional experience includes the Boston Police Department’s Boston Regional Intelligence Center; City of Boston’s Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management; the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI); and active duty Air Force assigned to the National Security Agency.

Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. ""Today is climate day at the White House and, which means that today is jobs day at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor,"" Biden said at the outset of his remarks at a signing ceremony. ""We're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water cleaner air and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security."" He continued: ""It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer."" The executive order on oil and natural gas leases directs the interior secretary to launch a ""rigorous review"" of the existing leasing and permitting programs related to fossil fuel development, and to identify steps to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. The halting of new leases fulfills a campaign promise by Biden and will expand an existing 60-day moratorium issued by the President on his first day in office. Biden's climate actions mark a sharp departure from the Trump administration's efforts to maximize fossil fuel production and expand oil and gas drilling on federal lands but climate emissaries for the administration emphasized they hope to build new job opportunities out of the changes. White House climate czar Gina McCarthy described the order as one that ""directs everyone who works for the President to use every tool available at our disposal to solve the climate crisis. Because we're going to take a whole of government approach."" #CNN #News #ClimateChange"	latest News,Happening Now,CNN,joe biden,climate change,climate crisis,us news,politics,science	25	News & Politics	PT20M46S	1246	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_4uy_mggrs/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	328132	6894.0	2764.0	0	7838.0	climate crisis	False	0

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

As the economic costs of disasters rise, can the insurance industry cope with the losses? Read more https://econ.st/2ndFMZ3 Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Extreme weather events like these are becoming more frequent. It’s not just causing untold human suffering but also ever-growing economic costs. As the losses pile up, will insurers be able to cope with the damage? In 2017 Hurricane Harvey, mudslides in Sierra Leone, and monsoon floods in South Asia all contributed to the largest year on record for insurance losses - with payouts totalling $144bn. In America for example between 1980 and 2015 you had about five events a year that each cost more than $1bn in damage. Since 2016 it’s been an average of 15 events like this a year. This leaves the insurance industry uniquely exposed and having to pay out a lot of money all at once. Insurers aren’t helped by the obsolete information they rely on either. They find it hard to predict when this happens because their models are not really taking into account climate change. They look at maybe 30, 40 years of data and they assume that the environment within these data, this period, is pretty stable. So these models look at a world that doesn’t really exist anymore. And it’s no surprise what’s now happening to the price of insurance. If you look at the last quarter premiums on property insurance in America rose by 10%. In Australia and New Zealand they rose by about 18%. And at some point premiums may simply become unaffordable especially so as disasters regularly happen in places where people can least afford to pay high premiums. Half of last year’s losses from natural disasters were uninsured. And in America 85% of homeowners have no flood insurance even though half of the population lives near water. Increasing premiums might just lead to even more people being left out in the cold. But there are some more novel solutions. So, for example, Lloyd’s of London has a policy that sends €1,000 per hectare to Spanish olive farmers as soon as the temperatures reach 36 degrees. So these are very simple solutions to put in place, very easy to implement and also quite cheap in fact, which is the main advantage. Rather than compensate the farmers after their losses are reported insurance companies monitor a specific parameter such as rainfall or temperature. When this passes an agreed threshold they pay out a lump sum. Known as parametric insurance, this approach can help the insurance companies cut costs and in turn bring down premiums for the consumer. But as the climate crisis worsens the same challenges are likely to re-emerge. We cannot expect insurers to save us from climate change because the world fundamentally cannot be insured against climate change. However many companies already offer discounts to homeowners who for example install metallic shutters on the windows or flood-proof doors. But they could make a more drastic step. So a city on the coast wants to build flood defences. This will require a lot of money but perhaps insurers maybe in cooperation with banks could offer some financing for them to do that. They can help us design solutions or take measures that will limit losses. And this is really the crucial role they can play.

But the climate of this unique and remote region can be both an early indicator of the climate of the rest of the Earth and a driver for weather patterns across the globe. William Chapman explains why scientists often describe the Arctic as the “canary in the coal mine” when it comes to climate change. Lesson by William Chapman, animation by Sandro Katamashvili.

Her score lets us hear decades of Arctic sea ice loss in just minutes. In the beautiful and sometimes discordant piano piece, played by Kristina Lee, numerical scientific data becomes an emotional experience intended to reconnect us to the rhythm of the planet. Judy Twedt is a fifth-generation Washingtonian who pursued a PhD in atmospheric sciences at the UW to better understand the physics of global climate change. Three years into her research after the reversal of US participation in the Paris Climate Accord, she designed a new PhD program to develop novel ways to increase comprehension of our changing climate — by listening to the vital signs of the planet. She uses climate data to create climate soundtracks with three-dimensional, spatialized sound fields. These soundtracks explore tensions between the time-scales of human experience and that of climate change. She mixes art and science to promote public reckoning with our changing climate and its associated risks. She has received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; the University of Washington's Husky 100 and Husky Green Awards for her work in sustainability and science communication. She enjoys swimming in the Puget Sound, making pies and addressing big multi-disciplinary problems. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In fact, 97 percent of published reports agree that climate change is fuelled by manmade greenhouse gases. But while there is overwhelming consensus within the scientific community, climate change remains a contentious topic in politics in the United States. In this episode, TechKnow examines the debate over climate change. Lindsay Moran travels to Washington, DC to look at what is at stake in the debate. Politicians fall into two camps: those who believe in human-induced climate change and those who don't. When asked why climate change is so politically charged, John Holden, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, tells us: ""I think the most fundamental reason is this misperception that being in favour of addressing the climate change challenge is to be against jobs and the economy."" Shini Somara heads to Miami, Florida, where there simply isn't time for a debate over whether climate change is a legitimate threat. The state is already facing the immediate effects of rising sea levels. According to climate scientist Ben Kirtman, Florida is the epicentre for climate change impacts. Rising sea levels are already affecting the lives of Miami coastline residents. Some have faced property damage from rising water, while others reflect on the reality of relocation. ""I've been here for my entire lifetime,"" says Dan Kipnis, a Miami resident and environmental activist. ""I know for a fact I'm going to have to leave."" Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine says he cannot afford to be concerned with the politics of climate change. ""As mayor I don't have the liberty or time to debate why climate change is happening. All I have is the opportunity to fix it,"" he says. ""That bay is not Republican, it's not Democrat, it knows no limits."" City officials are moving quickly to keep the city dry by installing pumps and raising buildings and streets. The infrastructure is expensive, and applying for funding from the state or federal level again highlights the political divides surrounding climate change. ""When they are trying to get resources from the state of Florida,"" says climate scientist Ben Kirtman, ""they can't really talk about the climate change part of it."" - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/"	Al Jazeera English,News,climate change,al Jazeera,politics,environment,jazeera,TechKnow,US Politics,youtube,climate change politics,climate,change,politics of climate change,climate change usa,usa climate change,climate change 2016,us climate change,global warming,climate change and politics	25	News & Politics	PT24M8S	1448	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wYJ9ChqFZs/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	11611	131.0	8.0	0	47.0	climate crisis	False	0

""Well, I don't think science knows actually,"" Trump added. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi A California environmental official challenged President Donald Trump to believe and follow the science on climate change after Trump suggested that record-breaking temperatures in the state would cool down on their own. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch,” Trump said after Wade Crowfoot, California’s secretary for natural resources, urged him and others not to “put our head in the sand” and simply ignore the warming climate. Trump’s remark during a roundtable in McLellan Park, California, on the wildfires that have engulfed huge swaths of the state, generated laughs from some of the participants. But Crowfoot responded: “I wish science agreed with you.” Trump, with a smirk, shot back: “OK, well, I don’t think science knows, actually.” The White House declined CNBC’s request for further comment on the president’s remarks. Crowfoot tweeted later Monday: “It actually won’t get cooler Mr. President. #ClimateChangeIsReal.” Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, struck a very different tone on the issue. “With every bout with nature’s fury, caused by our own inaction on climate change, more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, on coastlines and farmlands,” Biden said, according to his prepared remarks. “It is happening everywhere. It is happening now. It affects us all,” Biden said. The president has largely blamed the wildfires, which continue to blaze in parts of California, on poor forest management practices. He said at the roundtable, which also included Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, that he had been told by the leader of a “major country” in Europe, ”‘We have trees that are far more explosive’ – explosive in terms of fire – ‘... than they have in California, and we don’t have any problem.’” Trump in the past has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax.” But Crowfoot stressed in his remarks Monday that boiling temperatures in parts of California are part of a larger trend. “We’ve had temperatures explode this summer. You may have learned that we broke a world record in the Death Valley – 130 degrees [Fahrenheit]. But even in greater L.A., 120-plus degrees. And we’re seeing this warming trend make our summers warmer, but also our winters warmer, as well,” Crowfoot said. “I think one area of mutual agreement and priority is vegetation management, but I think we want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forest, and actually work together with that science, that science is going to be key.” “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot said. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

First, create green jobs. Investing in renewable energy could create millions of family sustaining, union jobs and build the infrastructure we need for marginalized communities to access clean water and air. Second, stop dirty energy. A massive investment in renewable energy jobs isn’t enough to combat the climate crisis. If we are going to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we must tackle the problem at its source: Stop digging up and burning more oil, gas, and coal. Third, kick fossil fuel companies out of our politics. For decades, companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP have been polluting our democracy by pouring billions of dollars into our politics and bankrolling elected officials to enact policies that protect their profits. The oil and gas industry spent over $103 million on the 2016 federal elections alone. Fourth, require the fossil fuel companies that have profited from environmental injustice to compensate the communities they've harmed. As if buying off our democracy wasn’t enough, these corporations have also deliberately misled the public for years on the amount of damage their products have been causing. If these solutions sound drastic to you, it’s because they are. They have to be if we have any hope of keeping our planet habitable. The climate crisis is not a far-off apocalyptic nightmare — it is our present day.

Extreme temperatures across the north and east of the country have caused hundreds of deaths. In the south, the searing hot spell has also led to severe water shortages.

The word ‘retirement’ usually implies sitting back, relaxing and winding down - but Fi's TEDx talk challenges this assumption, exploring instead the wisdom, experience and free time that older generations in particular, can bring to critical problems. Fi says, ""We, the Elders, have a key role to play. Do all that you can in the active years you have left. We owe it to the children to leave them the best legacy we can – a sustaining, diverse and inhabitable planet"". One of the earliest members of campaign group Grandparents for a Safe Earth, Fi has spent the last decade committed to environmental activism. Last year, aged 70, Fi joined Extinction Rebellion on the streets of London. Previously a very law-abiding citizen, she was arrested in Oxford Circus, and continues to lead young and old in environmental actions across the country. In her earlier years Fi studied Modern Languages at Oxford University, worked as a librarian and raised two sons. She has been happily married to her husband Andrew for 50 years. #ExtinctionRebellion Credits: Our talks and films are produced, filmed and edited by a brilliant team of talented volunteers and pro-bono partners: Directed and Produced by Mel Rodrigues, Creative Director TEDxBristol Production Manager: Clare Crossley Filmed and edited by Floating Harbour: Richard da Costa Reuben Gaines Chessie Sharman Raph Watson Tom Young Ben Scrase Dan O'Connell Born in 1948, the eldest of four children, Fi went to St Hilda’s College, Oxford on a full grant to study Modern Languages. Shortly afterwards she married Andrew, the young man she met at a speaking compettiton, that she won. Nearly 50 years later they are still together and during that time Fi has worked as a librarian, raised two sons and given her time to a wide variety of voluntary work, including running a Christian retreat house. Fi’s environmental ‘lightbulb moment’ came while living in France in the early 2000s. It was during this time, when she was engaged in a period of deep spiritual reflection, walking the hills and studying the writing of Marion Woodman and Joanna Macy, that she heard the trees screaming during the heatwave of 2003. Her mounting fear for the natural world and desire to speak out brought her back to Bristol, where she immediately threw herself into environmental activism. A dedicated member of ‘Grandparents for a Safe Earth’, over the last decade she has dressed up as a polar bear, a spider monkey and an orangutan, signed hundreds of petitions, lobbied her MP and occupied the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for six hours in June 2018.

More than a thousand people have lost their lives so far and tens of thousands have been rendered homeless due to continuous heavy rainfalls and rising flood levels. Floods have affected 11 states in India, including in areas which have never experienced it before. What really are the causes for the increased incidents of flooding in India? Are these seasonal phenomena becoming worse as the years go by? Can India mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and flooding without jeopardising its economic growth objectives and pull millions out of poverty? And how long can the poor bear the brunt of the devastation caused by the extreme weather events?

During the last 200 years, human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels have increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by 40%. If unchecked, continuing emissions will warm up the planet by 2.6°C to 4.8°C by the end of this century. This would have serious implications for human societies and the natural world.

Hal Harvey, an energy and climate expert, explains how net-zero buildings and improved building codes are key to lowering emissions. Buildings consume about 40 percent of all energy, and too much of that energy is wasted. Architects and builders can lower energy needs with better insulation, better windows, more thermal mass and overhangs.

On a simple level, music festivals have significant carbon footprints, and efforts to mitigate them are necessary. More intriguingly, though, festivals are an apt testing ground for new ideas in sustainability. Whether it's Houghton's reusable cup scheme, the ""circular waste economies"" at We Love Green and DGTL, or the many other initiatives at events like Gottwood, Terraforma and Meadows In The Mountains, more and more festivals are trialling bold new methods of sustainability, in some cases winning awards for them. It's an encouraging sign of how dance music can play a positive role in the world's response to the climate crisis. In this 10 minute film, we look at a small selection of electronic music festivals rising to this challenge, and examine the ways they're pushing sustainability practices forward. This feature is the start of an ongoing series dedicated to electronic music and the climate crisis. You can also read our feature about what can dance music do about the climate crisis (https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3476) and listen to an audio feature on the sustainability of vinyl (https://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?exchange=465).

Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office Hadley Centre said we are ""seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3C"". While natural weather patterns have driven recent fires, researchers said it's ""common sense"" that human-induced heating is playing a role. Last year was Australia's warmest and driest year on record.

As families flee water scarcity, crop failure and rising sea levels, the refugee crisis is bound to wreak havoc on the international system with tremendous economic and political consequences. Russia, however, is likely to be insulated from the most disastrous effects. In fact, the Russians actually stand to benefit from climate change in numerous ways, and policymakers in Moscow believe this is their license to global resurgence.

Not by rehashing the same data and facts we've been discussing for years, says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. In this inspiring, pragmatic talk, Hayhoe shows how the key to having a real discussion is to connect over shared values like family, community and religion -- and to prompt people to realize that they already care about a changing climate. ""We can't give in to despair,"" she says. ""We have to go out and look for the hope we need to inspire us to act -- and that hope begins with a conversation, today.""

In a trio of directives, Mr. Biden directed the Interior secretary to freeze new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters ""wherever possible,"" and review existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on federal lands and water. The president's executive order sets a goal of conserving at least 30% of land and water by 2030, and begins the process for the U.S. to develop an emission reduction target and a climate finance plan.

Dan Miller shares his passion and empathy for saving our planet. While focusing on a simple solution to help fix climate change, he alerts us on our responsibilities as engaged citizens to be involved and take urgent actions towards the environment, our planet, and our society. Credit: all media and images are creative common or belong to the speaker. Dan Miller is Managing Director of The Roda Group, a Berkeley venture capital group he co-founded that is focused on cleantech. Dan is a member of the board of carbon capture company Inventys Thermal Technologies and battery developer Gridtential, and was previously the president of Ask Jeeves, Inc. Dan co-founded TCSI Corporation, which became a leading provider of telecommunications software. Before that, he designed communication satellite payloads at Hughes Aircraft (now Boeing) Space & Communications. He received his BS degree from Cornell and his MS from Stanford. Dan is a leading advocate on the need to take urgent action to address climate change About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)	ted x,United States,English,Energy,ted,Public Policy,Culture,ted talks,Data Science,tedx,TEDxTalks,tedx talks,tedx talk,ted talk,History,Global Issues,Climate Change	29	Nonprofits & Activism	PT16M32S	992	2d	hd	True	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0k2-SzlDGko/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	421304	5734.0	1026.0	0	2374.0	climate crisis	True	0

With the climate crisis gaining recognition around the world and climate strikes in full swing with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in a plea for action against climate change, I figured it would be good to look at what might be the best solution to climate change: trees. Trees capture and store carbon, reducing the amount of CO2 in the air. Recently a study looked at the amount of trees we could plant on Earth, which lead to a lot of people thinking we could solve the climate change issue by planting a trillion trees. But this isn't exactly true. Find out why in my latest video!

Help NCSE build their climate change in scripted media database: https://ncse.ngo/understanding-climate-change-scripted-media-project In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, we look at how and why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. We look at the last 30 years of television comedies that address climate change from The Simpsons to South Park to The Good Place to Modern Family to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to understand why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. TV comedies use a number of character archetypes that turn environmentalists into obnoxious pariahs, directly deny the existence of climate change in the case of South Park, or build jokes and comedic elements on how hopeless climate action can be. TV comedies ultimately have undermined needed progress on climate change and climate action by approaching the issue of climate change in an unproductive way. To conclude we offer a number of avenues through which TV comedies like The Simpsons, The Politician, and The Good Place might be able to actually spur climate action through jokes and comedy. Big thanks to Kate Carter and the NCSE graduate student outreach fellows! They researched and wrote the script for this video.

But an issue that may have received less attention is just how long this process lasts. Even if humans stopped emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere tomorrow, the expansion effect would continue in the oceans for centuries more, making it effectively irreversible in our lifetimes.” How Eating Seaweed Can Help Cows to Belch Less Methane https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-eating-seaweed-can-help-cows-to-belch-less-methane “Emissions from the world’s nearly 1.5 billion cattle are a major source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.

Over the coming century, it is expected to affect agriculture, energy, health, infrastructure, natural resources, national security and water availability. This assessment, which represents the most up to date and comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on the U.S., provides critical input to planning and policy at the state and national level to reduce the human influence on climate and adapt to future change. Katharine Hayhoe, Ph.D., is director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech, part of the South-Central Climate Science Center. Her research focuses on developing and applying high-resolution climate projections to evaluate the future impacts of climate change on human society and the natural environment. Hayhoe has published more than 70 peer-reviewed publications and served as lead author on key reports for the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National Academy of Sciences. Hayhoe is currently serving as lead author for the 2014 Third U.S. National Climate Assessment. Hayhoe earned a bachelor’s of science in physics and astronomy from the University of Toronto and an M.S. and Ph.D. in atmospheric science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Some scientists believe genetically modified trees could be a possible fix. Some say altering a tree’s DNA would allow the tree to grow twice as fast, absorb twice as much carbon in half the time, and sequester even more carbon from the atmosphere to slow down the climate crisis.

Here’s why regenerative agriculture might be the key to securing a safe and healthy future. » Subscribe to NowThis Earth: https://go.nowth.is/Future_Subscribe » Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThis Some experts claim regenerative agriculture can reverse climate change by sequestering atmospheric CO2 in soil. Regenerative organic farming emphasizes the importance of soil health and includes practices like cover cropping, crop rotation, holistic animal grazing, and the use of compost. Proponents suggest it could increase biodiversity, make farms more resilient to floods, produce healthier food, and improve farm animal welfare. 'Healthy soil equals healthy food equals healthy people,' says Jeff Moyer, the CEO of the Rodale Institute, which has studied regenerative and organic farming methods for 70 years. 'The age of chemical food production is gone. Regenerative organic agriculture is really the future.' #Agriculture #Climate #Soil #Earth #Environment #Science #NowThis Connect with NowThis » Subscribe to NowThis News: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe » Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook » Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter » Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram » Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_Snapchat NowThis Earth is daily news coverage of climate, sustainability, biodiversity, species extinction, and environmental justice, and other planetary concerns.

Billed the “affair of the century”, the legal case was brought by four NGOs who accused the French state of not living up to its own commitments - including a multi-year plan to cut carbon emissions - or to the 2015 Paris Climate accord. This was the first time a French court has ruled that the state can be held responsible for its climate commitments ramping up pressure on other countries to act on global warming as well. The court ordered the state to pay each of the four organizations a symbolic amount of one euro in compensation. #France #Climate #Court 📣 Arirang News(Facebook) : https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews 📣 Arirang News(Twitter) : https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews 📣 News Center(YouTube) : https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV 2021-02-04, 07:00 (KST)	arirang,korean,South Korea,Arirang News,news,Seoul,arirang tv,아리랑tv,아리랑뉴스,뉴스,북한,north korea,대한민국,미국,U.S.,policy,politics,정치,정책,경제,economy,스포츠,날씨,weather,이슈,월드,world,global,issue,sports,프랑스,법원,정부,기후,변화,환경,책임,배상,글로벌,court,France,climate,change,government,guilty,environment,carbon,emission,compensation	25	News & Politics	PT37S	37	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9j9jw8N2Jw/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	153	9.0	1.0	0	3.0	climate crisis	False	0

We never played it live before, as it is a challenging one to play, and place in a set list. It’s emotionally heavy, and would almost “hurt” the rest of the songs in a way. We just really wanted to do this on camera for our fans. Global warming is a reality and a relevant topic, we feel it’s good to be reminded of one of the most important challenges of our time: How to grow as a species without being a parasite to our planet, the only home we have. “We will see our children growing” is a mantra for future generations, and in a figurative way we hope the children in all of us will grow, evolve, and take action for a more compassionate and meaningful world.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos All of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn’t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels. The US isn’t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can’t get there without the US’s full participation. But the current US president doesn’t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does. Biden’s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn’t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years. This was the first in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

Sources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesgeoengineering By the end of the 21st century, humanity is becoming desperate. Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan... It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse. What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?

The island off the coast of Venezuela is feeling the impact of climate change and pollution. Julieta is moved to take action. The teenager is fearless when it comes to saving animals. Turtles are an endangered species. Warming oceans are fueling algae growth, as are fertilizers flushed into the sea from Brazil. The turtles come up for air, and get entangled in the bloom. Julieta and her fellow activists from an island conservancy group are committed to saving as many turtles as they can. Their efforts are backed by veterinarian Odette Doest and her emissary for conservancy, Bob the flamingo. ------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This promising new route provides a welcome opportunity to bypass the far longer southern route that connects Korea, Japan, and China with the West, through pirate-infested waters. The southern route, which carries 90% of petroleum, fishery products, and other trade, is a vital lifeline for Asia, but a northern route through the Bering Sea and across the North Pole is 40% shorter and could be a boon for trade. The Russians are leading the race for a safe summer route that travels through their newly booming ports, but other countries, including Japan, Canada, Germany, and Korea, are catching up. As the ice melts each summer, these countries are stepping up to find a profitable way to take advantage of an unexpected benefit of global climate change. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Subscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ Join the club and become a Free Documentary Patron: https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary Facebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG Twitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ #FreeDocumentary #Documentary #IceRace ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Free Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.

CONTENT: Temperature Will Rise: Climate models predict that Earth’s global average temperate will rise in the future. For the next two decades warming of about 0.2° Celsius is projected. If we continue to emit as many, or more, greenhouse gases, this will cause more warming during the 21st Century than we saw in the 20th Century. During the 21st Century, various computer models predict that Earth’s average temperature will rise between 1.8° and 4.0° Celsius (3.2° and 7.2° F). The amount of predicted warming differs depending on the model emissions scenario (how much greenhouse gas emissions it assumes for the future). The amount of predicted warming also differs between different climate models. Climate change is predicted to impact regions differently. For example, temperature increases are expected to be greater on land than over oceans and greater at high latitudes than in the tropics and mid-latitudes. Changing Precipitation: Warmer average global temperature will cause a higher rate of evaporation, causing the water cycle to “speed up”. More water vapor in the atmosphere will lead to more precipitation. According to models, global average precipitation will most likely increase by about 3-5% with a minimum increase of at least 1% and a maximum increase of about 8%. Yet, changes in precipitation will not be evenly distributed. Some locations will get more snow, others will see less rain. Some places will have wetter winters and drier summers. Melting Snow and Ice: As the climate warms, snow and ice melt. The amount of summer melting of glaciers, ice sheets, and other snow and ice on land are predicted to be greater than the amount of winter precipitation. The amount of sea ice (frozen seawater) floating in the ocean in the Arctic and Antarctic is expected to decrease over the 21st Century too, although there is some uncertainty as to the amount of melt. Rising Sea Level: A warmer climate causes sea level to rise via two mechanisms: (1) melting glaciers and ice sheets (ice on land) add water to the oceans, raising sea level, and (2) ocean water expands as it warms, increasing its volume and thus also raising sea level. During the 20th Century, sea level rose about 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches). Thermal expansion and melting ice each contributed about half of the rise, though there is some uncertainty in the exact magnitude of the contribution from each source. By the year 2100, models predict sea level will rise between about 20 and 50 cm (8 to 20 inches) above late 20th Century levels. Thermal expansion of sea water is predicted to account for about 75% of future sea level rise according to most models. Acidic Ocean Water: Earth's oceans are predicted to act as a buffer against climate change by taking up some of the excess heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is good news in the short run, but more problematic in the long run. Carbon dioxide combined with seawater forms weak carbonic acid. Scientists believe this process has reduced the pH of the oceans by about 0.1 pH since pre-industrial times. Further acidification of 0.14 to 0.35 pH is expected by the year 2100. More acidic ocean water may cause problems for marine organisms. Impacts on Ocean Currents: Large-scale ocean currents called thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in salinity and temperature, may also be disrupted as climate warms. Changes in precipitation patterns and the influx of fresh water into the oceans from melting ice can alter salinity. Changing salinity, along with rising water temperature, may disrupt the currents. In an extreme case, thermohaline circulation could be disrupted or even shut down in some parts of the ocean, which could have large effects on climate.

Sea levels have been rising at a greater rate year after year, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates they could rise by another meter or more by the end of this century. As National Geographic showed us in 2013, sea levels would rise by 216 feet if all the land ice on the planet were to melt. This would dramatically reshape the continents and drown many of the world's major cities.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg makes his debate debut, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders takes the lead in the polls. Just three days before the crucial Nevada caucuses, Democratic candidates took the stage in a contentious debate, firing off rounds of attacks on newcomer Mike Bloomberg. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Bloomberg spent two hours Wednesday night duking it out at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. It was the ninth overall debate – and the most pugnacious. But it was the first that featured Bloomberg, who doesn’t take campaign contributions and did not qualify for previous ones because he didn’t meet donor thresholds. The debate opened with Warren and Sanders, who have built their campaigns around the promise to reduce wealth inequality, throwing jabs at Bloomberg, who has spent about $400 million of his personal fortune on campaign ads. since joining the race in late November. Despite his presence at the Nevada debate, Bloomberg is not on a ballot until Super Tuesday March 3. Sanders maintains a lead in national polls and held a 19-point edge in Nevada, according to a survey released Monday. The Nevada caucuses could present an opportunity for Biden, who maintained the lead for months, to bounce back against Sanders. However, Biden, the former front-runner, came across as mostly an afterthought in Wednesday’s debate. He is at risk of underperforming in Nevada on Saturday and the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29, after he flopped in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Trump has blamed poor forest management for the deadly fires, though many of the blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands, not forest. When addressing reporters after exiting Air Force One, Trump was asked if climate change was also part of the problem, in combination with forest management. Trump said he thinks, ""a lot of things are possible."" But he says when it comes to forests, downed trees and dried leaves on the ground eventually ""just explode."" The president said countries in Europe don't have the same issues with wildfires because they manage their forests. ""So we have to do that in California,"" he said. Inside, during a meeting with officials on the fires, California Gov. Gavin Newsom accepted that his state can do a better job of forest management. But he told Trump that it is ""self-evident that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this."" Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, argued that ""if we ignore that science and sort of put our heads in the sand and think it's all about vegetation management, we're not going to succeed together in protecting California."" Trump replied: ""It'll start getting cooler. You just watch."" Crowfoot said, ""I wish science agreed with you."" Trump got in the last word of the exchange: ""Well, I don't think science knows actually.""

By generating a holistic understanding of Earth’s ecosystems, we transform our ability to understand climate change, and identify the best strategies to address it. With this in mind, Crowther and his team of 25 researchers are looking at ways to digitally explore the biosphere and reveal the true potential of nature-based solutions in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. Advances in data collection and artificial intelligence are revealing more truths about our environment and the seriousness of climate change. At the same time, it’s also helping to find new solutions that harness the power of nature itself. The Crowther Lab research is helping organizations understand the true value of nature, make more informed decisions, and start implementing nature-based solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss. Get ready to discover a new approach to Climate Change. Thomas Crowther, professor of Global Ecosystem Ecology at ETH Zurich and founder of the Crowther Lab is different to most environmental scientists. While most labs in the world focus on one field of research, Crowther firmly believes that to understand the ecological processes that influence climate change, predict its progression with high accuracy, and develop nature-based solutions to address it, we need to take a holistic approach. Specialising in ecosystem ecology, Crowther is also the chief scientific advisor to the UN’s Trillion Tree Campaign. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The Amazon Rainforest is big news right now as fires continue to consume its lush landscape. It’s essential to our planet’s climate, ecosystem, and more. If we do nothing, the Amazon could be gone within 100 years. What would that mean for us? Well, did you know that a lot of the ingredients in our modern medicines come from the plants of the Amazon? These include the most important medications, such as essential vaccines. Millions of people depend on the Amazon basin for their income. So it would certainly be devastating for South American people. Also, if the fires continue, not only will we lose the huge oxygen source, but extra pollution will be released. And that is not all!

If it was suddenly gone, a lot of South America’s exports and businesses would disappear with it. - Our planet gets 20% of its oxygen from this Rainforest, due to its massive size. - Covering just over 2 million square miles, the Amazon is home to 30% of our planet’s wildlife. - If the Amazon were destroyed, you can kiss your morning joe goodbye, in addition to fruits, rice, and CHOCOLATE, just to name a few. - In addition to oxygen and medicinal plants, we’d also lose a substantial supplier of minerals, fresh water, and food. - Science has shown that rainforests, in general, influence the climate both globally and locally. - Unhealthy soil would add to the disaster: excessive rain + unanchored soil = mudslide. Farmland and homes would be overcome with rain and mud. - Rural people will be forced into the cities, which are already home to millions. This will cause overcrowding, which comes with its own problems.

Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Today, president Jair Bolsonaro, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage.

So in terms of climate change, the African rainforest/ Congo Basin is twice as important as its surface area. There is a clear link between the rainforest of Eastern Dem. Republic of Congo and the rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands. So if we cut down the forests of DRC, not only will we put more CO2 in to the atmosphere, but Ethiopia will also loose its rainfall. It's likely that the same relationship will apply to Gabon and Congo, and the Sahel. In all the rainforest models they predict that in the next 20 - 30 years, Sahel will loose half of its rain fall, because of climate change. So we a responsibility in the Congo Basin, the DRC, The Congo and Gabon, because we know that the people in Sahel will die if we cut down the rainforest.

Come explore the vast interactive network of plants, animal, and insects in tropical rainforests. Fueled by sunlight and rain, rainforests are some of the most diverse energy-rich ecosystems on the planet. In addition to showcasing live footage from a unique ecosystem, each of the three videos in the Exploring Ecosystems series features an opportunity for students to actively participate in a problem-solving scenario based on an ongoing research project of an Academy scientist like Michelle Trautwein. As you watch the video, be prepared to pause at key points to participate fully! Explore arthropods, insects like Leafcutter ants (Atta colombica or Atta cephalotes) or katydids (Tettigoniidae), and amphibians like the Poison Dart Frog (Dendrobatidae). The Tropical Rainforest Diversity video investigates the following questions: How does the biodiversity within an ecosystem influence the stability of that ecosystem? How can we make rainforests more resilient to change and human-induced disruptions like deforestation and climate change? What are the four main layers of the rainforest, and how are the conditions within each allowing certain species to thrive? Check for Understanding Which of the three hypothetical rainforest communities was most diverse, and why is that important? Connect your answer to the ideas of species richness and species abundance, being sure to differentiate the two. Key Scientific Terms abiotic: non-living biodiversity: the variety of life on Earth or some other specified geographic region of the planet; the diversity of life occurs at the genetic level, at the species level, at the ecosystem level, and in evolutionary lineages ecosystem: the community of different species in a particular geographic area and all of their interactions with each other and the physical environment; ecosystems are also called ecological networks photosynthesis: the process of capturing the energy in sunlight to create energy-rich organic molecules from inorganic molecules; organisms that photosynthesize are called photosynthesizers species: a distinct type of organism species richness: the number of different species in a given geographic area Connections to High School Standards AP Biology (1) Justify the selection of mathematical routines to solve problems. (2) Apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural phenomena. Essential knowledge 4.C.4: The diversity of species within an ecosystem may influence the stability of the ecosystem.

This success has been achieved despite high beef and soy prices, which in previous years had pushed deforestation upward, and during a time that Brazil had rapid economic growth and made important progress in reducing poverty, hunger, and inequality. Brazil’s reduction in emissions from deforestation is the largest contribution so far by any country—rich or poor—to reducing global warming pollution.” Deforestation: Facts, Causes & Effects http://www.livescience.com/27692-deforestation.html “Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests in order to make the land available for other uses. An estimated 18 million acres (7.3 million hectares) of forest, which is roughly the size of the country of Panama, are lost each year, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).” Tropical Deforestation Affects Rainfall in the U.S. and Around the Globe https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2005/deforest_rainfall.html “Today, scientists estimate that between one-third and one-half of our planet's land surfaces have been transformed by human development. Now, a new study is offering insight into the long-term impacts of these changes, particularly the effects of large-scale deforestation in tropical regions on the global climate.” ____________________ Seeker inspires us to see the world through the lens of science and evokes a sense of curiosity, optimism and adventure.

By the end of the century, 75% of the world's population will experience extreme heat and if current trends continue, whole regions of Asia will be rendered uninhabitable by direct heat. But for many, deadly heat is already part of their daily lives. In this episode, we meet those who are most vulnerable to heat - schoolchildren in Sumba, the elderly in Singapore and slum-dwellers in Delhi - and learn how heat is a silent killer.

The Amazon could turn into a source of carbon in the atmosphere, instead of one of the biggest absorbers of the gas, as soon as the next decade, owing to the damage caused by loggers and farming interests and the impacts of the climate crisis, new research has found. If that happens, climate breakdown is likely to become much more severe in its impacts, and the world will have to cut down much faster on carbon-producing activities to counteract the loss of the carbon sinks. “We’ve found that one of the most worrying impacts of climate change has already begun,” said Simon Lewis, professor in the school of geography at Leeds University, one of the senior authors of the research. “This is decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.”"" #TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks"	200305__DR07meanwhileInTheAmazon,News,Politics,amazon rainforest carbon,amazon rainforest benefits,amazon rainforest climate change,amazon rainforest,amazon rainforest climate,amazon rainforest weather,amazon rainforest deforestation,amazon rainforest feedback,amazon forest,carbon dioxide,carbon dioxide cycle,co2 emissions,co2 levels,co2,rainforest,amazon,climate crisis,climate change,environmentalism,sustainability,greta thunberg,green new deal,bernie sanders	25	News & Politics	PT3M50S	230	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRF245N-qPs/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	17705	1332.0	15.0	0	236.0	climate change rainforest	False	0

This video explains the basics of the Paris Agreement: the international UN treaty of 2015 that aims to tackle climate change head on. It's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with ambition to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.

While Obama said the deal will help delay some of the most pressing threats posed by climate change, it alone ""will not solve the climate crisis.” Seventy-two countries have formally signed the agreement, including China, India and the U.S, some of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

That's the view of Bjorn Lomborg, who's been named one of the most influential people of the 21st century. Lomborg, who has his own think tank and has written several books on the issue, admits that climate change is real, but says the Paris accord is a tiny way of doing something about global warming. He argues that it will solve just one percent of the problem at a very high cost. Lomborg argues that what we should be doing instead is investing the money into research and development of green energy, which needs to be made cheaper than fossil fuels.

This video explains the basics of the Paris Agreement: the international UN treaty of 2015 that aims to tackle climate change head on. It's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with ambition to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. Produced by: @UN Climate Change -------- The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.

French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, speaking for many, called it a ""historic turning point."" The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, echoed the minister's remark when she testified before the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. The Paris Agreement was, she said, an ""incredible achievement."" But when pressed by committee members to explain exactly how much this treaty would reduce global temperatures, she would not – or could not – say. This combination of grand pronouncements and vague specifics is a good strategy for Paris Agreement fans to take. Because the agreement will cost a fortune, but do little to reduce global warming. Consider the Obama administration's signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan. Using the same climate prediction model that the UN uses, I found that the power plan will accomplish almost nothing. Even if its cuts to carbon dioxide emissions are fully implemented – not just for the 14 years that the Paris Agreement lasts, but for the rest of the century – the Clean Power Plan would reduce the temperature increase in 2100 by just 0.023 degrees Fahrenheit. The President has made further, and grander, promises of future U.S. carbon cuts, but these are only vaguely outlined. In the unlikely event that all of these extra cuts also happen, and are adhered to throughout the rest of the century, the combined reduction in temperatures would be 0.057 degrees. To put it another way, if the U.S. delivers for the whole century on the President's very ambitious rhetoric, it would postpone global warming by about eight months at the end of the century. Now let's add in the rest of the world's Paris promises. If we generously assume that the promised carbon cuts for 2030 are not only met (which itself would be a U.N. first), but sustained, throughout the rest of the century, temperatures in 2100 would drop by 0.3 degrees – the equivalent of postponing warming by less than four years. Again, that's using the UN's own climate prediction model. But here's the biggest problem: These miniscule benefits do not come free; quite the contrary. The cost of the Paris climate pact is likely to run to 1 to 2 trillion dollars every year, based on estimates produced by the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum and the Asia Modeling Exercise. In other words, we will spend at least one hundred trillion dollars in order to reduce the temperature, by the end of the century, by a grand total of three tenths of one degree. Some Paris Agreement supporters defend it by claiming that its real impact on temperatures will be much more significant than the U.N. model predicts. But this requires mental gymnastics and heroic assumptions.

Script: The Paris climate deal has a lot of people cheering, with world leaders like President Obama painting it as a historic moment…[show short clip from his speech], but what exactly does this agreement do and what does it mean for the world? The major achievement is that for the first time ever virtually all nations committed to reducing their carbon emissions “as soon as possible” and to do their best to keep global warming “to well below two degrees celsius.” If the world can keep temperature rise below two degrees we’ll have a good shot at avoiding the worst. And seeing as though the 1 degree celsius warming that has already occurred has caused us to begin suffering from noticeably more severe weather, this agreement is long overdue. The problem is that it’s not legally binding: it doesn’t create rigid timelines for countries to meet their pledges, pledges that vary wildly from country to country--especially for the BRIC nations that are still developing and are understandably wary of sacrificing their own economic growth for the greater planetary good. That’s why pledges initially made in this deal aren’t anywhere near enough to meet the 2 degree goal. But getting every country to commit to at least some kind of carbon reduction represents huge progress. Wealthier nations, basically the US and Europe, will also contribute significant amounts of money toward helping poorer countries develop clean power systems and reduce deforestation, which is the second largest contributor to climate change after the burning of fossil fuels. The agreement also establishes a transparent method for measuring and assessing how well each country is meeting its targets. And Nations have committed to coming back every five years with new targets that should get increasingly more ambitious as the pace of technological development continues to advance. So even though the Paris agreement didn’t do nearly enough to make sure the problem will be solved once and for all, the bottom line is that, by acting with one unified voice, the governments of the world finally sent a clear message: that the days of burning fossil fuels will quickly be coming to an end. This is what President Obama alluded to when he said: “this agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future. And that has the potential to unleash investment and innovation in clean energy at a scale we have never seen before.” Companies like Shell, Exxon and BP, and countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf neighbors are going to have to rapidly shift their revenue models toward clean energy, or risk being left behind. Although America was a leader in achieving this result, our work is just beginning. We’ve got to continue to defeat the fossil fuel industry’s attempts to undercut efforts to fight climate change here at home. And the most obvious battle will take place on November 8, 2016, when we can elect a congress and a President who will take the torch from President Obama and continue the clean energy transformation of the world’s largest economy. So that’s what the Paris Climate Agreement is all about--it’s up to us to decide whether it will indeed represent a moment of incredible progress for mankind. Thanks for watching.

The deal isn’t worth the paper it is written on. -------- Don't miss a single video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://johnstossel.activehosted.com/f/1 --------- But many politicians and much of the media are horrified. Al Gore called pulling out of the Paris Agreement a “reckless and indefensible decision.” Former President Obama said: “This administration joins a handful of nations that reject the future."" Really? Have they read the agreement? Stossel interviewed one of the few people who did, City Journal Contributing Writer Oren Cass. He describes the agreement as “somewhere between a farce and a fraud.” Why so dismissive? Because, as Cass told Stossel, “you don't even have to mention greenhouse gases in your commitment. You send in any piece of paper you want, we're going to staple them all together and we're going to call that the Paris Accord.” What is in these commitments (or not in them) will surprise you. China pledged to “achieve the peaking of carbon dioxide emissions around 2030.” That sounds good, except a U.S. government study, done before the Paris Agreement, estimated China would reach peak emissions by 2030. So China pledged to continue doing exactly what it was doing. Yet Cass told Stossel China was one of the better pledges. “India made no pledge to limit their emissions at all. They pledged only to become more efficient…But they proposed to become efficient less quickly than they're already becoming more efficient. So their pledge was to slow down.” Pakistan’s pledge was even more meaningless, simply pledge to reak a peak emission “much beyond the year 2030."" Cass says only one country took a different approach, the U.S., which set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels, by 2025. “President Obama took all the zero commitments from everybody else, but threw in a really expensive one for us.” Oren Cass and John Stossel don’t dispute basic climate science. Stossel says yes, the earth is warming. Man may well be increasing that. But the solution isn’t to waste billions by forcing emissions cuts in America while other countries do nothing-- while pretending to make cuts. Trump was right to repudiate this phony treaty. Most of us didn’t even know how phony it was. But now we do."

And yet, it was deemed weak because it was all voluntary. Bloomberg's Akshat Rathi explains why the agreement's weakness is also its strength.

Check out Rand Paul's website here▼ http://www.paul.senate.gov/ Like Rand Paul on Facebook▼ http://www.facebook.com/RandPaul Follow Rand Paul on Twitter▼ http://twitter.com/RandPaul Follow Rand Paul on Instagram▼ http://instagram.com/drrandpaul/ A Short Bio on Rand Paul Senator Rand Paul, M.D. is one of the nation’s leading advocates for liberty. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, Dr. Paul has proven to be an outspoken champion for constitutional liberties and fiscal responsibility. As a fierce advocate against government overreach, Rand has fought tirelessly to return government to its limited, constitutional scope. A devoted husband and father, Dr. Paul and his family live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Rand owned his own ophthalmology practice and performed eye surgery for 18 years. As a hard-working and dedicated physician--not a career politician--Rand Paul came to Washington to shake things up and to make a difference. Dr. Paul has been married for 24 years to Kelley Ashby Paul of Russellville, Kentucky, and together, they have three sons: William, 21; Duncan, 18; and Robert, 15. He regularly volunteered to coach teams for each of his three sons in Little League baseball, soccer, and basketball. Rand and Kelley are both devout Christians and are active in their local church. Rand is the third of five children born to Carol and Ron Paul. He grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas and attended Baylor University. He graduated from Duke Medical School in 1988. Dr. Paul completed a general surgery internship at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta and completed his residency in ophthalmology at Duke University Medical Center. Upon completion of his training in 1993, Rand and Kelley moved to Bowling Green to start their family and begin his ophthalmology practice. In 1995, Rand founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic, an organization that provides eye exams and surgery to needy families and individuals. Rand is a former president and 17-year member of Lions Clubs International, which is dedicated to preserving sight by providing eyeglasses and surgery to the less fortunate around the world. In recognition of his outstanding and sustained efforts to provide vision care to Kentuckians in need, Lions Clubs International has awarded Rand many of its highest commendations. A large part of Rand's daily work as an ophthalmologist was dedicated to preserving the vision of our seniors. In 2002, The Twilight Wish Foundation recognized Rand for Outstanding Service and Commitment to Seniors. During his free time, Dr. Paul performs pro-bono eye surgeries for patients across Kentucky. Additionally, he provides free eye surgery to children from around the world through his participation in the Children of the Americas Program. Most recently, he traveled to Guatemala on a medical mission trip with the University of Utah's Moran Eye Center. During the week over 200 patients, many of them blind with cataracts had their vision restored by Dr. Paul. Dr. Paul's entrance into politics is indicative of his life’s work as a surgeon: a desire to diagnose problems and provide practical solutions, whether it be in Bowling Green, Kentucky or Washington, D.C. Randal Howard ""Rand"" Paul (born January 7, 1963) is an American physician and politician from Kentucky. In office since 2011, Paul currently serves in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party. He is also a trained ophthalmologist and is the middle son of former U.S. Representative and physician Ron Paul of Texas. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paul attended Baylor University and is a graduate of the Duke University School of Medicine. Paul began practicing ophthalmology in 1993 in Bowling Green, Kentucky and established his own clinic in December 2007. Paul has been considered a supporter of the Tea Party movement, and a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve System. He has opposed NSA mass surveillance of Americans and supports reduced government spending and taxation. He describes himself as ""100% pro-life"" and has cosponsored legislation for the equal protection of the right to life from conception. Paul officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 U.S. presidential election on April 7, 2015."	rand paul,rand,paul,Senator Rand Paul,ron paul,Hillary Clinton,Donald Trump,Rand Paul 2016,trump 2016,tea party conservative,kentucky senator,libertarian politician,libertarian senator,bernie sanders,barack obama,make america great again,republican senator,republican congressman,republican politician,justin amash,conservative,ron pauls son,best senator,paris agreement,climate change	25	News & Politics	PT5M6S	306	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jF5JRXSUBsc/maxresdefault.jpg		47636	587.0	69.0	0	121.0	paris agreement	True	0

This week we take a look at what's in store. Climate Activism Websites and General Research Websites below...

The 16-year-old activist said: 'If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like we do today ... if our house was falling apart you wouldn’t hold three emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and the environment.'

She said the science has been clear for 30 years, and still they are not doing enough. The 16-year-old warned the more than 60 presidents and prime ministers gathered in the General Assembly hall for the summit that the youth would not let them “get away with this.” She said they draw the line here and now and “change is coming,” whether they like it or not. ––––––––– LINK: https://www.voanews.com/usa/teen-climate-activist-thunberg-scolds-leaders-inaction	Greta,Thunberg,Climate,Change,Summit,United,Nations,Speech,Autism,Activism,Activist,Global,Warming	25	News & Politics	PT1M33S	93	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Gq5Gk_qZqg/maxresdefault.jpg		160138	1096.0	3199.0	0	1509.0	climate change greta	True	0

Thunberg, Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Belgians Anuna de Wever van der Heyden and Adélaïde Charlier arrived at the chancellery for a 90-minute meeting Thursday, the first high-profile talks the youth activists have held with a world leader since the start of the pandemic. The coronavirus outbreak has prevented the Fridays for Future movement that Thunberg inspired from holding its mass rallies in recent months. The activists argue that governments around the world are doing too little to curb emissions of greenhouse gases that are heating up the atmosphere. In a letter sent to world leaders last month, they called for numerous measures including ending financing for oil and gas projects, including all forms of man-made emissions in reduction targets and setting binding carbon budgets. Germany currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union. Merkel has in the past lauded the youth activists for putting pressure on politicians to act against global warming.

The event near the Colorado state Capitol will include a panel of youth activists and end with a “die-in” that organizers say will symbolize those people facing danger and death because of climate change. Thunberg has staged weekly “Fridays for Future” demonstrations for a year to call for faster action against climate change. She has inspired students around the world to skip classes on Fridays to demonstrate as well. The 16-year-old sailed to the U.S. in August to promote her climate change campaign. She garnered international attention when she scolded world leaders at the United Nations. She’s touring the Americas for several months, concluding with a U.N. climate conference in Chile in December.

Ms Thunberg recently attended a meeting with the European Commission as it moves to adopt a continent-wide climate law. The law would commit the EU to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. However, the environmental activist denounced the targets and accused the European Union of “pretending” to tackle climate change. ""Surely the polish is beginning to wear off?"" Ms Tognini told Sky News host Andrew Bolt ""There's nothing wrong with educated young people having a voice in debate, in fact we should be encouraging educated young people to be engaged"". However, ""Greta Thunberg is reading from the same prepared script, there's no facts, it's all emotion, it's all empty words"". Ms Tognini said promoting environmental activist Greta Thunberg ""at every opportunity"" to discuss climate change and pollution is actually ""a tremendous own goal"" for the cause.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg had two very different messages to give over climate change. Our Park Hee-jun has more. Two of the most high-profile attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos ensured it was impossible to miss the annual meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump and teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg,... carried on their indirect debate on climate change. In his keynote speech on Tuesday, local time,... President Trump revealed that the U.S. will join the initiative to plant one trillion trees. ""Today, I'm pleased to announce the United States will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum. One trillion trees."" While this year's forum is focused on how businesses must change to save the planet,... President Trump's more than 30-minute long speech was devoted to highlighting the importance of the oil and gas industries,... with promises on climate change nowhere to be found. Instead, he warned against listening to the ""prophets of doom."" ""This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism in action. But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse."" Sitting in the audience for the speech was Thunberg. Speaking shortly after President Trump's special address, the Swedish activist took aim at Trump and other world leaders, accusing them of doing nothing and making empty promises on climate change. ""You say children shouldn't worry. You say just leave this to us. We will fix this. We promise we won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic. And then, nothing. Silence. Or something worse than silence. Empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken."" She also criticized the lack of action to reduce carbon emissions when the world is in her words ""on fire"". ""I wonder what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing a climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions, without even trying? Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour."" Their mutual dislike of each other has been in the spotlight since last year. Their last encounter was at the UN last September. Photos and videos of Thunberg glaring at President Trump as he passed by after the climate change summit went viral at the time. It was followed by a tweet by the American leader, saying Thunberg should work on her anger management issues.
