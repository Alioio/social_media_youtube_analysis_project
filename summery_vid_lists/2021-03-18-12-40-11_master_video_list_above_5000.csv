We never played it live before, as it is a challenging one to play, and place in a set list. It’s emotionally heavy, and would almost “hurt” the rest of the songs in a way. We just really wanted to do this on camera for our fans. Global warming is a reality and a relevant topic, we feel it’s good to be reminded of one of the most important challenges of our time: How to grow as a species without being a parasite to our planet, the only home we have. “We will see our children growing” is a mantra for future generations, and in a figurative way we hope the children in all of us will grow, evolve, and take action for a more compassionate and meaningful world. Global Warming, recorded at Silver Cord Studio NY, April 2018 Engineered and mixed by Johann Meyer Filmed by Anne Deguehegny and Bunny Edited by Anne Deguehegny and Mario Duplantier FROM MARS TO SIRIUS - LIMITED EDITION WHITE VINYL IN DOUBLE GATEFOLD SLEEVE PRE ORDER HERE: https://www.shop-listenable.net/en/3_gojira	gojira live,gojira 2018,gojira vinyl,heavy metal,progressive metal	22	People & Blogs	PT7M55S	475	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8DiWzvE52ZY/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	6243215	77600.0	1590.0	0	5005.0	climate crisis	True	0

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our diets account for one-fourth of those emissions. The food we eat emits so many greenhouse emissions because of the land it takes to grow it, but it also has something to do with biology. This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer. This video was based on this chart, created by the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local Sources: For more Vox.com coverage of food emissions: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/20/21144017/local-food-carbon-footprint-climate-environment For more of Our World in Data’s data on the emissions related to food production: https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food A lecture given by Joseph Poore, co-author of the study this chart was based on: https://youtu.be/8miQs3mPGu8 Cow and sheep burping footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDjEqYR6CGE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNrFdrxIToo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgGSqJDzN6o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9yRdVAmAag https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLJqZknei9I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPmweCJgvIM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fHjmPQl8FU Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos All of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn’t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels. The US isn’t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can’t get there without the US’s full participation. But the current US president doesn’t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does. Biden’s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn’t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years. This was the first in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Today, president Jair Bolsonaro, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

According to Chomsky, this massive public relations campaign has succeeded in leading a good portion of the population into doubting the human causes of global warming. Known for his criticism of the media, Chomsky doesn't hold back in this clip, laying blame on mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times, which will run frontpage articles on what meteorologists think about global warming. ""Meteorologists are pretty faces reading scripts telling you whether it's going to rain tomorrow,"" Chomsky says. ""What do they have to say any more than your barber?"" All this is part of the media's pursuit of ""fabled objectivity."" Of particular concern for Chomsky is the atmosphere of anger, fear and hostility that currently reigns in America. The public's hatred of Democrats, Republicans, big business and banks and the public's distrust of scientists all lead to general disregard for the findings of ""pointy-headed elitists."" The 2010 elections could be interpreted as a ""death knell for the species"" because most of the new Republicans in Congress are global warming deniers. ""If this was happening in some small country,"" Chomsky concludes, ""it wouldn't matter much. But when it's happening in the richest, most powerful country in the world, it's a danger to the survival of the species.""

Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. ""Today is climate day at the White House and, which means that today is jobs day at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor,"" Biden said at the outset of his remarks at a signing ceremony. ""We're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water cleaner air and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security."" He continued: ""It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer."" The executive order on oil and natural gas leases directs the interior secretary to launch a ""rigorous review"" of the existing leasing and permitting programs related to fossil fuel development, and to identify steps to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. The halting of new leases fulfills a campaign promise by Biden and will expand an existing 60-day moratorium issued by the President on his first day in office. Biden's climate actions mark a sharp departure from the Trump administration's efforts to maximize fossil fuel production and expand oil and gas drilling on federal lands but climate emissaries for the administration emphasized they hope to build new job opportunities out of the changes. White House climate czar Gina McCarthy described the order as one that ""directs everyone who works for the President to use every tool available at our disposal to solve the climate crisis. Because we're going to take a whole of government approach."" #CNN #News #ClimateChange"	latest News,Happening Now,CNN,joe biden,climate change,climate crisis,us news,politics,science	25	News & Politics	PT20M46S	1246	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_4uy_mggrs/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	328132	6894.0	2764.0	0	7838.0	climate crisis	True	0

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab The Green New Deal is an ambitious plan to fight the effects of climate change. It’s the only American plan that actually acknowledges the size of the impending crisis. And it contains some difficult truths that we might not want to hear. Read the Green New Deal resolution here: https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/sites/ocasio-cortez.house.gov/files/Resolution%20on%20a%20Green%20New%20Deal.pdf For additional context I recommend this piece by Vox’s Umair Irfan on the United Nations climate report, where the world’s best climatologists tell us how urgent of a problem this is: https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report This piece from Vox’s David Roberts, shows that world leaders really aren’t taking this urgency seriously. https://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13118594/2-degrees-no-more-fossil-fuels Finally, you should read this explainer of the Green New Deal, followed by this story (in list form) by Hannah Northey: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060106501 I also enjoyed this piece, from Kate Aronoff of the Intercept, that imagines a world after the Green New Deal: https://theintercept.com/2018/12/05/green-new-deal-proposal-impacts/ Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

What is Climate Change? Do you know the facts? No? Well I personally had no idea. One day it just hit me, I knew very little about climate change. Even with a useless degree in chemistry, climate change is a confusing mess of strange and difficult to understand information. I made this video to gather all the facts I could find about climate change, in a fun way, and without any bias on my part. I wanted anyone who watched this video (and myself too!) to understand all the important facts relating to climate change. Non-scientists welcome. Science is exciting! It’s just school and most of our education systems aren’t… In a few months this video will be uploaded as to remove any language or scenes not suitable for schools, so it can be used to teach about climate change in schools.

Sources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesgeoengineering By the end of the 21st century, humanity is becoming desperate. Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan... It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse. What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?

Sea levels have been rising at a greater rate year after year, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates they could rise by another meter or more by the end of this century. As National Geographic showed us in 2013, sea levels would rise by 216 feet if all the land ice on the planet were to melt. This would dramatically reshape the continents and drown many of the world's major cities.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences. It’s impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we’re committed to giving participants a fair go. In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

It’s endless and relentless. We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases?
