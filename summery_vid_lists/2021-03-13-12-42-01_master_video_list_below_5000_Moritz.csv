Help NCSE build their climate change in scripted media database: https://ncse.ngo/understanding-climate-change-scripted-media-project In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, we look at how and why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. We look at the last 30 years of television comedies that address climate change from The Simpsons to South Park to The Good Place to Modern Family to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to understand why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. TV comedies use a number of character archetypes that turn environmentalists into obnoxious pariahs, directly deny the existence of climate change in the case of South Park, or build jokes and comedic elements on how hopeless climate action can be. TV comedies ultimately have undermined needed progress on climate change and climate action by approaching the issue of climate change in an unproductive way. To conclude we offer a number of avenues through which TV comedies like The Simpsons, The Politician, and The Good Place might be able to actually spur climate action through jokes and comedy. Big thanks to Kate Carter and the NCSE graduate student outreach fellows! They researched and wrote the script for this video.

To tackle climate change, a global perspective is needed and this can be provided by satellites. Their data is key if we want to prepare ourselves for the consequences of climate change. While our Earth Explorers gather data to understand how our planet works and understand the impact that climate change and human activity are having on the planet, the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinels provide systematic data for environmental services that help adapt to and mitigate change.

The Paris Agreement of 2015 was supposed to be a definitive milestone reversing the trajectory of human induced global warming. Every country signed up to targets that they pledged to meet. Almost every country has so far failed. Miserably. So people are now taking more and more direct action to start forcing the issue with the sort of urgency that is so desperately required. 2019 may prove to be a seminal year in this struggle and this Easter sees some radical action on the streets of London and around the world. This week we take a look at what's in store. Climate Activism Websites and General Research Websites below...

Climate change is THE existential question that humanity is facing. But are we too late? Has climate change reached the point of no return? Are we doomed? TEACHERS: Get your students in the discussion on KQED Learn, a safe place for middle and high school students to investigate controversial topics and share their voices. ABOVE THE NOISE is a show that cuts through the hype and investigates the research behind controversial and trending topics in the news. Hosted by Myles Bess. *NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY* SUBSCRIBE by clicking the RED BUTTON above. Follow us on Instagram @kqedabovethenoise **What's the state of climate change right now?** Since around 1880, the average global temperature of the earth has increased by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That increase is due almost entirely to humans burning fossil fuels, mostly from 1950 on. That might not sound like a big increase, but it is. It means sea level rise, shrinking polar ice caps, and increased extreme weather events like heat waves and monsoons. That's why a hundred and ninety-plus countries signed onto the Paris Climate Agreement. The goal is to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- by the end of this century. Many scientists say that staying under 1.5 puts us near the upper limit of what's tolerable. We'll have droughts, sea level rise, and extreme weather, but chances are we can manage it. **What does climate change look like in the future?** That's why we have the IPCC. The IPCC is part of the United Nations, and it stands for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It's been the world's top authority on climate science for the last 30 years. Thousands of climate scientists from around the world volunteer their time to analyze and summarize the latest and best climate science. According to these experts, if we keep burning fossil fuels like we are today, then we're blowing past 1.5 degrees of warming by 2100. We'll almost definitely hit 2 degrees, and might even reach 3 or even 4 degrees. That means longer and more intense heat waves. And stronger hurricanes and dangerous flooding. **How do we get climate change under control?** Let's start with transportation. 95% of the vehicles on the planet burn fossil fuels. They're responsible for almost ⅓ of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide! It might sound like a pipe-dream to replace those gas-guzzlers with electric vehicles, but it might not be. In the last decade and a half electric vehicles that don't have any pollution out of the tailpipe went from a dream to commonplace in places like California, China, Norway. Then we have the energy sector -- think power plants. In 2016, 80% of the world's energy came from fossil fuels, while only 5% came from renewables like solar and wind. But we're seeing that change. Now solar is the cheapest form of energy in just two decades. That's a huge change. And then there's how we use land. We're cutting down WAY too many trees and using a lot of that land to raise livestock that we end up eating. The United Nations estimates that if the world stopped getting food from animal sources, greenhouse gas emissions could be cut by one-fourth. SOURCES: Climate Change: How Do We Know?

""XR"" demonstrators have staged spectacular acts of civil disobedience as part of their effort to persuade politicians to take action to reduce global warming. Extinction Rebellion was founded two years ago, and has achieved remarkable success since then. In Germany alone, there are 120 local XR groups and a total of about 20,000 members. The small town of Stroud in southwest England is considered the movement's birthplace. For years, Stroud has been a center of environmental activism in Britain and it is where the founding members live. One of them is Skeena Rathor -- a mother of three who says that she's prepared to go to jail for her beliefs. Another is Gail Bradbrook, who is not above damaging public and private property during protests. Extinction Rebellion activists have paralyzed traffic and chained themselves to fences outside businesses and government offices as part of their demonstrations. One of the co-founders of Extinction Rebellion is Roger Hallam, whose radical activism has sparked controversy. In September 2019, Hallam was arrested and charged with using drones to try to disrupt air traffic at Heathrow Airport. He's also been accused of making comments that appeared to downplay the significance of the Holocaust which led Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany and Britain to distance themselves from Hallam’s statements. XR demands that governments declare a climate- and ecological emergency, and take decisive action to protect the environment. The organization continues to recruit new members, and to prepare them for taking part in acts of non-violent civil disobedience. Extinction Rebellion appears to be politically neutral. Its supporters range from the far left to the far right. But this diversity of views could lead to potentially disruptive policy disputes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

CONTENT: Temperature Will Rise: Climate models predict that Earth’s global average temperate will rise in the future. For the next two decades warming of about 0.2° Celsius is projected. If we continue to emit as many, or more, greenhouse gases, this will cause more warming during the 21st Century than we saw in the 20th Century. During the 21st Century, various computer models predict that Earth’s average temperature will rise between 1.8° and 4.0° Celsius (3.2° and 7.2° F). The amount of predicted warming differs depending on the model emissions scenario (how much greenhouse gas emissions it assumes for the future). The amount of predicted warming also differs between different climate models. Climate change is predicted to impact regions differently. For example, temperature increases are expected to be greater on land than over oceans and greater at high latitudes than in the tropics and mid-latitudes. Changing Precipitation: Warmer average global temperature will cause a higher rate of evaporation, causing the water cycle to “speed up”. More water vapor in the atmosphere will lead to more precipitation. According to models, global average precipitation will most likely increase by about 3-5% with a minimum increase of at least 1% and a maximum increase of about 8%. Yet, changes in precipitation will not be evenly distributed. Some locations will get more snow, others will see less rain. Some places will have wetter winters and drier summers. Melting Snow and Ice: As the climate warms, snow and ice melt. The amount of summer melting of glaciers, ice sheets, and other snow and ice on land are predicted to be greater than the amount of winter precipitation. The amount of sea ice (frozen seawater) floating in the ocean in the Arctic and Antarctic is expected to decrease over the 21st Century too, although there is some uncertainty as to the amount of melt. Rising Sea Level: A warmer climate causes sea level to rise via two mechanisms: (1) melting glaciers and ice sheets (ice on land) add water to the oceans, raising sea level, and (2) ocean water expands as it warms, increasing its volume and thus also raising sea level. During the 20th Century, sea level rose about 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches). Thermal expansion and melting ice each contributed about half of the rise, though there is some uncertainty in the exact magnitude of the contribution from each source. By the year 2100, models predict sea level will rise between about 20 and 50 cm (8 to 20 inches) above late 20th Century levels. Thermal expansion of sea water is predicted to account for about 75% of future sea level rise according to most models. Acidic Ocean Water: Earth's oceans are predicted to act as a buffer against climate change by taking up some of the excess heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is good news in the short run, but more problematic in the long run. Carbon dioxide combined with seawater forms weak carbonic acid. Scientists believe this process has reduced the pH of the oceans by about 0.1 pH since pre-industrial times. Further acidification of 0.14 to 0.35 pH is expected by the year 2100. More acidic ocean water may cause problems for marine organisms. Impacts on Ocean Currents: Large-scale ocean currents called thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in salinity and temperature, may also be disrupted as climate warms. Changes in precipitation patterns and the influx of fresh water into the oceans from melting ice can alter salinity. Changing salinity, along with rising water temperature, may disrupt the currents. In an extreme case, thermohaline circulation could be disrupted or even shut down in some parts of the ocean, which could have large effects on climate.

Script: The Paris climate deal has a lot of people cheering, with world leaders like President Obama painting it as a historic moment…[show short clip from his speech], but what exactly does this agreement do and what does it mean for the world? The major achievement is that for the first time ever virtually all nations committed to reducing their carbon emissions “as soon as possible” and to do their best to keep global warming “to well below two degrees celsius.” If the world can keep temperature rise below two degrees we’ll have a good shot at avoiding the worst. And seeing as though the 1 degree celsius warming that has already occurred has caused us to begin suffering from noticeably more severe weather, this agreement is long overdue. The problem is that it’s not legally binding: it doesn’t create rigid timelines for countries to meet their pledges, pledges that vary wildly from country to country--especially for the BRIC nations that are still developing and are understandably wary of sacrificing their own economic growth for the greater planetary good. That’s why pledges initially made in this deal aren’t anywhere near enough to meet the 2 degree goal. But getting every country to commit to at least some kind of carbon reduction represents huge progress. Wealthier nations, basically the US and Europe, will also contribute significant amounts of money toward helping poorer countries develop clean power systems and reduce deforestation, which is the second largest contributor to climate change after the burning of fossil fuels. The agreement also establishes a transparent method for measuring and assessing how well each country is meeting its targets. And Nations have committed to coming back every five years with new targets that should get increasingly more ambitious as the pace of technological development continues to advance. So even though the Paris agreement didn’t do nearly enough to make sure the problem will be solved once and for all, the bottom line is that, by acting with one unified voice, the governments of the world finally sent a clear message: that the days of burning fossil fuels will quickly be coming to an end. This is what President Obama alluded to when he said: “this agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future. And that has the potential to unleash investment and innovation in clean energy at a scale we have never seen before.” Companies like Shell, Exxon and BP, and countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf neighbors are going to have to rapidly shift their revenue models toward clean energy, or risk being left behind. Although America was a leader in achieving this result, our work is just beginning. We’ve got to continue to defeat the fossil fuel industry’s attempts to undercut efforts to fight climate change here at home. And the most obvious battle will take place on November 8, 2016, when we can elect a congress and a President who will take the torch from President Obama and continue the clean energy transformation of the world’s largest economy. So that’s what the Paris Climate Agreement is all about--it’s up to us to decide whether it will indeed represent a moment of incredible progress for mankind. Thanks for watching.

More than a thousand people have lost their lives so far and tens of thousands have been rendered homeless due to continuous heavy rainfalls and rising flood levels. Floods have affected 11 states in India, including in areas which have never experienced it before. What really are the causes for the increased incidents of flooding in India? Are these seasonal phenomena becoming worse as the years go by? Can India mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and flooding without jeopardising its economic growth objectives and pull millions out of poverty? And how long can the poor bear the brunt of the devastation caused by the extreme weather events?

The tropical rainforest. When we hear this, maybe we think of steamy jungles of Indonesia and Malaysia, the Amazon, Borneo, Java, Bali, the Congo of Central Africa, or the lush islands of the South Pacific. See this part of the planet like you've never seen it before, in an original new earth documentary, exploring the geography of our planet's equatorial zone. I'll explain how it is that this region experiences huge amounts of rain all year round, the biodiversity that results from the combination of all this rain in this tropical heat, and the countries and cities that lie within its influence. The first episode in a geography series showcasing our beautiful planet, themed by all its major climate zones, here we show this part of the world in its full beauty, and uncover the secrets of why it is that way.

Over and over again. And far too many leaders have refused to listen. And far too few have acted with the vision the science demands.” He said noted that “as climate change intensifies, we will find it harder to feed ourselves” causing “more and more people will be forced to migrate from their homes as the land they depend on becomes less able to support them.” He added that “this is already leading to local conflicts over dwindling resources.” Guterres called on governments, businesses, scientists and that will put the planet on a path to a better future. He said “the commitments made so far by Parties to the Paris Agreement represent just one-third of what is needed. The mountain in front of us is very high. But it is not insurmountable. We know how to scale it. Put simply, we need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action.” Guterres also outlined his vision for a new Climate Summit in 2019, which he will be convening to rally the international community, to step up action in key areas inclusive sustainable energy production, economic growth, green investment and better stewardship of natural resources. He said, “enormous benefits await humankind if we can rise to the climate challenge” and added that the argument that tackling climate change is expensive and could harm economic growth “is hogwash.” In fact, he said “the opposite is true.” The call for greater ambition on climate action comes amid record temperature rises and extreme weather events across the globe. The last few months alone saw devastating floods in southern India, wildfires in the United States and extreme heatwaves in Japan. Guterres said, “we stand at an existential crossroad. If we are to take the right path – the only sensible path -- we will have to muster the full force of human ingenuity” and stressed that “technology is on our side in the battle to address climate change.” He pointed out that “the transition to a cleaner, greener future needs to speed up” and said that infrastructure investment must be “sustainable or we will lock in a high-polluting dangerous future.” Guterres said “every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants -- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth. Our fate is in our own hands. The world is counting on all of us to rise to the challenge before it’s too late.” When world leaders signed the historic Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, they pledged to stop temperatures rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and as close to 1.5 degrees, as possible. But scientists and a major UN study, indicate that the target is already well off-track. The UN chief’s message also comes ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit, to be held on the west coast of the United States, in San Francisco, from 12-14 September. National, regional and municipal leaders will gather with business people and philanthropic communities to underscore their commitment to climate action.

Consequently, encouraging human ingenuity and individual action in order to protect our world. Dr James Rae is a climate scientist in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews. His research uses the chemistry of sediments, ice, and fossils to reconstruct past climate change. He’s particularly interested in the drivers of the ice ages, the climates of the dinosaurs, and reconstructing CO2 over geological time. Before coming to St Andrews, James held a prestigious NOAA Climate and Global Change fellowship at Caltech, and studied at the Universities of Bristol and Oxford. In 2015, James won the European Geosciences Union Outstanding Young Scientist Award in Biogeochemistry, for his contributions to understanding past climate change and its causes. When not in his lab in the Purdie Building, you can find him running, surfing, or biking in the Scottish great outdoors, and occasionally playing the bagpipes. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In US news and current events today, NowThis News is looking back on the biggest moments of the year in climate activism and the fight against climate change. This is how young climate crisis activists changed the world. One of the biggest moments of the year was when teen climate activist and Fridays for Future founder Greta Thunberg spoke at the United Nations. This became known as the Greta Thunberg How Dare You speech and launched many Greta Thunberg How Dare You memes and GIFs. Thunberg launched one of the biggest climate strikes, the global school strike 4 climate. In the fight against global warming one of the biggest global issues today also referred to as the climate crisis, no action was too small.

As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country.” He was speaking before the US Congress to confront the defining issue of his time – slavery. Everyone knew it had to end but no one had the political will to stop it. Remarkably, his words ring as true today when applied to the defining crisis of our time – Climate Change. As a UN Messenger of Peace, I have traveled all over the world for the last two years documenting how this crisis is changing the natural balance of our planet. I have seen cities like Beijing choked by industrial pollution. Ancient Boreal forests in Canada that have been clear cut and rainforests in Indonesia that have been incinerated. In India, I met farmers whose crops have literally been washed away by historic flooding. In America, I have witnessed unprecedented droughts in California and sea level rise flooding the streets of Miami. In Greenland and in the Arctic I was astonished to see that ancient glaciers are rapidly disappearing well ahead of scientific predictions. All that I have seen and learned on this journey has absolutely terrified me. There is no doubt in the world’s scientific community that this a direct result of human activity and that the effects of climate change will become astronomically worse in the future. You know that climate change is happening faster than even the most pessimistic of scientists warned us decades ago. It has become a runaway freight train bringing with it an impending disaster for all living things. Now think about the shame that each of us will carry when our children and grandchildren look back and realize that we had the means of stopping this devastation, but simply lacked the political will to do so. Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Massive change is required, now. One that leads to a new collective consciousness. A new collective evolution of the human race, inspired and enabled by a sense of urgency from all of you. We all know that reversing the course of climate change will not be easy, but the tools are in our hands – if we apply them before it is too late. Now is the time for bold unprecedented action. It is time to ask each other – which side of history will you be on? As a citizen of our planet, it is time to declare no more talk. No more excuses. No more ten-year studies. No more allowing the fossil fuel companies to manipulate and dictate the science and policies that affect our future. Lincoln’s words still resonate to all of us here today:“We will be remembered in spite of ourselves. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last generation… We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.” That is our charge now – you are the last best hope of Earth. We ask you to protect it.

Dare to see it and it'll never be the same for you. Full video in Spanish: https://youtu.be/3X-Z0kMfh4M Climate change is a global challenge that has no borders and to combat it requires coordinated work by all countries.

Subscribe to our channel here: https://goo.gl/31Q53F An investigation by Newsnight in conjunction with Greenpeace has found that the government agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), has helped to finance oil and gas projects that, when completed, will emit 69 million tonnes of carbon a year. according to government estimates. That equates to nearly a sixth of the UK’s domestic estimated carbon emissions. This is despite a government commitment to cut down on carbon emissions. Boris Johnson has announced that the UK would no longer finance coal mining or coal-fired power plants abroad. Newsnight’s investigation found all of UKEF's current fossil fuel financing was for oil and gas projects, and not coal. It also found that - since 2010 - UKEF has financed £6bn of fossil fuel projects. Financing has been provided to some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world. James Clayton investigates.

That's the view of Bjorn Lomborg, who's been named one of the most influential people of the 21st century. Lomborg, who has his own think tank and has written several books on the issue, admits that climate change is real, but says the Paris accord is a tiny way of doing something about global warming. He argues that it will solve just one percent of the problem at a very high cost. Lomborg argues that what we should be doing instead is investing the money into research and development of green energy, which needs to be made cheaper than fossil fuels.

Floods, cyclones and droughts are likely to increase as the Earth warms. Poor farmers are already trying to adapt. Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2Hea5EK Melting glaciers, droughts, rising sea-levels - these are just some of the environmental disruptions that are likely to worsen with climate change. But dangerous climate change is not just something that might happen in the future. The earth is already warmed by almost 1 degree Celsius since the dawn of the Industrial Age - the effects are already being felt now. Vulnerable communities are trying to adapt. Bangladesh is more at risk from climate change than almost any other country. It's prone to flooding, cyclones and drought. Climate change may already be exacerbating those things. Bangladesh sits at the bottom of a Delta plane were three main rivers converge. It's straddled by the melting Himalayan glaciers in the north and the rising waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south. That makes it highly susceptible to flooding. In 2009, cyclone Aila tore through Bangladesh, uprooting trees, flattening homes and destroying crops. Along the southern coastal regions the storm left behind salty water in areas it had inundated. Fields that had once support agriculture were deemed useless. To adapt to their newly saline environment, locals have had to change their source of food production. Through a project funded by the World Bank villagers have switched to raising crabs which thrive in saltwater. Villagers rear the crabs and sell them at a local market where they're then resold by buyers who shipped them to Dakha. Adding to this problem, in some areas farmers deliberately inundate their lands with salty water so they can farm shrimp rather than crops, which is more profitable but problematic for the environment. But the salinity creates another daunting problem - it pollutes local groundwater and makes it more difficult to access safe drinking water. Climate change is worsening this effect. Cyclones are more common, river flow has diminished, and salty water from the Bay of Bengal has been reaching ever farther into the coastal lands travelling up rivers and polluting freshwater supplies that are used for drinking and irrigation. NGOs working with the Community Climate Change Project has sought to address this problem. They've provided water tanks so locals can harvest rainwater and have helped fund a desalination plant that provides clean drinking water. In the north of the country, local livelihoods have also been threatened by water. Many villagers are beholden to the rivers. When the rivers flood, the soil used for agriculture has disappeared. Not only have they lost their homes and their crops but also their means of survival. In Ranpur, villagers have learned a new farming technique that works on sandbars or chars where all the soil has been eroded. Farmers dig out holes in the char fill them with compost and plant pumpkins. Pumpkins are preserved and can be sold during the rainy season providing income throughout the year. Adaptation projects such as the ones being carried out in Bangladesh have had a huge impact on those involved but Bangladesh is not the only place where the effects of climate change are already being felt and adapted to. Rotterdam is building floating pavilions to pilot a city that rises with its sea levels. London will improve the Thames Barrier so it can better protect the city from floods. A decade ago adaptation was almost taboo in international discussions about climate change because it was believed to distract attention from the vital task of stopping global warming altogether. Now those are recognized as important. But can keep them in poor countries like Bangladesh adapt quickly enough? We don't know yet. Richer countries are better able to withstand the potential shocks that climate change will bring. If change is slow enough, it gives people more time to act and increases the odds of success. World leaders tend to talk about stopping climate change. It would help poor farmers enormously if it could only be slowed down. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

This promising new route provides a welcome opportunity to bypass the far longer southern route that connects Korea, Japan, and China with the West, through pirate-infested waters. The southern route, which carries 90% of petroleum, fishery products, and other trade, is a vital lifeline for Asia, but a northern route through the Bering Sea and across the North Pole is 40% shorter and could be a boon for trade. The Russians are leading the race for a safe summer route that travels through their newly booming ports, but other countries, including Japan, Canada, Germany, and Korea, are catching up. As the ice melts each summer, these countries are stepping up to find a profitable way to take advantage of an unexpected benefit of global climate change. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Subscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ Join the club and become a Free Documentary Patron: https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary Facebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG Twitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ #FreeDocumentary #Documentary #IceRace ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Free Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.

By the end of the century, 75% of the world's population will experience extreme heat and if current trends continue, whole regions of Asia will be rendered uninhabitable by direct heat. But for many, deadly heat is already part of their daily lives. In this episode, we meet those who are most vulnerable to heat - schoolchildren in Sumba, the elderly in Singapore and slum-dwellers in Delhi - and learn how heat is a silent killer.

While rural and coastal areas have been recovering from floods and cyclones, climate change has wreaked havoc on the South Asian country’s high-altitude region.

Check out Rand Paul's website here▼ http://www.paul.senate.gov/ Like Rand Paul on Facebook▼ http://www.facebook.com/RandPaul Follow Rand Paul on Twitter▼ http://twitter.com/RandPaul Follow Rand Paul on Instagram▼ http://instagram.com/drrandpaul/ A Short Bio on Rand Paul Senator Rand Paul, M.D. is one of the nation’s leading advocates for liberty. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, Dr. Paul has proven to be an outspoken champion for constitutional liberties and fiscal responsibility. As a fierce advocate against government overreach, Rand has fought tirelessly to return government to its limited, constitutional scope. A devoted husband and father, Dr. Paul and his family live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Rand owned his own ophthalmology practice and performed eye surgery for 18 years. As a hard-working and dedicated physician--not a career politician--Rand Paul came to Washington to shake things up and to make a difference. Dr. Paul has been married for 24 years to Kelley Ashby Paul of Russellville, Kentucky, and together, they have three sons: William, 21; Duncan, 18; and Robert, 15. He regularly volunteered to coach teams for each of his three sons in Little League baseball, soccer, and basketball. Rand and Kelley are both devout Christians and are active in their local church. Rand is the third of five children born to Carol and Ron Paul. He grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas and attended Baylor University. He graduated from Duke Medical School in 1988. Dr. Paul completed a general surgery internship at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta and completed his residency in ophthalmology at Duke University Medical Center. Upon completion of his training in 1993, Rand and Kelley moved to Bowling Green to start their family and begin his ophthalmology practice. In 1995, Rand founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic, an organization that provides eye exams and surgery to needy families and individuals. Rand is a former president and 17-year member of Lions Clubs International, which is dedicated to preserving sight by providing eyeglasses and surgery to the less fortunate around the world. In recognition of his outstanding and sustained efforts to provide vision care to Kentuckians in need, Lions Clubs International has awarded Rand many of its highest commendations. A large part of Rand's daily work as an ophthalmologist was dedicated to preserving the vision of our seniors. In 2002, The Twilight Wish Foundation recognized Rand for Outstanding Service and Commitment to Seniors. During his free time, Dr. Paul performs pro-bono eye surgeries for patients across Kentucky. Additionally, he provides free eye surgery to children from around the world through his participation in the Children of the Americas Program. Most recently, he traveled to Guatemala on a medical mission trip with the University of Utah's Moran Eye Center. During the week over 200 patients, many of them blind with cataracts had their vision restored by Dr. Paul. Dr. Paul's entrance into politics is indicative of his life’s work as a surgeon: a desire to diagnose problems and provide practical solutions, whether it be in Bowling Green, Kentucky or Washington, D.C. Randal Howard ""Rand"" Paul (born January 7, 1963) is an American physician and politician from Kentucky. In office since 2011, Paul currently serves in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party. He is also a trained ophthalmologist and is the middle son of former U.S. Representative and physician Ron Paul of Texas. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paul attended Baylor University and is a graduate of the Duke University School of Medicine. Paul began practicing ophthalmology in 1993 in Bowling Green, Kentucky and established his own clinic in December 2007. Paul has been considered a supporter of the Tea Party movement, and a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve System. He has opposed NSA mass surveillance of Americans and supports reduced government spending and taxation. He describes himself as ""100% pro-life"" and has cosponsored legislation for the equal protection of the right to life from conception. Paul officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 U.S. presidential election on April 7, 2015."	rand paul,rand,paul,Senator Rand Paul,ron paul,Hillary Clinton,Donald Trump,Rand Paul 2016,trump 2016,tea party conservative,kentucky senator,libertarian politician,libertarian senator,bernie sanders,barack obama,make america great again,republican senator,republican congressman,republican politician,justin amash,conservative,ron pauls son,best senator,paris agreement,climate change	25	News & Politics	PT5M6S	306	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jF5JRXSUBsc/maxresdefault.jpg		47636	587.0	69.0	0	121.0	paris agreement	False	0

Written, directed and animated by Miritte Ben Yitzchak and voiced by British actress Keira Knightley, it urges us all to Act Now before it is too late. The animated short Climate Crisis, and Why We Should Panic, is the second of a two-part explainer video series for Extinction Rebellion, focusing on the climate and ecological crisis. Voiced by Keira Knightley, it explains what’s causing climate change, why governments must enter crisis mode to tackle this issue, and what will happen if we don’t do something about it now. It follows the first part - Extinction Emergency, and Why We Must Act Now - which focuses on the ecological crisis. Voiced by Naomie Harris and scored by Brian Eno, it summarises the planet’s biodiversity loss, runaway consumerism and the ecological crisis that now faces us, and how the consequences will affect millions of lives around the world.

This video explains the basics of the Paris Agreement: the international UN treaty of 2015 that aims to tackle climate change head on. It's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with ambition to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. Produced by: @UN Climate Change -------- The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.

Academics call this ""shifting baseline syndrome"" -- the idea that environmental change happens too slowly to trip our alarm bells. Journalist and filmmaker John D. Sutter is directing a longitudinal film series -- BASELINE -- that aims to be an antidote by documenting four locations on the frontlines of change every five years, until 2050. John D. Sutter is an EMMY-nominated documentary filmmaker who is directing “Baseline,” a film series that tells the story of the climate crisis beyond a human lifetime. He is an Explorer with the National Geographic Society, where he is developing the “Baseline” project. Sutter spent 10 years as a reporter, columnist and producer at CNN, most recently as a senior investigative reporter. He continues to work for CNN as a climate analyst. Sutter’s work has twice been nominated for an EMMY — for science reporting and new approaches to documentary. He is the recipient of the Livingston Award for Young Journalists, the Peabody Award, the Batten Medal for Public Service, the Foreign Press Association Media Award and the Edward R. Murrow Award, among others. He’s a former fellow at Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism and at UnionDocs, a center for documentary art in Brooklyn.

As the economic costs of disasters rise, can the insurance industry cope with the losses? Read more https://econ.st/2ndFMZ3 Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Extreme weather events like these are becoming more frequent. It’s not just causing untold human suffering but also ever-growing economic costs. As the losses pile up, will insurers be able to cope with the damage? In 2017 Hurricane Harvey, mudslides in Sierra Leone, and monsoon floods in South Asia all contributed to the largest year on record for insurance losses - with payouts totalling $144bn. In America for example between 1980 and 2015 you had about five events a year that each cost more than $1bn in damage. Since 2016 it’s been an average of 15 events like this a year. This leaves the insurance industry uniquely exposed and having to pay out a lot of money all at once. Insurers aren’t helped by the obsolete information they rely on either. They find it hard to predict when this happens because their models are not really taking into account climate change. They look at maybe 30, 40 years of data and they assume that the environment within these data, this period, is pretty stable. So these models look at a world that doesn’t really exist anymore. And it’s no surprise what’s now happening to the price of insurance. If you look at the last quarter premiums on property insurance in America rose by 10%. In Australia and New Zealand they rose by about 18%. And at some point premiums may simply become unaffordable especially so as disasters regularly happen in places where people can least afford to pay high premiums. Half of last year’s losses from natural disasters were uninsured. And in America 85% of homeowners have no flood insurance even though half of the population lives near water. Increasing premiums might just lead to even more people being left out in the cold. But there are some more novel solutions. So, for example, Lloyd’s of London has a policy that sends €1,000 per hectare to Spanish olive farmers as soon as the temperatures reach 36 degrees. So these are very simple solutions to put in place, very easy to implement and also quite cheap in fact, which is the main advantage. Rather than compensate the farmers after their losses are reported insurance companies monitor a specific parameter such as rainfall or temperature. When this passes an agreed threshold they pay out a lump sum. Known as parametric insurance, this approach can help the insurance companies cut costs and in turn bring down premiums for the consumer. But as the climate crisis worsens the same challenges are likely to re-emerge. We cannot expect insurers to save us from climate change because the world fundamentally cannot be insured against climate change. However many companies already offer discounts to homeowners who for example install metallic shutters on the windows or flood-proof doors. But they could make a more drastic step. So a city on the coast wants to build flood defences. This will require a lot of money but perhaps insurers maybe in cooperation with banks could offer some financing for them to do that. They can help us design solutions or take measures that will limit losses. And this is really the crucial role they can play.

According to one estimate, natural disasters caused about $340 billion in damage across the world in 2017. And insurers had to pay out a record $138 billion. The $5 trillion global insurance industry plays a huge role in the U.S. economy. Insurance spending in 2017 made up about 11 percent of America’s GDP. So, how will insurance companies remain profitable in an era of climate change? And what does that mean for the rest of us? Natural disasters cost the country $91 billion in 2018, according to a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report's findings are a sign that the changing climate and increasing numbers of extreme weather events are having a significant economic impact, even as the Trump administration continues to undo Obama-era climate regulations. The economic losses in 2018 were due to 14 different natural disasters, ranging from hurricanes to wildfires to winter storms. Eighty percent, or $73 billion, of the total loss was attributable to just three events: Hurricane Michael in Florida, Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas, and wildfires in the West, including California. According to the report, 2018 had the fourth-highest total costs from natural disasters since NOAA started tracking this data in 1980. It also marked the eighth consecutive year with eight or more natural disasters that cost at least $1 billion each. Last year set a new record for wildfire costs, with $24 billion in losses caused by several fires throughout the summer and fall. November's Camp Fire burned over 150,000 acres in northern California alone, destroying homes and businesses. Since 1980, the U.S. has sustained over $1.6 trillion in losses due to natural disasters. The Trump administration has been historically resistant to take action on climate change. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement during his first year in office. The president has dismissed reports on the effects of climate change and mocked the concept of global warming during recent winter storms. ""Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold,"" Trump tweeted last month. ""Wouldn't be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!"" » Subscribe to CNBC: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Animated film. Length: 5'42"" The impacts of climate change destroy people's livelihoods and homes. They damage our infrastructure and disrupt communication and trade. Moreover, climate change is endangering development successes and the poor and marginalized are often affected the most. Even if we were to stop emissions instantly, the world would not stop warming immediately due to the amount of gases we have already emitted. That's why we must do both: reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to inevitable climate change. But how can we adapt, considering that the precise extent and form of climate change aren't known?

On a simple level, music festivals have significant carbon footprints, and efforts to mitigate them are necessary. More intriguingly, though, festivals are an apt testing ground for new ideas in sustainability. Whether it's Houghton's reusable cup scheme, the ""circular waste economies"" at We Love Green and DGTL, or the many other initiatives at events like Gottwood, Terraforma and Meadows In The Mountains, more and more festivals are trialling bold new methods of sustainability, in some cases winning awards for them. It's an encouraging sign of how dance music can play a positive role in the world's response to the climate crisis. In this 10 minute film, we look at a small selection of electronic music festivals rising to this challenge, and examine the ways they're pushing sustainability practices forward. This feature is the start of an ongoing series dedicated to electronic music and the climate crisis. You can also read our feature about what can dance music do about the climate crisis (https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3476) and listen to an audio feature on the sustainability of vinyl (https://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?exchange=465). Our goal is is to inspire discussion and debate about how our community can best contribute to the broader climate movement. RA is working on internal climate-related company goals, which we will share in the coming months.

Thunberg, Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Belgians Anuna de Wever van der Heyden and Adélaïde Charlier arrived at the chancellery for a 90-minute meeting Thursday, the first high-profile talks the youth activists have held with a world leader since the start of the pandemic. The coronavirus outbreak has prevented the Fridays for Future movement that Thunberg inspired from holding its mass rallies in recent months. The activists argue that governments around the world are doing too little to curb emissions of greenhouse gases that are heating up the atmosphere. In a letter sent to world leaders last month, they called for numerous measures including ending financing for oil and gas projects, including all forms of man-made emissions in reduction targets and setting binding carbon budgets. Germany currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union. Merkel has in the past lauded the youth activists for putting pressure on politicians to act against global warming.

In this thorough talk, Dr. Martin examines the intersections of climate change and racism, from who's at the table during policymaking, to which communities are effected by natural disasters, and which receive resources first. Incorporating multidisciplinary data and research, Dr. Martin proposes ways for us to scrutinize bias in ourselves, our workplaces, and our social groups. Dr. Atyia Martin is a Certified Emergency Manager with a diverse set of experiences in public health, emergency management, intelligence, and homeland security. Mayor Martin Walsh appointed her as the Chief Resilience Officer for the City of Boston as part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. In this role, she is responsible for leading the development and implementation of Boston’s Resilience Strategy. Boston will focus on advancing racial equity as the foundation of the Resilience Strategy process. Dr. Martin has served as adjunct faculty in the Master of Homeland Security at Northeastern University. She was previously the Director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the Boston Public Health Commission. Her previous professional experience includes the Boston Police Department’s Boston Regional Intelligence Center; City of Boston’s Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management; the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI); and active duty Air Force assigned to the National Security Agency. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In fact, 97 percent of published reports agree that climate change is fuelled by manmade greenhouse gases. But while there is overwhelming consensus within the scientific community, climate change remains a contentious topic in politics in the United States. In this episode, TechKnow examines the debate over climate change. Lindsay Moran travels to Washington, DC to look at what is at stake in the debate. Politicians fall into two camps: those who believe in human-induced climate change and those who don't. When asked why climate change is so politically charged, John Holden, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, tells us: ""I think the most fundamental reason is this misperception that being in favour of addressing the climate change challenge is to be against jobs and the economy."" Shini Somara heads to Miami, Florida, where there simply isn't time for a debate over whether climate change is a legitimate threat. The state is already facing the immediate effects of rising sea levels. According to climate scientist Ben Kirtman, Florida is the epicentre for climate change impacts. Rising sea levels are already affecting the lives of Miami coastline residents. Some have faced property damage from rising water, while others reflect on the reality of relocation. ""I've been here for my entire lifetime,"" says Dan Kipnis, a Miami resident and environmental activist. ""I know for a fact I'm going to have to leave."" Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine says he cannot afford to be concerned with the politics of climate change. ""As mayor I don't have the liberty or time to debate why climate change is happening. All I have is the opportunity to fix it,"" he says. ""That bay is not Republican, it's not Democrat, it knows no limits."" City officials are moving quickly to keep the city dry by installing pumps and raising buildings and streets. The infrastructure is expensive, and applying for funding from the state or federal level again highlights the political divides surrounding climate change. ""When they are trying to get resources from the state of Florida,"" says climate scientist Ben Kirtman, ""they can't really talk about the climate change part of it."" - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/"	Al Jazeera English,News,climate change,al Jazeera,politics,environment,jazeera,TechKnow,US Politics,youtube,climate change politics,climate,change,politics of climate change,climate change usa,usa climate change,climate change 2016,us climate change,global warming,climate change and politics	25	News & Politics	PT24M8S	1448	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wYJ9ChqFZs/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	11611	131.0	8.0	0	47.0	climate crisis	False	0

Come explore the vast interactive network of plants, animal, and insects in tropical rainforests. Fueled by sunlight and rain, rainforests are some of the most diverse energy-rich ecosystems on the planet. In addition to showcasing live footage from a unique ecosystem, each of the three videos in the Exploring Ecosystems series features an opportunity for students to actively participate in a problem-solving scenario based on an ongoing research project of an Academy scientist like Michelle Trautwein. As you watch the video, be prepared to pause at key points to participate fully! Explore arthropods, insects like Leafcutter ants (Atta colombica or Atta cephalotes) or katydids (Tettigoniidae), and amphibians like the Poison Dart Frog (Dendrobatidae). The Tropical Rainforest Diversity video investigates the following questions: How does the biodiversity within an ecosystem influence the stability of that ecosystem? How can we make rainforests more resilient to change and human-induced disruptions like deforestation and climate change? What are the four main layers of the rainforest, and how are the conditions within each allowing certain species to thrive? Check for Understanding Which of the three hypothetical rainforest communities was most diverse, and why is that important? Connect your answer to the ideas of species richness and species abundance, being sure to differentiate the two. Key Scientific Terms abiotic: non-living biodiversity: the variety of life on Earth or some other specified geographic region of the planet; the diversity of life occurs at the genetic level, at the species level, at the ecosystem level, and in evolutionary lineages ecosystem: the community of different species in a particular geographic area and all of their interactions with each other and the physical environment; ecosystems are also called ecological networks photosynthesis: the process of capturing the energy in sunlight to create energy-rich organic molecules from inorganic molecules; organisms that photosynthesize are called photosynthesizers species: a distinct type of organism species richness: the number of different species in a given geographic area Connections to High School Standards AP Biology (1) Justify the selection of mathematical routines to solve problems. (2) Apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural phenomena. Essential knowledge 4.C.4: The diversity of species within an ecosystem may influence the stability of the ecosystem.

Scientists at the Woods Hole Research Center tell us how they estimate the biomass of rainforests from space in an effort to preserve them. Toucans in the Forest Ecosystem http://www.calacademy.org/explore-science/toucans-in-the-forest-ecosystem From the smallest microbe to the fiercest predator to the tallest tree, each species contributes to making its community healthy. Learn how every organism plays a part in ecosystems. More from the Exploring Ecosystems Series In this video series, students participate in problem-solving exercises as they explore how species interact with one another and their environment. While the rainforest video covered biodiversity, the below tutorials discuss coastal food web and mutualistic relationships, respectively.

The word ‘retirement’ usually implies sitting back, relaxing and winding down - but Fi's TEDx talk challenges this assumption, exploring instead the wisdom, experience and free time that older generations in particular, can bring to critical problems. Fi says, ""We, the Elders, have a key role to play. Do all that you can in the active years you have left. We owe it to the children to leave them the best legacy we can – a sustaining, diverse and inhabitable planet"". One of the earliest members of campaign group Grandparents for a Safe Earth, Fi has spent the last decade committed to environmental activism. Last year, aged 70, Fi joined Extinction Rebellion on the streets of London. Previously a very law-abiding citizen, she was arrested in Oxford Circus, and continues to lead young and old in environmental actions across the country. In her earlier years Fi studied Modern Languages at Oxford University, worked as a librarian and raised two sons. She has been happily married to her husband Andrew for 50 years. #ExtinctionRebellion Credits: Our talks and films are produced, filmed and edited by a brilliant team of talented volunteers and pro-bono partners: Directed and Produced by Mel Rodrigues, Creative Director TEDxBristol Production Manager: Clare Crossley Filmed and edited by Floating Harbour: Richard da Costa Reuben Gaines Chessie Sharman Raph Watson Tom Young Ben Scrase Dan O'Connell Born in 1948, the eldest of four children, Fi went to St Hilda’s College, Oxford on a full grant to study Modern Languages. Shortly afterwards she married Andrew, the young man she met at a speaking compettiton, that she won. Nearly 50 years later they are still together and during that time Fi has worked as a librarian, raised two sons and given her time to a wide variety of voluntary work, including running a Christian retreat house. Fi’s environmental ‘lightbulb moment’ came while living in France in the early 2000s. It was during this time, when she was engaged in a period of deep spiritual reflection, walking the hills and studying the writing of Marion Woodman and Joanna Macy, that she heard the trees screaming during the heatwave of 2003. Her mounting fear for the natural world and desire to speak out brought her back to Bristol, where she immediately threw herself into environmental activism. A dedicated member of ‘Grandparents for a Safe Earth’, over the last decade she has dressed up as a polar bear, a spider monkey and an orangutan, signed hundreds of petitions, lobbied her MP and occupied the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for six hours in June 2018. Since its launch in October 2018, Fi has been an active member of Extinction Rebellion. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Subscribe to our channel here: https://goo.gl/31Q53F The number of fires in the Amazon rose by a third last year, according to the latest figures released this month. Environmental campaigners and indigenous groups have warned that the policies of Brazil’s populist leader Jair Bolsonaro have heavily contributed to the fires and to the destruction of the rainforest. Indigenous Chief Raoni Metuktire gathered leaders from across the Amazon to make a stand against further incursion into their lands. The assembled delegates drew up a manifesto to present to the government in Brasilia. International editor Gabriel Gatehouse reports.

The world reached a historic deal 5 years ago, with 195 countries signing the Paris Climate Agreement. For the first time, there was a global treaty that truly tackled the urgency of climate change. And yet, it was deemed weak because it was all voluntary. Bloomberg's Akshat Rathi explains why the agreement's weakness is also its strength.

She discusses the impacts of climate change on her home country, Honduras, and how she discovered the intersections between these two issues. Far too often we talk about the effect of climate change on the planet, and she wants to change the narrative and talk about how it will impact the most marginalized communities around the world. Adriana is a fourth year student in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. She's originally from Honduras, in Central America and is passionate about social justice, climate change and food security. She's a member of Love Intersections, a group of queer, people of colour who believe that story telling is a powerful agent of change. She's been very involved with sustainability initiatives at UBC and currently works for AMS Sustainability. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Can we humans save the planet from ourselves? In a new film, alumni Sir David Attenborough and Dr Jane Goodall DBE, and leading Cambridge University researchers, talk about the urgency of the climate crisis – and some of the solutions that will take us towards zero carbon. If we are to avoid climate disaster we must sharply reduce our carbon dioxide emissions starting today – but how? Cambridge researchers describe their work on generating and storing renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, understanding the impact of climate policies, and probing how we can each reduce our environmental impact. We hear how the ambitious new programme Cambridge Zero is bringing together ideas and innovations to tackle the global challenge of climate catastrophe – and inspiring a generation of future leaders – and how the University is looking at its own operations to develop a zero carbon pathway for the future.

The current generation of high school and college-aged young adults is the first that has grown up with an awareness of climate change and its potential consequences.  How does this generation perceive climate change and its own future given that perception? How does education in climate change alter those perceptions? This talk examines the perception of climate change, its potential consequences on the future of high school students (age 16-18) before and after being educated on the evidence, and mitigation strategies of climate change. Bio: Mr. Isaac is a lifelong educator. His life path has taken him on a wild ride from working as a sailing instructor to banker; to “working” as a stay at home dad, firefighter, and EMT to finally finding and fulfilling his passion in high school science education. Strident about the education of young minds, project-based learning, and earth and space sciences, Mr. Isaac strives to get young minds to open to the amazing world around them: “Get your head out of your phone,” he admonishes them. Mr. Isaac, the oldest faculty member at South Fayette High School, has been teaching for only seven years. He enjoys the responsibility and latitude of being the old guy that never follows the rules.

Hal Harvey, an energy and climate expert, explains how net-zero buildings and improved building codes are key to lowering emissions. Buildings consume about 40 percent of all energy, and too much of that energy is wasted. Architects and builders can lower energy needs with better insulation, better windows, more thermal mass and overhangs.

Its effects are showing. India has witnessed droughts, floods, low yields, high temperature, erratic rains. But are we responsible for it? Or are we victims, paying the price for the development trajectory of other rich countries? Is it fair to ask India to cut its greenhouse gas emissions, which may come at the cost of development? Or is there a way to bridge the development and environment binary? How has India’s international stance evolved? To discuss a range of these issues, Navroz Dubash, editor of the most comprehensive book on climate change and India, joins this edition of The Big Picture.

By generating a holistic understanding of Earth’s ecosystems, we transform our ability to understand climate change, and identify the best strategies to address it. With this in mind, Crowther and his team of 25 researchers are looking at ways to digitally explore the biosphere and reveal the true potential of nature-based solutions in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. Advances in data collection and artificial intelligence are revealing more truths about our environment and the seriousness of climate change. At the same time, it’s also helping to find new solutions that harness the power of nature itself. The Crowther Lab research is helping organizations understand the true value of nature, make more informed decisions, and start implementing nature-based solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss. Get ready to discover a new approach to Climate Change. Thomas Crowther, professor of Global Ecosystem Ecology at ETH Zurich and founder of the Crowther Lab is different to most environmental scientists. While most labs in the world focus on one field of research, Crowther firmly believes that to understand the ecological processes that influence climate change, predict its progression with high accuracy, and develop nature-based solutions to address it, we need to take a holistic approach. Specialising in ecosystem ecology, Crowther is also the chief scientific advisor to the UN’s Trillion Tree Campaign.

Her score lets us hear decades of Arctic sea ice loss in just minutes. In the beautiful and sometimes discordant piano piece, played by Kristina Lee, numerical scientific data becomes an emotional experience intended to reconnect us to the rhythm of the planet. Judy Twedt is a fifth-generation Washingtonian who pursued a PhD in atmospheric sciences at the UW to better understand the physics of global climate change. Three years into her research after the reversal of US participation in the Paris Climate Accord, she designed a new PhD program to develop novel ways to increase comprehension of our changing climate — by listening to the vital signs of the planet. She uses climate data to create climate soundtracks with three-dimensional, spatialized sound fields. These soundtracks explore tensions between the time-scales of human experience and that of climate change. She mixes art and science to promote public reckoning with our changing climate and its associated risks. She has received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; the University of Washington's Husky 100 and Husky Green Awards for her work in sustainability and science communication. She enjoys swimming in the Puget Sound, making pies and addressing big multi-disciplinary problems.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg had two very different messages to give over climate change. Our Park Hee-jun has more. Two of the most high-profile attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos ensured it was impossible to miss the annual meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump and teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg,... carried on their indirect debate on climate change. In his keynote speech on Tuesday, local time,... President Trump revealed that the U.S. will join the initiative to plant one trillion trees. ""Today, I'm pleased to announce the United States will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum. One trillion trees."" While this year's forum is focused on how businesses must change to save the planet,... President Trump's more than 30-minute long speech was devoted to highlighting the importance of the oil and gas industries,... with promises on climate change nowhere to be found. Instead, he warned against listening to the ""prophets of doom."" ""This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism in action. But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse."" Sitting in the audience for the speech was Thunberg. Speaking shortly after President Trump's special address, the Swedish activist took aim at Trump and other world leaders, accusing them of doing nothing and making empty promises on climate change. ""You say children shouldn't worry. You say just leave this to us. We will fix this. We promise we won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic. And then, nothing. Silence. Or something worse than silence. Empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken."" She also criticized the lack of action to reduce carbon emissions when the world is in her words ""on fire"". ""I wonder what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing a climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions, without even trying? Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour."" Their mutual dislike of each other has been in the spotlight since last year. Their last encounter was at the UN last September. Photos and videos of Thunberg glaring at President Trump as he passed by after the climate change summit went viral at the time. It was followed by a tweet by the American leader, saying Thunberg should work on her anger management issues.

It's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with ambition to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.

The trees are much taller and denser, so the carbon content of the African rainforest is as much as double as that of the Amazon. So in terms of climate change, the African rainforest/ Congo Basin is twice as important as its surface area. There is a clear link between the rainforest of Eastern Dem. Republic of Congo and the rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands. So if we cut down the forests of DRC, not only will we put more CO2 in to the atmosphere, but Ethiopia will also loose its rainfall. It's likely that the same relationship will apply to Gabon and Congo, and the Sahel. In all the rainforest models they predict that in the next 20 - 30 years, Sahel will loose half of its rain fall, because of climate change. So we a responsibility in the Congo Basin, the DRC, The Congo and Gabon, because we know that the people in Sahel will die if we cut down the rainforest.

Billed the “affair of the century”, the legal case was brought by four NGOs who accused the French state of not living up to its own commitments - including a multi-year plan to cut carbon emissions - or to the 2015 Paris Climate accord. This was the first time a French court has ruled that the state can be held responsible for its climate commitments ramping up pressure on other countries to act on global warming as well. The court ordered the state to pay each of the four organizations a symbolic amount of one euro in compensation. #France #Climate #Court 📣 Arirang News(Facebook) : https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews 📣 Arirang News(Twitter) : https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews 📣 News Center(YouTube) : https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV 2021-02-04, 07:00 (KST)	arirang,korean,South Korea,Arirang News,news,Seoul,arirang tv,아리랑tv,아리랑뉴스,뉴스,북한,north korea,대한민국,미국,U.S.,policy,politics,정치,정책,경제,economy,스포츠,날씨,weather,이슈,월드,world,global,issue,sports,프랑스,법원,정부,기후,변화,환경,책임,배상,글로벌,court,France,climate,change,government,guilty,environment,carbon,emission,compensation	25	News & Politics	PT37S	37	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9j9jw8N2Jw/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	153	9.0	1.0	0	3.0	climate crisis	False	0

Climate change is arguably the greatest challenge of our time. Human activity has already warmed the planet by one degree Celsius relative to pre-industrial times, and we are feeling the effects through record heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, the planet will reach two degrees of warming by 2050 - the threshold that many scientists have identified as a dangerous tipping point. What is the science behind these projections? Join climate scientist expert Michael Mann to learn about the basic scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. We need to understand the science in order to solve the broader environmental, societal and economic changes that climate change is bringing. By the end of this course, you will: -Develop a deep scientific understanding of HOW the climate system has been changing; -Articulate WHY the climate system is changing; -Understand the nature of these changes; -Develop a systems thinking approach to analyzing the impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems.	edX,edx.org,free online courses,free courses online,free courses,free classes,online classes,online courses free,online college courses,online college classes,free online classes,education,free education,online education,massive open online course,MOOC,MOOC courses,online learning,lifelong learning,free online learning,free university courses,MIT online courses,distance learning,distance education,certificates,free college courses,Harvard,MIT	27	Education	PT2M15S	135	2d	hd	False	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vP00TP6-p0/maxresdefault.jpg	1.0	5320	78.0	29.0	0	3.0	climate crisis	False	0
