The arctic has been warming up for years - and now, the warnings of experts and scientists are clear for everyone to see - the poles are melting. As the differences in temperature between the poles and the equatore reduce, the jetstream winds, which move weather around the globe - are slowing down. The result - extreme weather. High- and low pressure systems remain at the same spot for longer, creating floods and droughts.

""Well, I don't think science knows actually,"" Trump added. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi A California environmental official challenged President Donald Trump to believe and follow the science on climate change after Trump suggested that record-breaking temperatures in the state would cool down on their own. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch,” Trump said after Wade Crowfoot, California’s secretary for natural resources, urged him and others not to “put our head in the sand” and simply ignore the warming climate. Trump’s remark during a roundtable in McLellan Park, California, on the wildfires that have engulfed huge swaths of the state, generated laughs from some of the participants. But Crowfoot responded: “I wish science agreed with you.” Trump, with a smirk, shot back: “OK, well, I don’t think science knows, actually.” The White House declined CNBC’s request for further comment on the president’s remarks. Crowfoot tweeted later Monday: “It actually won’t get cooler Mr. President. #ClimateChangeIsReal.” Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, struck a very different tone on the issue. “With every bout with nature’s fury, caused by our own inaction on climate change, more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, on coastlines and farmlands,” Biden said, according to his prepared remarks. “It is happening everywhere. It is happening now. It affects us all,” Biden said. The president has largely blamed the wildfires, which continue to blaze in parts of California, on poor forest management practices. He said at the roundtable, which also included Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, that he had been told by the leader of a “major country” in Europe, ”‘We have trees that are far more explosive’ – explosive in terms of fire – ‘... than they have in California, and we don’t have any problem.’” Trump in the past has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax.” But Crowfoot stressed in his remarks Monday that boiling temperatures in parts of California are part of a larger trend. “We’ve had temperatures explode this summer. You may have learned that we broke a world record in the Death Valley – 130 degrees [Fahrenheit]. But even in greater L.A., 120-plus degrees. And we’re seeing this warming trend make our summers warmer, but also our winters warmer, as well,” Crowfoot said. “I think one area of mutual agreement and priority is vegetation management, but I think we want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forest, and actually work together with that science, that science is going to be key.” “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot said. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

But an issue that may have received less attention is just how long this process lasts. Even if humans stopped emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere tomorrow, the expansion effect would continue in the oceans for centuries more, making it effectively irreversible in our lifetimes.” How Eating Seaweed Can Help Cows to Belch Less Methane https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-eating-seaweed-can-help-cows-to-belch-less-methane “Emissions from the world’s nearly 1.5 billion cattle are a major source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Now, researchers in California and elsewhere are experimenting with seaweed as a dietary additive for cows that can dramatically cut their methane production.” Sign Up For The Seeker Newsletter Here - http://bit.ly/1UO1PxI ____________________ Seeker inspires us to see the world through the lens of science and evokes a sense of curiosity, optimism and adventure.

This success has been achieved despite high beef and soy prices, which in previous years had pushed deforestation upward, and during a time that Brazil had rapid economic growth and made important progress in reducing poverty, hunger, and inequality. Brazil’s reduction in emissions from deforestation is the largest contribution so far by any country—rich or poor—to reducing global warming pollution.” Deforestation: Facts, Causes & Effects http://www.livescience.com/27692-deforestation.html “Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests in order to make the land available for other uses. An estimated 18 million acres (7.3 million hectares) of forest, which is roughly the size of the country of Panama, are lost each year, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).” Tropical Deforestation Affects Rainfall in the U.S. and Around the Globe https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2005/deforest_rainfall.html “Today, scientists estimate that between one-third and one-half of our planet's land surfaces have been transformed by human development. Now, a new study is offering insight into the long-term impacts of these changes, particularly the effects of large-scale deforestation in tropical regions on the global climate.” ____________________ Seeker inspires us to see the world through the lens of science and evokes a sense of curiosity, optimism and adventure.

"Be one of the first 200 people to sign up with this link and get 20% off your subscription with Brilliant.org! https://brilliant.org/OCC/ In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what you can do about climate change using individual, personal, and collective actions. This video, however, is not a simple list of the best things a person can do to change their lifestyle and shrink their carbon footprint, instead I start by looking at the way in which we’ve globally become fixated on individual solutions to climate change. We envision ourselves more as consumers than as citizens. As a result carbon footprint related actions like flying less, zero waste, and recycling are prioritized over voting, protesting, and system change. This video is all about doing both personal things to lower your carbon footprint like driving less, but simultaneously acting collectively to create a system in which having a small carbon footprint is feasible for everyone. Structural change and individual change are both necessary to stop climate change.

A leading climate scientist helps sort fact from fiction and stresses the importance of adapting to an uncertain future. Linda Mortsch has devoted her career to addressing climate change issues. Since 1989, she has played a role in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and is a co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. In 1992, her research project “Adapting to climate variability and change in the Great Lakes Basin” was one of the first to explore adaptation to climate change in Canada. Today, Linda has an adjunct appointment in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo, and has been recognized by a number of associations, including the International Joint Commission, American Geophysical Union, Environment Canada, and more. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

First, create green jobs. Investing in renewable energy could create millions of family sustaining, union jobs and build the infrastructure we need for marginalized communities to access clean water and air. Second, stop dirty energy. A massive investment in renewable energy jobs isn’t enough to combat the climate crisis. If we are going to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we must tackle the problem at its source: Stop digging up and burning more oil, gas, and coal. Third, kick fossil fuel companies out of our politics. For decades, companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP have been polluting our democracy by pouring billions of dollars into our politics and bankrolling elected officials to enact policies that protect their profits. The oil and gas industry spent over $103 million on the 2016 federal elections alone. Fourth, require the fossil fuel companies that have profited from environmental injustice to compensate the communities they've harmed. As if buying off our democracy wasn’t enough, these corporations have also deliberately misled the public for years on the amount of damage their products have been causing. If these solutions sound drastic to you, it’s because they are. They have to be if we have any hope of keeping our planet habitable. The climate crisis is not a far-off apocalyptic nightmare — it is our present day.

Sandstorms are becoming more and more frequent, groundwater levels are sinking and palm trees are shrivelling up and dying. An age-old way of life is in danger. Halim Sbai says an oasis really is a paradise. But drought and desertification are now taking their toll on oases like M'hamid El Ghizlane in southeastern Morocco where he grew up. The survival of a whole region is at stake. Over hundreds of kilometers between the Anti-Atlas mountains and the Sahara desert there is one palm-fringed oasis after the next. Close to two million people live in these settlements. Up to now, many earned their living by harvesting dates from the palm trees. But this is proving more and more difficult. Decreasing and irregular rainfall is having a devastating impact on the trees and their yields. Halim Sbai is planting new palm trees and preserving as much precious water as he can in a bid to keep the oasis of M'hamid El Ghizlane and the region’s traditional way of life alive. Up to now, he has also been supplementing his income with earnings from tourism. Global warming could put an end to all this. ------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Not by rehashing the same data and facts we've been discussing for years, says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. In this inspiring, pragmatic talk, Hayhoe shows how the key to having a real discussion is to connect over shared values like family, community and religion -- and to prompt people to realize that they already care about a changing climate. ""We can't give in to despair,"" she says. ""We have to go out and look for the hope we need to inspire us to act -- and that hope begins with a conversation, today.""

Scientists predict climate change will displace more than 180 million people by 2100 -- a crisis of ""climate migration"" the world isn't ready for, says disaster recovery lawyer and Louisiana native Colette Pichon Battle.

The event near the Colorado state Capitol will include a panel of youth activists and end with a “die-in” that organizers say will symbolize those people facing danger and death because of climate change. Thunberg has staged weekly “Fridays for Future” demonstrations for a year to call for faster action against climate change. She has inspired students around the world to skip classes on Fridays to demonstrate as well. The 16-year-old sailed to the U.S. in August to promote her climate change campaign. She garnered international attention when she scolded world leaders at the United Nations. She’s touring the Americas for several months, concluding with a U.N. climate conference in Chile in December.

In reality, 97 percent of scientists agree that it is real and only 3 percent are skeptical. A sticking point for some is the estimated timeline, but as Columbia University professor Philip Kitcher points out, a 4-5 Celsius temperature increase that makes the planet uninhabitable is a disaster no matter when it happens. In this video, 9 experts (including professors, astronomers, authors, and historians) explain what climate change looks like, how humans have already and are continuing to contribute to it, how and why it has become politicized, and what needs to happen moving forward for real progress to be made. David Wallace-Wells, journalist and New America Foundation National Fellow, says that the main goal of climate action is not to win over the skeptical minority, but to ""make those people who are concerned but still fundamentally complacent about the issue to be really engaged in a way that they prioritize climate change in their politics and their voting and make sure that our leaders think of climate change as a first-order political priority."" Read David Wallace-Wells' latest book The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming at https://amzn.to/2CMDSGI ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSCRIPT: GINA MCCARTHY: Climate is always portrayed on newscasts as being some kind of big debate. You know, the big debate among the scientists is that 97 percent of them know it's happening and are really worried about it. Three percent are skeptical. That's not a balance. That's an overwhelming majority and that needs to drive the decision, especially in a democracy. BILL NYE: The more you think about it everybody, 97 percent of the world's scientists – not 97 percent of some institute that somebody started in a remote part of the world and is releasing press releases. Ninety-seven percent of the scientists in the world are very concerned about climate change. PHILIP KITCHER: Climate science is built on views about the atmosphere that have been developed very successfully and in a very rigorous way from the nineteenth century to the present. There isn't any doubt about the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect. There isn't really any doubt about the evidence behind the consensus that says we have contributed enormously to the warming effects that are now becoming apparent not only in the present but also from the record of the earth's average temperature. NYE: You can look at the graphs. You can study the stuff for yourself. If nothing else do this. Wherever you live, get access to the coldest temperature of each year for the last century. And unless you live in just very few places you will see the coldest temperature where you live has steadily increased. They'll be some dips. There'll be some ups, but overall you'll find it – and that's just one that almost everybody who has internet access can get those data, they're available. And just look at that one thing and you'll see the world's getting warmer everybody. MICHELLE THALLER: Now the reason our atmosphere is getting warmer and warmer and warmer is because we humans are putting lots of carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere. And this acts as what we call a greenhouse gas. Sunlight can get through the atmosphere, but the carbon dioxide traps it and it can't release itself back into space so it gets warmer and warmer over time. Carbon dioxide doesn't just warm the atmosphere. It also affects our oceans. When ocean water combines with carbon dioxide to create something called carbonic acid and it makes the oceans more and more acidic over time. And this is a really big problem for marine life. There are things like algae. The algae in the oceans are responsible for most of the oxygen that we breathe. And the algae are having trouble forming because of the higher acid levels in the ocean. So even if the one thing you solved was cooling the earth down, if we continue to put more and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere there will be other serious repercussions. We could end up killing the ocean life system, for example. NYE: The earth is getting warmer faster than it has ever gotten before and that's the problem. It's not that the world hasn't had more carbon dioxide. It's not that the world hasn't been warmer. The problem is the speed at which things are changing. We are inducing a sixth mass extinction event kind of by accident and we don't want to be the extinctee if I may coin...

The coronavirus brought much of the world to a standstill, dropping carbon emissions by five percent. Al Gore says keeping those rates down is now up to us. In this illuminating interview, he discusses how the steadily declining cost of wind and solar energy will transform manufacturing, transportation and agriculture, offer a cheaper alternative to fossil fuels and nuclear energy and create millions of new jobs. Stay tuned for a lively debate about geoengineering and hear Gore's thoughts about how humanity can create a clean, prosperous future through a focused global effort and a generation of young people committed to change.

I talk about the game's mechanics, the frequency of extreme weather events, and the knock-on effects on human behaviour in the game. In short, the game does a very good job, way beyond a crude depiction of global warming. Thanks to 2K and Firaxis for providing early access to the game! (1) See http://www.trillionthtonne.org/questions.html (2) As ever, SkepticalScience has your back: https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html (3) For a cool interactive report about how hurricanes have changed with anthropogenic climate change, see https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/changes-hurricanes (4) Note here that I'm talking about the mean 'waviness' of the jet stream, leading to more frequent and more intense outbreaks of Arctic air. The recent cold outbreak over North America was likely exacerbated by this effect, but not caused by it - the root cause was a SSW, which current science indicates was not made more likely due to climate change. (5) See e.g. http://oxfordre.com/climatescience/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228620.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228620-e-344 (6) Natural variability in the atmosphere is something of a politicized and so thorny topic. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hockey_Stick_and_the_Climate_Wars for an idea of why I didn't want to delve into this in detail. There are a few things which I didn't mention in the video because I recorded it in a great hurry. Here are three of them. Firstly the game only specifically addresses CO2 emissions rather than a multitude of gases such as methane - this is technically inaccurate but I can understand why they simplified it. Secondly I didn't talk about any quantitative aspects of X emissions equating to Y warming or Z sea ice loss as that would require a standardised unit of emissions in the game, which it doesn't provide! Besides, there's no reason to believe that all other geophysical parameters would be the same as our Earth, making any kind of quantitative analysis difficult at best (and, to be honest, not that interesting!). Lastly, arguably the most unrealistic part of the game is that all world leaders in it believe that climate change is a significant issue!

The thicker layer of greenhouse gases traps more heat. This result in an increase in average temperature of the earth and the earth becomes hotter and hotter. This is called global warming. If we do not take steps to reduce global warming, it will lead to loss of human lives, plants and animals. Steps to reduce global warming: Plant more trees. Reduce, reuse and recycle. Use less hot water. Turn off electronic devices when not in use. Spread awareness. Come on everybody, let us reduce global warming.

The Amazon Rainforest is big news right now as fires continue to consume its lush landscape. It’s essential to our planet’s climate, ecosystem, and more. If we do nothing, the Amazon could be gone within 100 years. What would that mean for us? Well, did you know that a lot of the ingredients in our modern medicines come from the plants of the Amazon? These include the most important medications, such as essential vaccines. Millions of people depend on the Amazon basin for their income. So it would certainly be devastating for South American people. Also, if the fires continue, not only will we lose the huge oxygen source, but extra pollution will be released. And that is not all!

If it was suddenly gone, a lot of South America’s exports and businesses would disappear with it. - Our planet gets 20% of its oxygen from this Rainforest, due to its massive size. - Covering just over 2 million square miles, the Amazon is home to 30% of our planet’s wildlife. - If the Amazon were destroyed, you can kiss your morning joe goodbye, in addition to fruits, rice, and CHOCOLATE, just to name a few. - In addition to oxygen and medicinal plants, we’d also lose a substantial supplier of minerals, fresh water, and food. - Science has shown that rainforests, in general, influence the climate both globally and locally. - Unhealthy soil would add to the disaster: excessive rain + unanchored soil = mudslide. Farmland and homes would be overcome with rain and mud. - Rural people will be forced into the cities, which are already home to millions. This will cause overcrowding, which comes with its own problems.

Here’s why regenerative agriculture might be the key to securing a safe and healthy future. » Subscribe to NowThis Earth: https://go.nowth.is/Future_Subscribe » Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThis Some experts claim regenerative agriculture can reverse climate change by sequestering atmospheric CO2 in soil. Regenerative organic farming emphasizes the importance of soil health and includes practices like cover cropping, crop rotation, holistic animal grazing, and the use of compost. Proponents suggest it could increase biodiversity, make farms more resilient to floods, produce healthier food, and improve farm animal welfare. 'Healthy soil equals healthy food equals healthy people,' says Jeff Moyer, the CEO of the Rodale Institute, which has studied regenerative and organic farming methods for 70 years. 'The age of chemical food production is gone. Regenerative organic agriculture is really the future.' #Agriculture #Climate #Soil #Earth #Environment #Science #NowThis Connect with NowThis » Subscribe to NowThis News: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe » Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook » Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter » Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram » Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_Snapchat NowThis Earth is daily news coverage of climate, sustainability, biodiversity, species extinction, and environmental justice, and other planetary concerns.

Help me make more videos like this via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OurChangingClimate In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how we’ve responded globally to the Coronavirus in order to understand how we should and could respond to climate change. Specifically, I look at how countries like China, South Korea, Singapore, Italy, and the United States have quickly mounted large governmental responses to the coronavirus. Covid-19 is a serious global and political crisis, but the coronavirus shows us that rapid behavioral and structural change is possible in the face of a crisis, and climate change is a crisis. The response to Coronavirus (Covid-19) has been quick and broad, the response to climate has been slow and small. If we treated climate change like we have Covid-19, also known as the coronavirus, we would be well on our way to zero-carbon future.

Don't miss Vox's Game of Thrones coverage: https://www.vox.com/game-of-thrones Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO The White Walkers are some of Thrones’ creepiest villains — but they also help tell a really interesting metaphor about climate change. For starters, the White Walkers are a threat to all humanity: Their zombie minions are equally happy to rip apart people of all nations and noble houses. Yet instead of uniting to combat the shared threat to human existence, the houses in the show spend basically all their time on their own petty disagreements and struggle for power. White Walkers are generally ignored; some nobles deny their existence outright. Swap climate change for White Walkers and ""countries"" for noble houses, and it starts to sound a lot like the real world. Specifically, it sounds like the problem of international coordination on climate change. No one country can prevent catastrophic warming on its own: Every country that's a major greenhouse gas emitter is part of the problem.

Here's How We Adapt | Alice Bows-Larkin | TED Talks	Imagine the hottest day you've ever experienced. Now imagine it's six, 10 or 12 degrees hotter. According to climate researcher Alice Bows-Larkin, that's the type of future in store for us if we don't significantly cut our greenhouse gas emissions now. She suggests that it's time we do things differently—a whole system change, in fact—and seriously consider trading economic growth for climate stability.

How could spraying chemicals into the stratosphere help counteract global warming? Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 What if you discovered a way to cool down the planet? Extreme weather events are becoming more common and more ferocious. As the surface temperature of earth continues to rise, so too will the ferocity of natural disasters. In 2018 scientists will take bold steps to explore a technology that could reverse the effects of climate-change. They’re looking at ways to reflect sunlight back into space and cool down the planet. Insurers say the number of weather-related disasters has quadrupled since 1970. While world leaders are debating and disputing climate-change and the ways in which humans alter their behaviour on earth, some scientists discuss changes to the earth itself. In 2018, they’ll take to the stratosphere to learn what it might take – or cost – to cool the planet directly. Geoengineering is the pioneering science that could well be on everyone’s lips in 2018. The team from Harvard University is the first in the world to test the effects solar geoengineering might have in the stratosphere. The experiments in 2018 won’t impact the climate, but if one day implemented, this controversial intervention could help curb extreme weather events. Solar geoengineering has the potential to save lives, but it also poses unknown risks. And there are fears that merely researching geoengineering might be detrimental to the long-term fight against climate-change. Some environmentalists say that the drive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions could be lost if there’s seen to be a quick fix. And deciding who controls a technology that affects everyone on the planet won’t be easy. Ultimately solar geoengineering could prove a risk not worth taking. But ignoring it now could be even more dangerous. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

Over the coming century, it is expected to affect agriculture, energy, health, infrastructure, natural resources, national security and water availability. This assessment, which represents the most up to date and comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on the U.S., provides critical input to planning and policy at the state and national level to reduce the human influence on climate and adapt to future change. Katharine Hayhoe, Ph.D., is director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech, part of the South-Central Climate Science Center. Her research focuses on developing and applying high-resolution climate projections to evaluate the future impacts of climate change on human society and the natural environment. Hayhoe has published more than 70 peer-reviewed publications and served as lead author on key reports for the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National Academy of Sciences. Hayhoe is currently serving as lead author for the 2014 Third U.S. National Climate Assessment. Hayhoe earned a bachelor’s of science in physics and astronomy from the University of Toronto and an M.S. and Ph.D. in atmospheric science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Donald Trump vs Joe Biden: Is 2020 a Climate Change Election? Be one of the first 200 people to sign up with this link and get 20% off your subscription with Brilliant.org! https://brilliant.org/OCC With the final Donald Trump vs Joe Biden presidential debate wrapped up and the 2020 election drawing near, this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay video looks at what's at stake for climate change when the choice is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden's climate change plan is a surprisingly progressive agenda. Climate justice and climate mitigation are headliners of Joe Biden's climate plan, and the Green New Deal is even mentioned in Biden's climate plan. Compared to Joe Biden, Donald Trump has no climate plan, and a Donald Trump presidency could spell climate change disaster. The Trump White House has spent the last year dismantling countless pieces of environmental and climate change legislation.
