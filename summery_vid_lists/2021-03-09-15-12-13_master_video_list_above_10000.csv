Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab The Green New Deal is an ambitious plan to fight the effects of climate change. It’s the only American plan that actually acknowledges the size of the impending crisis. And it contains some difficult truths that we might not want to hear. Read the Green New Deal resolution here: https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/sites/ocasio-cortez.house.gov/files/Resolution%20on%20a%20Green%20New%20Deal.pdf For additional context I recommend this piece by Vox’s Umair Irfan on the United Nations climate report, where the world’s best climatologists tell us how urgent of a problem this is: https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report This piece from Vox’s David Roberts, shows that world leaders really aren’t taking this urgency seriously. https://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13118594/2-degrees-no-more-fossil-fuels Finally, you should read this explainer of the Green New Deal, followed by this story (in list form) by Hannah Northey: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060106501 I also enjoyed this piece, from Kate Aronoff of the Intercept, that imagines a world after the Green New Deal: https://theintercept.com/2018/12/05/green-new-deal-proposal-impacts/ Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

What is Climate Change? Do you know the facts? No? Well I personally had no idea. One day it just hit me, I knew very little about climate change. Even with a useless degree in chemistry, climate change is a confusing mess of strange and difficult to understand information. I made this video to gather all the facts I could find about climate change, in a fun way, and without any bias on my part. I wanted anyone who watched this video (and myself too!) to understand all the important facts relating to climate change. Non-scientists welcome. Science is exciting! It’s just school and most of our education systems aren’t… In a few months this video will be uploaded as to remove any language or scenes not suitable for schools, so it can be used to teach about climate change in schools.

Sources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesgeoengineering By the end of the 21st century, humanity is becoming desperate. Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan... It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse. What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?

Sea levels have been rising at a greater rate year after year, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates they could rise by another meter or more by the end of this century. As National Geographic showed us in 2013, sea levels would rise by 216 feet if all the land ice on the planet were to melt. This would dramatically reshape the continents and drown many of the world's major cities.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences. It’s impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we’re committed to giving participants a fair go. In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.
