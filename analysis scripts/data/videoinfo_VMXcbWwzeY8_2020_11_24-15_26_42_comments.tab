More DIRECT sunlight reaches the higher latitudes poles. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect.<br /><br />Earth is a 4.5 billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE.<br />Dinosaurs didn&#39;t live of off the little bit of co2 unthawed released right now.<br />Nor did dinosaurs cause ClimateChange all of those other times throughout Earth&#39;s history.<br /><br />Covid19 is a Strawman built on the Baby BOOMERS turning Seniors Bust due to the usual suspects of seasonal FLU and old age.

Climate change is real and the scientists aren&#39;t lying here but I know why he is denying kind of. The last time scientists told him something and was completely wrong was when Covid-19 would end in April. Usually a virus dies out because of the humidity in the air from the heat and the humidity is heavy so it doesn&#39;t let a virus stay in the air as long, but somehow scientists forgot that a virus can mutate and adapt to any weather and told him that Covid-19 would be over in April cause of hotter weather. I can kind kind of see why he doesn&#39;t trust scientists anymore but come on this is all humans fault and we need to do something about carbon emissions and greenhouse gasses. Nature and animals should be the #1 priority in this world and without either, we all die.	UCvNC07gNwSL8JNGN8j-YieA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNC07gNwSL8JNGN8j-YieA	0

Billions of people will die if we carry on using fossil fuels and billions will die if we stop, <br />Because society, apart from a very, very, small number of people, is so dependent on them for so many things that without them society will collapse. We have to be realistic here - it is impossible, absolutely impossible to go back to a pre industrial way of life, and certainly not without the vast majority of people dying in the process. It is clear the industrial revolution should never have happened and even that society should never have left the Stone Age. But with so many more people now than there use to be only 220 years ago, when the world population <br />Was only about an 8th of what it is now, no amount of what we do now will lessen our negative impact on the environment. <br />Also, with so many nuclear weapons still around, maybe is say, Americans were serious about climate change then they should abolish all their nuclear weapons NOW, preferably with all other nations but unilaterally if necessary.<br />Also, people should not moan about Donald Trump’s position on the issue, he made it very clear that he would withdraw from the Paris Climate Treaty, a treaty even if implemented in full, will of course, it is not, will not stop the problem and at best will only slow the problem down very little,	UCrLMf19_tOogvBBsCelBMDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLMf19_tOogvBBsCelBMDA	0

Climate change is saving us by lengthening summers, resulting in longer Phytoplankton Blooms, Phytoplankton produces 50-80% of the worlds oxygen. Earth is reacting to save us from our over population growth. We need climate change to survive.	UCiYlEf7SC0Mqq5yBZEa217g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiYlEf7SC0Mqq5yBZEa217g	0

But contrary to what we are led to believe there&#39;s no scientific consensus on its causes. Many climatologists/scientists whose opinions differ from the official narrative are marginalised and denied airtime, with 16 year old &quot;experts&quot; like Greta Thunberg given excessive coverage. Can&#39;t abide Trump, but he is right. &quot;Science doesn&#39;t know.&quot;	UCy9cY0RiVILR0glQvODYDjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy9cY0RiVILR0glQvODYDjQ	0

But more importantly basically all peer reviewed papers in the topic come to the same conclusion... While the "sceptics " Make wild prediction s that don't come true...

When I was a wee lad I remember hot long summers and cold winters with snow. <br />And if we had a flood it was due to rain falling and drains being blocked and that’s when we learnt what a flood plain was and why it’s a stupid idea to build on one .. but now it seems that the later generations think that all this can be controlled and when nature reminds them that thay are insignificant. They have to have something to blame so they feel good That is climate change.	UCY3kcfu1syUotFtiwTOKG6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY3kcfu1syUotFtiwTOKG6A	0

The tree sheds lower limbs and needles to build up fuel to help nurture a fire to allow the forest to respawn and grow. No fire, no natural growth. This is one of many species that use fire. The forests of western USA require fire to live and be healthy. We&#39;ve imposed our will on a natural system to support an idealogical viewpoint.

The planet is going to get colder and it’s all to do with the Sun and nothing to do with so called ‘man induced climate change’. In fact we are probably going to be wiped out in 2046. Think I’m crazy? Do your research and stop listening to mainstream media. The US government and the CIA have known since the 1950s. See Douglas Vogt, Diehold Foundation series 4 to see the physical evidence of this recurring catastrophe. And that is the tip of a very big iceberg.

But because Trump mentioned it its kept in the shadows. Very corrupt media and governments worldwide conspire to cause death through disinformation to gain numbers and prove this plannedemic.

In addition, some fires are caused by arsons and human activity it's hard to ignore that majority of these fires grew out of control because of dangerous heatwaves hitting the west coast, Dry lightning storms, and dry conditions which are caused by climate change fueling the flame.

Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.

Ugz8FIIcvPk6a3_Hrhl4AaABAg	1	1	2020-09-15 04:43:40	Sam C 95	I think lots of people in the comments are missing the point. The point isn&#39;t how the fires started (arson or not), it&#39;s about how far and wide they can spread and how they are becoming less controllable and more frequent, and the reasons behind that determined by science. It&#39;s not just the US breaking wildfire records in the last two years - it&#39;s the Amazon, it&#39;s Australia as well... it&#39;s a global problem.<br />And it&#39;s not just the fires, it&#39;s an increase in extreme weather, it&#39;s increased frequency and severity of flooding, increased frequency and severity of droughts, it&#39;s average global and local temperatures, ice caps melting, glaciers receding, it&#39;s sea levels rising, atmosphere and hydrosphere CO2 concentrations coupled with a basic understanding of physics.<br />And of course scientists who dedicate their lives to their field of study have considered something as simple as how the fires started. This is literally not a debate, it is a fact	UC_Q3I2Pq2QuDLR9ThO3wLVw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Q3I2Pq2QuDLR9ThO3wLVw	0

In an article published in May it says "The warming caused by the greenhouse gas emissions from the human burning of fossil fuels is six times greater than the possible decades-long cooling from a prolonged Grand Solar Minimum," wrote the NASA Global Climate Change team in February. "Even if a Grand Solar Minimum were to last a century, global temperatures would continue to warm. Because more factors than just variations in the Sun's output change global temperatures on Earth, the most dominant of those today being the warming coming from human-induced greenhouse gas emissions."

I'm no conspiracy theorist but I have seen some news on people starting fires along some motorway and seems to be an organised attack rather then clearing land for farming.

However, the tinder-dry conditions are in the main caused by unusual but by no means unique unstable jet stream patterns which cause the extremes of weather and temperature to stagnate over specific areas. It is not co2 forcing which controls the jet streams but solar activity the moon the sea and gravity and as we are entering a solar minimum we can expect wilder Jetstream fluctuations and increased vulcanism	UCW71H9_r-Phg-srFVTjhb9w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW71H9_r-Phg-srFVTjhb9w	0

Personally i strongly believe we're effecting the weather of our planet, but i don't think our actions are as astronomical as implied, i think we're accelerating the rate in which our planet progresses through its natural stages. there are historical accounts of warm and cold periods over hundreds/thousands of years.

The climate is always changing due to a mixture of natural variability, the influence of the sun, and man-made factors. In the interest of balance, here is a recent take on California&#39;s fires from Tony Heller which includes some historical context showing that the fires have been worse in the past:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BalXOmnHTk&amp;t=329s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BalXOmnHTk&amp;t=329s</a>	UCoxSxI1v_EhQgx0C9-dVQJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxSxI1v_EhQgx0C9-dVQJg	0

Global temperatures have been accelerating for the past century according to both satellite and land/ocean temperature measurements across the globe. *Climate change is a catch-all term for all the consequences of global warming* , such as sea level rise, glacial retreat, sea ice decline, wildfire and desertification frequency/extent, etc. Both are observed facts reported by thousands of research studies internationally in peer-reviewed journals, independent of political ideals. This is an international issue, not an American political talking point. Please educate yourselves.

Trump warned them and they said No.. it was another BS headline talking about how California and all these Democrat ran regions refused to heed that advice. 2019 they lost their properties to fire and 2020 they are still losing their properties to fire because they are so filled with anger at Trump they would rather lose everything.. idiots.

UgwxOEGTj4F2QJOBys94AaABAg	2	16	2020-09-15 00:00:16	Rob Tyman	This is such a serious issue, and yet the President looks bored - I&#39;m staggered. You&#39;d think even for someone not known for their love of environmental issues, he&#39;d be concerned.....but he appears not to be. Instead he flips everything on its head by blaming the governor of California along with environmental secretaries instead of trying to understand what&#39;s actually happened...and offering support (and aid) to those affected. It&#39;s unbelievable, and shocking, but unsurprising really. <br /><br />All Trump cares about is money and making money. He lives, breathes and sleeps this. Everything else is a distraction or an irritation. He really should not be P of the USA, as four years in, and I still don&#39;t believe he understands the true nature of the job. If America re-elect him, then the country will start to fall apart big time - civil unrest on a scale not seen before. America now is going through tougher times than it did in the 1960&#39;s civil rights heyday. <br /><br />Americans laughed at us in the UK when we were &#39;tearing ourselves apart&#39; over Brexit, but protesters weren&#39;t being beaten up by police officers, nor were police officers getting shot at point blank range by utter lunatics, nor were cities across the UK seeing night after night of violent riots culminating in petrol bombs being thrown at Police. To us Brits, America looks like a country that&#39;s now right on the edge of stability and normality. It looks quite frightening if I&#39;m honest. <br /><br />It&#39;s not helped by a bellicose and volatile President who appears to get a kick out of &#39;baiting&#39; those who he doesn&#39;t agree with in a particularly nasty manner, or those whose views he considers irrelevant. The world sorely needs an America that has its head screwed on, and who can be relied upon for sound advice and reasoned opinion. Right now I don&#39;t see any of this. America is in a right mess, and it&#39;s pretty unedifying to watch.	UCYQiua1lIr0EaIHIiTuWAoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYQiua1lIr0EaIHIiTuWAoQ	0

The scientists DO NOT &quot;KNOW&quot;! <br />Mankind performs activities, that means the world can not be seen in a way that it would be without it. Climate change happens anyway (this is provable) and on a scale very similar to what we are going through anyway. <br />Computer models only have data from times when the activities needed to turn them on were around. They can only predict what would be happening otherwise and we are talking about small percentages even before we start modeling.<br />In any case none of this matters at all!<br />When renuables are cheaper than fossil fuels, then that is what we will use. When new sustainable materials are created, then that is how we will build. <br />When Trump says &quot;it will get cooler&quot;, I imagine he thinks like this.<br />If climate change happens irrespective of our activities then there is not too much we can do about it anyway. Turning off the lights may stop it getting warmer, but it is more likely time to start thinking properly about how to actually cool down a planet.

Climate change simply shifts the baseline such that it takes less to get to the threshold. The scientific evidence behind this is solid. Those ascribing a single cause to these fires are wrong, given they require other prerequisite conditions. However, global warming is undoubtedly one of these variables that is making fires more likely. As for your point regarding climatic instability. The stability of global temperatures fluctuates on a timescale of thousands/millions of years. The change we're seeing has occurred within a hundred-or-so years. The rate of these changes are rare in history and are often associated with massive, catastrophic events, such as supervolcano eruptions or meteor impacts. These are the kind of events that lead to mass extinctions and are not the kind of thing we should emulate.

Jeff Acord (the lone 'BLM activist'), Christine Comello, Milton Loran, Elias Pendergrass. It's one thing to say that this wasn't a co-ordinated effort, fair enough.

The only flat earther I've ever met, was also the only qualified pilot! Having said that I cant see how it effects a virus....oxygen is lethal to them anyway, hence hiding in animal guts.

The fires here were started from human error but the reason it was able to spread to quickly was the drier vegetation caused by extreme evaporation which was caused by global warming. While we can try our best to prevent people starting fires or just being dioits we cant its literally impossible and is very difficult as probability states that it will occur.

Ugy_kZDzbgRMwchavOd4AaABAg.9Db1eCwsayH9DbtYDfY1ew		1	2020-09-15 06:11:13	HnTv	Yea but the mass evaporation thanks to global warming has allowed it to rage on for soo long and spread to quickly. That's the major issues here. It's stupid to think that people wont make accidents which cause these fires but that doesn't matter, what matters is how can we prevent it from becoming a large fire which can dramatically alter e environment in ways that cause death. For example the fire also allowed carbon out which bonded would oxygen this means the air quality in the area is dramatically lower than before and has become dangerous to some forms of life, aka humans.

To be clear it's not a good argument for me because everytime it happened faster it was a mass extinction event. However my point still remains that the industrial revolution which is 200years old is responsible for advancement and technology that will not only be able to negate the negative effects but even reverse it. Denmark ran 100% on green energy last Christmas, all cars are going to be electric in the next 30 years or less, green energy is teh future and is only possible due to the industrial revolution. We can't go back and we shouldn't if we could. A few hundred years of increased pollution is a small price to pay for where we will end up, putting sanctions and restrictions on this to "prevent" global warming is a counter productive.

As far as I know, Oregon shouldn't be close enough to the equator to be extremely hot and climate patterns so far suggests that it should've been more wet and cold, however, in just a few years, it's no longer the case and that sudden change of a few years is unnatural	UCKCq_K4CcdYJHyHkCKQL2kQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKCq_K4CcdYJHyHkCKQL2kQ	1	Ugy8M-Ydyrdc9cItNk54AaABAg	Athul Kathul

No one really has the right answer. This is when money goes out the window on deals like " The Green New Deal" Why raise taxes and increase regulations to suit a guessing game? The funniest part of people wanting to have a small carbon footprint is that they drive hybrid vehicles and take planes often. I Live in Portland. I know thousands of people whom push for cleaner air yet they do all the things to help speed up the process. Look Fires, Earthquackes and Hurricans have happend before us and will surely occur after us. I agree we should slow that process down..

There is plenty we can do to reduce green house gases in the atmosphere, it's the lobbyists, ignorant deniers and corporate paid bunk scientist who make it politically impossible to do anything significant.

Its also important to say that previous spikes in temperature and massive climate change has happened much quicker on this planet due to global natural disasters, so let's not suggest this is the fasted it's ever changed. The fact is the industrial revolution has caused this rapid change, but that same revolution will and already does give us green renewable energy advanced understanding of our planet and technology, it is a necessary part of our advancement and pollution is a unfortunate side effect.

The climate has fluctuated in the past yes, but its the rate relative to evolutionary rate that allows species to adapt and change to this. Current climate change is happening so fast (<5 human generations before certain irreversible damage) that no species will have the time to adapt via evolution. We may survive as a species, with the loss of billions of lives and the majority of the world as habitable locations, but it will likely just be us and some microbes.

Gavin is fast at forcing a narrative here with his sentiment statement he does not understand science knows no sentiment obviously! So waiting for investigations to conclude rather that attempting to force agenda sounds suspicious! He has fire fighting helicopters that could of been used to put the fires out in Afghanistan! another issue to be address in the investigations.

Consequently the very same creepy crawlies environments which the eco mentalists were so keen to save have now been destroyed by the massive fires!

I mean I am pretty mad at this. Climate change is real and the scientists aren't lying here but I know why he is denying kind of. The last time scientists told him something and was completely wrong was when Covid-19 would end in April. Usually a virus dies out because of the humidity in the air from the heat and the humidity is heavy so it doesn't let a virus stay in the air as long, but somehow scientists forgot that a virus can mutate and adapt to any weather and told him that Covid-19 would be over in April cause of hotter weather. I can kind kind of see why he doesn't trust scientists anymore but come on this is all humans fault and we need to do something about carbon emissions and greenhouse gasses. Nature and animals should be the #1 priority in this world and without either, we all die.

Some people just don’t buy into junk science based on flawed computer models. What is the “correct” temperature for the earth anyway? We still don’t understand every factor that cause changes in climate. So how can computer models without correct data be trusted?
