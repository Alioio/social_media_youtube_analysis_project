title	Trump slammed for denying climate change's role in US wildfires
description	Donald Trump was challenged by Californian officials about his earlier comments that bad forest management, rather than climate change, was to blame for the wildfires along the US West Coast. On his visit to the state, the US President said "it'll start getting cooler - you just watch" to a civil servant, who replied: "I wish science agreed with you." Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called Mr Trump's denial of climate change "unconscionable", saying these "hellish events" will become more frequent if he wins a second term.
